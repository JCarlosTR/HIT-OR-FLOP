Did you ever have to make up your mind?
Pick up on one and leave the other one behind
It's not often easy, and not often kind
Did you ever have to make up your mind?

Did you ever have to finally decide?
Say yes to one and let the other one ride
There's so many changes, and tears you must hide
Did you ever have to finally decide?

Sometimes there's one with deep blue eyes, cute as a bunny
With hair down to here, and plenty of money
And just when you think she's that one in the world
Your heart gets stolen by some mousy little girl
And then you know you better make up your mind
Pick up on one and leave the other one behind
It's not often easy, and not often kind
Did you ever have to make up your mind?

Sometimes you really dig a girl the moment you kiss her
And then you get distracted by her older sister
When in walks her father and takes you in line
And says "Better go home, son, and make up your mind"
Then you bet you'd better finally decide!
And say yes to one and let the other one ride
There's so many changes, and tears you must hide
Did you ever have to finally decide?

Well I know I'm just an ignorant Englishman
But I'd like to make America great again
So if you'll forgive my accent and the cheek of it
Here's some suggestions from the special relationship

Let's make America great again
By making racists ashamed again
Let's make compassion in fashion again
Let's make America great again

Well I've been fortunate to go round the continent
From California through the Midwest to Providence
And I've mostly only encountered common sense
Hospitality and warmth from Americans
But I wish it was a bit less significant
The program and the name of the president
Because it seems to me the truth is self evident
You fought our king to be independent

Make America great again
By making racists ashamed again
Let's make compassion in fashion again
Let's make America great again

Ellis Island take me in
Everyone can start again
In the shining city on the hill
Where nobody can be illegal

Let's make America great again
By making racists ashamed again
Let's make compassion in fashion again
Let's make America great again
Let's be a friend to our oldest friends
And call them out when they're faltering
Remind them of their best selves and then
We'll make America great again
---------------------------------------------------
Down you wait too long
For you and the wave don't belong
If you stay, it's your fault, it's yours, come on
Minds get blown, those dots connect, lines get drawn
But something draws me to you even more
And that something draws me to you
Something draws me to you
That something's got a hold on me
Takin' me higher than this ecstasy
I'm thinkin', ooh you drive me crazy
Ooh you drive me maybe, the wheel to take control of me

Minds get lost, dots connect, lines get drawn
But something draws me to you even more
And that something draws me to you
Something draws me to you
That something's got a hold on me

I said take control, don't take too long, the sky might fall
We all go through our phases, habits won't fade, these things evolve
So take your medication
That's only temporary aid, you need your salvation
Up your doses when it's less effective

I'll be your prisoner take me, I'll surrender my faith

We can't escape attraction, the chain reaction make me your slave
Minds get lost, dots connect, lines get drawn
But something draws me to you even more
And that something draws me to you
Something draws me to you
That something's got a hold on me
Takin' me higher than this earth can see
I'm thinkin', "Ooh you drive me crazy
Ooh you drive me maybe, the wheel to take control of me

Take control of me
Take control of me
Take control of me
Take control of me

See I can call again, call it that, something is drawin' me closer
Yeah, I'm drownin' my head above water, there ain't no warnin'
I will follow that light at the end of the tunnel, I want it
If it glows out, I'm cool with the darkness
Do anything for it, I promise I need it, your beauty is beamin'
I'm trapped in your glory, I can't ignore it
This feeling I'm feelin', I'm an infant I'm reachin'
At this point I'm dependin', pray I'm goin' the distance

But I know something's got a hold on me
Takin' me higher than this extasy?
Ooh you drive me crazy
Ooh you drive me maybe
The wheel to take control of me
But I know something's got a hold on me
Takin' me higher than this extasy
Ooh you drive me crazy
Ooh you drive me maybe
The wheel to take control of me

Stop asking musicians what they think
He said softly as he poured himself a second drink
And outside, the world slipped over the brink
We all thought we had nothing to lose
That we could trust in crossed fingers and horseshoes
That everything would work out, no matter what we choose

The first time it was a tragedy
The second time it's a farce
Outside it's 1933 so I'm hitting the bar

But I don't know what's going on anymore
The world outside is burning with a brand new light
But it isn't one that makes me feel warm
Don't go mistaking your house burning down for the dawn
Don't go mistaking your house burning down for the dawn

If I was of the greatest generation I'd be pissed
Surveying the world that I built, slipping back into this
I'd be screaming at my grand kids: "We already did this"
Be suspicious of simple answers
That shit's for fascists and maybe teenagers
You can't fix the world if all you have is a hammer

The first time it was a tragedy
The second time it's a farce
Outside it's 1933 so I'm hitting the bar

But I don't know what's going on anymore
The world outside is burning with a brand new light
But it isn't one that makes me feel warm
Don't go mistaking your house burning down for the dawn
Don't go mistaking your house burning down for the dawn
For the dawn

Aren't you ashamed of this? I surely hope that you are
Living in a society that's maybe heading for Mars
But down here we still have a shower of bastards leading the charge
Outside it's 1933 so I am hitting the bar

But I don't know what's going on anymore
The world outside is burning with a brand new light
But it isn't one that makes me feel warm
Don't go mistaking your house burning down for the dawn
(Don't go mistaking your house burning down for the dawn)
Don't go mistaking your house burning down for the dawn
(Don't go mistaking your house burning down for the dawn)
Don't go mistaking your house burning down for the dawn
(Don't go mistaking your house burning down for the dawn)
Don't go mistaking your house burning down for the dawn

Hey, shut out Damso
Merci
Skr

(These bitches wanna hate on me
I came from the bottom, I build my empire
And these bitches wanna take my shit
But it's all okay, okay, okay
But is all okay, okay, okay
But is all okay)

These bitches wanna hate on me
I came from the bottom I build my empire
And this bitches wanna take my shit
But it's all okay, okay, okay
But it's all okay, okay, okay
But it's all okay

Dile a tu piba que se pase el bong
El trap en Espana e' una abominacion
Tuvo que llegar el blanquito de fuera
A prenderlo en la hoguera pa' partirlo en dos
Soy mejor que ellos, tal vez es por eso que quieran tirarme
Yo no peleo manito, yo tengo al moreno ready pal' desmadre

He visto que flipabais con mi Photoshop a los quince
Y ahora a los veinte mis videos son pelis mejor que de Spielberg
Dime tu que estabas haciendo por esas edades manito
Estabais todos en el cole, ninguno en el punto e' perico

Hold on think about it, never said that I move coca
I said that my homie get bricks in the kitchen, he used to bake soda
Now many haters are talking they wanna see me go broke up
I ain't worry bout nothin' I'm selling my weed and I'm sellin' a lotta
Young designer making clothes, sipping codeine in my double Cup
We making the music, we making conexion, your music under attack
I'm making a three on three, it's trap brand rap
That's why you can't stop me my homie, my empire is going up

These bitches wanna hate on me
I came from the bottom, I build my empire
And these bitches wanna take my shit
But it's all okay, okay, okay
But is all okay, okay, okay
But is all okay

These bitches wanna hate on me
I came from the bottom, I build my empire
And this bitches wanna take my shit
But it's all okay, okay, okay
But it's all okay, okay, okay
But it's all okay

Now we gon' blow up
Now all this bitches waiting for the come up
I don't give a fuck, I told my momma be ready for the incomers
Lyrics hitting like a Lamma
Also designing clothes make me multiply the lana
Selling Dope just to feed the blocka
Paparazis take photoshooting Placa Placa

Voy por delante de vosotros, en letras en formas, talento, que tu mas quieres
Todos sabeis darle al coco pero al darle al coco no teneis la mente
Yo me construyo mi imperio con todo mi ingenio pa' sacarme siempre los verde
Por eso aunque no sea el Chapo y no venda de todo siempre tengo en la cartera un par de cienes

I was on Paris, meeting designers of Dolce&Gabanna
I've been on the streets of The Six, we gon' be back por mi mama
I don't give a fuck
¿Dices que no he vivi'o calle y que la calle habla?
Manito la calle esta ciega, sorda, coja y no ve nada
Con mi ropa facturo mas que tu con tu coca barata
Con mi musica muevo mas droga que toda tu ganga
Bitch got me flexing, weed plug smoking like a rasta
I'm so fast you can call me Nascar
Don't stop, catch him like a monster

These bitches wanna hate on me
I came from the bottom, I build my empire
And these bitches wanna take my shit
But it's all okay, okay, okay
But is all okay, okay, okay
But is all okay

These bitches wanna hate on me
I came from the bottom, I build my empire
And these bitches wanna take my shit
But it's all okay, okay, okay
But it's all okay, okay, okay
But it's all okay

There's a place in my mind
That I lost
So you'll have to find yourself
'Cause it takes so much time
To say goodbye

There's a place in my mind
That I lost
So you'll have to find yourself
You're better off in your case
You'll get by
Despite the cost of it
You'll just have to find yourself

You never really tried to rest your case
Just in case
You never get to tie your own noose
To escape
'Cause it takes so much time
To say goodbye

There's a place in my mind
That I lost
Where you resided in
So you'll have to find yourself
A place where no one minds
And there's no consequence
For you to go and tie your own noose

You never really tried to rest your case
Just in case
You never get to tie your own noose
To escape
'Cause it takes so much time
To say goodbye
'Cause it takes so much time
To say goodbye
Say goodbye

Try to rest your case just in case
You never get to tie your own noose
To escape
'Cause it takes so much time
'Cause it takes so much time
'Cause it takes so much time
To say goodbye

Tom and Johnny yeah we're low on cash
Noisemaker, dream chaser
Still crashing at my parents pad
Coming up and I want it so bad
Debaser, game changer
And the weekend will be so damn rad

Freaks go out, gonna drown our fears
Brains go numb, bodies get so weird
We fight so hard for new vibration
Oh oh oh they'll have to carry us home
Oh oh oh they'll have to carry us home
Oh oh oh they'll have to carry us home
We fight so hard for new vibration
Oh oh oh they'll have to carry us home
We fight so hard for new vibration
Oh oh oh they'll have to carry us home

Like a walk of shame
Love sick again
And I'm stumbling
Breaking even when I wake up dazed
I think I might've left the car unlocked
My shades are gone, whose shoes I got on?
But whatever 'cause we pay to play

Freaks go out, gonna drown our fears
Brains go numb, bodies get so weird
We fight so hard for new vibration
Oh oh oh they'll have to carry us home
Oh oh oh they'll have to carry us home
Oh oh oh they'll have to carry us home
We fight so hard for new vibration
Oh oh oh they'll have to carry us home
We fight so hard for new vibration
Oh oh oh they'll have to carry us home

Freaks go out, gonna drown our fears
Brains go numb, bodies get so weird
We fight so hard for new vibration
Oh oh oh they'll have to carry us home

Freaks go out (gonna carry us home)
Brains go numb, bodies get so (gonna carry us home)
We fight so hard for new vibration
Oh oh oh they'll have to carry us home
---------------------------------------------------
Never mind how I'm keeping
As of right now, I'm losing it as if I had it in the first place
Running water in the bathroom
It's 3 AM and I can't sleep, I don't even recognize me

Ooh paranoia
I can't avoid you

Say what you wanna, say how you wish I could feel
Like the others, another lover that you had before
Say what you wanna, oh, say how you wish I could feel
Like the others, another lover that you had before

Ooh, ooh, ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah
Ooh, ooh, ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah

Let me at it, I'm tired of it pestering me
I can't get rid of it 'cause killing it's like pulling my own teeth
One, two, three, I stop, because it's bleeding
And I realise my nervous mind is stuck inside

Ooh paranoia
I can't avoid you

Say what you wanna, say how you wish I could feel
Like the others, another lover that you had before
Say what you wanna, oh, say how you wish I could feel
Like the others, another lover that you had before

Ooh, ooh, ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah
Ooh, ooh, ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah

There you go, you're saying I'll be fine but I won't
Brush it under the bed, another time but it won't stay down
You're crawling into my mind and out my mouth
I'm scared you're not mine and you want out

Say what you wanna, say how you wish I could feel
Like the others, another lover that you had before
Say what you wanna, oh, say how you wish I could feel
Like the others, another lover that you had before

Ooh, ooh, ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah
Ooh, ooh, ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah

On n’a pas toujours ce qu’on veut
Meme quand on poursuit ses reves
On n’a pas toujours ce qu’on veut
Meme quand on poursuit ses reves
Meme quand on poursuit ses reves


Encore un soir, encore deux/trois barres, encore affale (et alors)
J'trouve pas d'taff depuis trois semaines tu fais que d'chercher
Tu repenses a ton passe, quand tu faisais du sale, l'argent sous le matelas
Tu disais : "Maman j'vais tout arreter, toi et moi faut qu'on s'barre de la" (argh!)
Mais ces encules rappellent pas (ouais)
J'veux m'reinserer mais j'arrive pas
La journee j'te promets j’arrete pas, mais j'vois tous mes potos quand j'rentre a la raque-ba
"Ouais frero on t'vois plus, wesh tu fais quoi ?
T'as pas trouve d'taff, c'est dommage mon reu-fre
S'tu veux y'a un bon plavon, un gros paftar on va p't'etre prendre c'que tu prendrais en une annee"
C'est trop frustrant la tentation, maman s'te plait dis moi on fait quoi (on fait quoi maman la ?)
T'as une vieille retraite et deux loyers en retard, pour que tu sois bien dis moi on fait quoi (hein?)
Jamais baisse mon pantalon, avec toi toujours avale ma fierte
Desole j'finirais dans la rue, car elle n'a pas fait preuve de fair-play


On n’a pas toujours ce qu’on veut
Meme quand on poursuit ses reves
On n’a pas toujours ce qu’on veut
Meme quand on poursuit ses reves
Memento Mori
Meme quand on poursuit ses reves

Oublie ta peur quand tu marches sur le fil
L’amour acrobate en desequilibre
Je me tais et j’entends ce que ma petite voix me dit
Memento Mori, Memento Mori
Oublie ta peur quand tu marches sur le fil
L’amour acrobate en desequilibre
Je me tais et j’entends ce que ma petite voix me dit
Memento Mori, Memento Mori


Les annees passent, tu sors enfin, t'as fais trois ans pleins (ouais)
T'as reflechis, t'as compris qu'la rue c'est pas ton destin
Tu rentres pour voir la daronne, un pote t'as trouve un travail faut lui annoncer
Tu passes chez un pote prendre de l'argent juste avant pour soigner ton arrivee
Puis tu passes la porte de chez toi (hein)
Y'a qu'le p'tit reuf maman n'est pas la (hein)
Le daron vient juste d'arriver en urgence car elle est devenue gravement malade (elle est ou maman la ?!)
Dis moi la rue elle sert a quoi si tu peux pas etre au pied de la madre (elle est ou maman la ?! Elle est ou maman la ?!)
Elle etait stressee, le p'tit frere qui prend les memes chemins qu'son grand reu-fre (putain)
Il veut faire des thunes a la mort, il est devenu irrespectueux quand t'es parti au chtar (Eh il est ou lui aussi la ?! Il est ou la ?!)
Ta mere lui disait de pas sortir le soir, poto il rentrait grave tard (putain)
Des larmes sur l'oreiller, ma mere s'est noyee dans ses problemes
La juge t'as fixe ta ne-pei, et ca n'a fait qu'aggraver sa peine


On n’a pas toujours ce qu’on veut
Meme quand on poursuit ses reves
On n’a pas toujours ce qu’on veut

Oublie ta peur quand tu marches sur le fil

Crooked old barefoot shovin' it across the outdoor dancefloor like you ain't got no sense
His new girlfriend found her a pretty good fella I guess that she's into rednecks

Oh my, no lie: y'all better hold on tight
We got a lot of ice-cold cheap beer flowin' around here, lord wish we had all night
But the mornin's gonna come and it won't be no fun for anyone

Watch out for Miss comin' up to you, leanin' up on you, wanna take you home tonight
She got herself a six-foot-fiver Mac Truck driver comin' in hot, and he loves to fight

Oh my, no lie: she'll put it on you in a minute
In a double-wide cheetah print silk sheet queen-size, it's sure cozy while you're in it
But the mornin's gonna come and it won't be no fun for anyone, son

Oh my, no lie: there ain't no turnin' back now
And you can't un-think what you already done
And the moonlight's gonna burn out
And the mornin's gonna come and it won't be no fun for anyone
Yeah the mornin's gonna come and it won't be no fun for anyone
---------------------------------------------------
Before I knew you
I did bad things and didn't know why
But now, I know you
And I've learned to look inside
I understand what makes me
Frightened and sad
So, yes, I still do bad things
But are they actually bad?
No!

Because nothing is ever anyone's fault
We're all just products of childhood trauma
Nothing is ever anyone's fault
Pain causes anger and fear causes drama
We can't control
The things we do
Just like I can't control
That I'm in love with you


Wow, the first part was kind of amoral, but the last thing was really sweet


Thanks


What else?


I was raised to believe
That every person's in charge of their fate
But now, I clearly see
That my father's a dick and he filled me with hate
You were the first person who told me that


Maybe you have a point
I was brought up by a fat-shaming mom
Who made me take laxatives
The week before prom (yep!)
Now, I overeat ever since that abuse


See?
Psychology is a great excuse


Nothing is ever anyone's fault


Nothing is ever anyone's fault


John Wayne Gacy was hit by his dad


Exactly!
It wasn't technically Hitler's fault


Wasn't technically Hitler's fault


Hitler's brother died


And that made him super sad
It's hard to paint people with evil or glory
When you know that everyone's
Got a tragic backstory
Free will's an illusion
Morality is, too
So, it's not my fault that
My parents messed me up
'Cause their parents messed them up
And Adam and Eve were messed up by god
Who was messed up originally by the big bang
Everything is the big bang's fault!


Good point!
Energy in space was the ultimate bad father


Nothing is nobody's fault


Nothing is nobody's
Is that a double negative?


Eh, it sounds good, why bother?
But I'm glad for the trauma


I'm glad for it, too


'Cause my past is what led me
To fall in love with you

Le sang deviendra jamais de l'eau (jamais)
M'en veux pas si j'deviens parano
J'suis venu, j'repartirai solo (bah ouais)
Ensemble depuis minot les gadjos
Ensemble depuis minot les gadjos, j'oublie pas d'ou l'on vient le chemin est tres long
Passer du terrain d'foot au pilon
L'guetteur criait "ca passe !", calait ca dans l'calecon
Mais, j'avance tranquillement, pepele avec les loups d'la bande
Pose dans l'batiment, un mort-vivant vient reclamer sa mort
Je souris, tout est bon mais bon, tu sais pas c'que j'vis derriere, c'est gore
Batard tu viens m'la pepom que quand l'buzz toc-toc a ma porte


La rue la vraie, le temps passe, j'reconnais les vrais (les vrais)
La rue la vraie, la solution a tes problemes
C'est comme ca qu'on regle les affaires (ah ouais)
Quoi qu'il arrive, j'surveille tes arrieres (mon frere)
La rue la vraie (la rue la vraie)
La rue la vraie (ouais)


La rue la vraie, depuis tout petit gros j'connais mes reperes
Et la nuit j'suis du-per, j'me leve et j'ai des cernes
J'enchaine des showcases et toi tu grattes des pieces
Toujours dans l'fond du binks, mais j'suis plus sur le r
La peuf viens de Namek, la verte comme Piccolo
J'ai pas besoin de lecon pour rentrer des euros
J'ai toujours le bras long comme le mec au chapeau
J'suis tombe du berceau, pour finir dans l'hall
Gros, j'ai les crocs et j'vais briser les dos
J'tire une barre et j'me tue les neurones
Faut qu'j'me casse et finir sur la cote
Les condes ils nous pistent, donc j'vais casser ma SIM
Mailler pour la famille, le Mondeo me siffle
Faut que je les vesqui et mission accomplie
J'kiff toujours la bibi mais mon cœur est maudit
Binks


La rue la vraie, le temps passe, j'reconnais les vrais (les vrais)
La rue la vraie, la solution a tes problemes
C'est comme ca qu'on regle les affaires (ah ouais)
Quoi qu'il arrive, j'surveille tes arrieres (mon frere)
La rue la vraie (la rue la vraie)
La rue la vraie


Desavantage jamais privilegie donc je charbonne deux fois plus pour etre aux sommet
Assure toi d'etre vraie pour etre bien entoure
Si toi meme t'es faux, l'entourage peut pas etre vraie
Fuck ceux qui parle, qui veulent decourager
Besoin d'ta copine juste pour me soulager
Elle donnerait son cul juste pour prendre de l'argent
A part la signature y'a rien qui ger-chan
T'etais present quand j'allais bien
Mais j't'ai pas vu quand j'etais dans l'mal
Quand c'est chaud, on sait qui baisse les armes
Quand c'est chaud, on sait qui baisse les armes


La rue la vraie, le temps passe, j'reconnais les vrais (les vrais)
La rue la vraie, la solution a tes problemes
C'est comme ca qu'on regle les affaires (ah ouais)
Quoi qu'il arrive, j'surveille tes arrieres (mon frere)
La rue la vraie (la rue la vraie)
La rue la vraie

On a commence dans l'binks, j'en ai vu retourner leurs vestes
Le temps passe et j'vois ceux qui restent et ca fait mal, ca fait mal
On a commence dans l'binks, j'en ai vu retourner leurs vestes
Le temps passe et j'vois ceux qui restent et ca fait mal, ca fait mal

Maman m'a dit : "Te retourne pas sinon mon fils, tu vas tomber"
Aujourd'hui, j'ai des projets, hier, j'voyais pas plus loin qu'mon nez
Ouais, j'peux t'rapper la rue car tous les jours, j'y mets les pieds
Les keufs, ils frappent car ils savent qu'le p'tit d'quinze ans prend plus de ble qu'eux
Ouais, ouais, Mad'moiselle t'es trop belle, t'es trop charmante, t'es jolie
Une meuf comme toi dans nos cites, c'est tel-ho toute la nuit
Toi, j'vois que c'est pas l'cas, en tout cas j'espere ma jolie
J'suis l'p'tit francais d'la tess aux yeux bleus avec un grain malpoli
Tous les jours : que du sale, j'me fais reveiller par l'gyro'
Nan, j'dirais pas les blazes mais tous les jours, j'vois deux trois quatre gerants
Au tieks a installe la frappe mais pas celle d'Aguero, ca fait des sses-pas comme au foot, j'peux t'dire qu'y'a beaucoup d'adherents
J'ai la
avec le mic, mes flows prennent des virages
Sourire aux levres depuis qu'apres la pluie n'vient plus l'orage
Et si un jour je perce, on dira que j'ai change
Quand j'avais pas un poto, on etait deux etrangers

On a commence dans l'binks, j'en ai vu retourner leurs vestes
Le temps passe et j'vois ceux qui restent et ca fait mal, ca fait mal
On a commence dans l'binks, j'en ai vu retourner leurs vestes
Le temps passe et j'vois ceux qui restent et ca fait mal, ca fait mal

Yeah, yeah, eh, au quartier t'as mis que des carnas, personne sait trop ou t'es, dans l'9.3 ou a Punta Cana
T'as investi sur un Vespa, chez moi ca baraude en cross un peu comme dans les rues d'Atlanta
On sait pas d'quoi est fait demain gros donc on veut les gains
Les grands prennent au cafe, les p'tits arrachent des sacs a mains
J'traine avec des soi-disants cas desesperes, Madame j'ai des potes qui font du sale pour qu'la madre puisse payer l'loyer
La vie, elle t'ouvre la porte, elle peut t'ouvrir des culs d'sac
T'as pris un bon billet, moi, j'en suis sur, c'etait un coup d'chatte
Eh, et les blemes-pro, moi, je veux plus d'ca mais j'suis d'la rue, la vraie un peu comme mon gars
Pour histoire de terrain, ca s'fait la guerre comme dans Vikings
C'est soit tu taffes ou soit tu dors poto, y'a pas d'enigme
Et quand j'suis pas chez moi, j'me sens comme un etranger
Et si demain y'a guerre, je sais qui y'aura dans ma tranchee

On a commence dans l'binks, j'en ai vu retourner leurs vestes
Le temps passe et j'vois ceux qui restent et ca fait mal, ca fait mal
On a commence dans l'binks, j'en ai vu retourner leurs vestes
Le temps passe et j'vois ceux qui restent et ca fait mal, ca fait mal

On a commence dans l'binks, j'en ai vu retourner leurs vestes
Le temps passe et j'vois ceux qui restent et ca fait mal, ca fait mal

Never ever gonna make the same mistakes again
And by the way
No one else could ever make me feel this good
But I'm all right
I swear that I'm all right again
Hope is in my veins
And I swear that I'm okay
Someone take me home

Is this important?
Can it wait a day?
I promise I'll be there
But do you need me, anyway?

I could leave this
I have control, I'm fine
That's not lip service
I talk circles all the time

'Cause I know that you know
That I need fixed tonight
So please don't worry

Never ever gonna make the same mistakes again
And by the way
No one else could ever make me feel this good
But I'm all right
I swear that I'm all right again
Hope is in my veins
And I swear that I'm okay
Someone take me home

I could leave this
But I don't want to
And if I fall
I hope it's not in front of you

'Cause I know that you know
That I need fixed tonight
So please don't worry

Never ever gonna make the same mistakes again
And by the way
No one else could ever make me feel this good
But I'm all right
I swear that I'm all right again
Hope is in my veins
And I swear that I'm okay
Someone take me home

Never ever gonna make the same mistakes again
And by the way
No one else could ever make me feel this good
But I'm all right
Yeah I'm all right
Yeah I'm all right
Yeah I'm all right

Never ever gonna make the same mistakes again
And by the way
No one else could ever make me feel this good
But I'm all right
I swear that I'm all right again
Hope is in my veins
And I swear that I'm okay
Someone take me home

I'll tell you what you want to know
If you see the hole I'm sinking in
I'll tell you what you want to know
If you see the hole I'm sinking

---------------------------------------------------
And when I asked for a separate room
It was late at night, and we'd been driving since noon
But if I'd known how that would sound to you
I would have stayed in your bed for the rest of my life
Just to prove I was right
That it's harder to be friends than lovers
And you shouldn't try to mix the two
'Cause if you do it and you're still unhappy
Then you know that the problem is you
And it's true that I stole your lighter
And it's also true that I lost the map
But when you said that I wasn't worth talking to
I had to take your word on that
But if you'd known how that would sound to me
You would have taken it back
And boxed it up and buried it in the ground
Boxed it up and buried it in the ground
Boxed it up and buried it in the ground
Burned it up and thrown it away
You put in my hands a loaded gun
And then told me not to fire it
When you did the things you said were up to me
And then accused me of trying to fuck it up
But you've never been a waste of my time
It's never been a drag
So take a deep breath and count back from ten
And maybe you'll be alright
And the license said you had to stick around until I was dead
But if you're tired of looking at my face, I guess I already am
But you've never been a waste of my time
It's never been a drag
So take a deep breath and count back from ten
And maybe you'll be alright
---------------------------------------------------
10,000 hours in anything makes you an expert
And I've spent way more time than that frettin' over guys
I've got a B.F.A., an M.F.A., a Ph.D. in obsession
And now I find myself wondering why

I could have used that time to cure leukemia
I could have used that time to clean the seas
I could have taught some teens awareness of bulimia
I could have saved the pandas, whales, and bees

Without love, you can save the world
Put those hours to good use instead
Without love, you can save the world
Sing out, branch out, get out of your own head

Hey, guys!


Peace!


Peace and love!


But not love

Love's a real time suck, it really gets your mind stuck
On things that later on, you'll be like, "why?"
Like when's he gonna text or when will I see him next?


Then suddenly the lakes have all gone dry
And it's all your fault!

Without love, you can save the world


Save the world!


Clear space in your brain for better things


Better things!
Without love, you can save the world (save the world!)
Not being tied to a bed can really give you wings


Conserve your mental energy


To research conserving energy


Don't raise hell


Raise money for local schools


Now that you've got time


Take the leash off your hog


And use that leash to walk rescue dogs


Love is blind


But without love


You can actually help the blind


It's a sexless utopia!
Without love, you can save the world (save the world!)
Forget who you did, think about what you can do (what you can do!)
Without love, you can save the world (save the world!)
Change doesn't start with him, change starts with you
It starts with you!
Not who you screw (not who you screw!)
It starts with you!
Without love
---------------------------------------------------
We used to be kids in the backseat wastin' time
Talkin' bout' high hopes and day dreams
Never thought love never thought life
Could take us far beyond what we believed
As long as I got your love next to me

Better than I used to be

Mmm

I been chasin' this dream
I'm so glad you understand
Climbing up a mountain, would it leave you hardly standing
Things don't go just the way you planned it
But I never thought we'd have, so much to take for granted
You never know what you got till it's gone
Guess I never know cause I know you're my only one

We used to be kids in the backseat wastin' time
Talkin' bout' high hopes and day dreams
Never thought love never thought life
Could take us far beyond what we believed
As long as I got your love next to me

Better than I used to be
Better than I used to be

It's been a long day alone
And I can hardly stand it
My plane leaves tomorrow
But my heart has already landed
Things didn't go, just the way I planned it
But I never thought we'd have, so much to take for granted

You never know what you got till it's gone
Guess I never know cause I know you're my only one
You're only one

We used to be kids in the backseat wastin' time
Talkin' bout' high hopes and day dreams
Never thought love never thought life
Could take us far beyond what we believed
As long as I got your love next to me

Better than I used to be, mmm
Better than I used to be

We used to be kids in the backseat wastin' time
Talkin' bout' high hopes and day dreams
Never thought love never thought life
Could take us far beyond what we believed
As long as I got your love next to me

Better than I used to be
Better than I used to be, oh
Better than I used to be
Better than I used to be
---------------------------------------------------
Little woman
Is it me
Born to build your
Suffering
Are you crazy
Just like me
To let me close
To let me be
The one
Love's a gun
Love's a gun

Pretty baby
Let me know
How to touch you
Where to go
With my fingers
With my tongue
With my anger
Love's a gun
Love's a gun

Little woman
You should know
You're the river
Shines like chrome
Love is loud
Love is long
Love is patient
Love's a song
Love's a song
---------------------------------------------------
Uh huh. Uh huh. Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh

My sperm is nice and healthy
In terms of sperm, I'm wealthy
I'm like Warren Buffett
I got so much of it
That's what my doctors tell me

My point is in a nutshell
Each time I bust, I bust well
I got the quantity
And the quality
No IUD is stoppin' me

'Cause my semen's steamin' like a demon
And all the surrogates be screamin'
Just give me some of that
Premium-grade baby batter
I never splatter
My sperm, my sperm
Is no cause for concern

My sperm is healthy!
My sperm is healthy!
Aw shucks! Gee whiz!
I got the best sperm in the biz
My sperm is healthy!
My sperm is healthy!
My sperm is healthy

Even though I'm no teenager
My boys still throw a rager
They get bottle service
In every cervix
Blowin' eggs up like a pager

Every lady's gettin' fertilized
Got a diaphragm? It's gettin' pulverized
My sperm shines brighter than the sun
So wear special glasses or avert your eyes

Give thanks my tank's not shootin' blanks
I'm in a league of my own, just like Tom Hanks
Not a castaway
But I blast away
That thing I do
Is inseminate you
With my sperm, my sperm
The tests have all confirmed

His sperm is healthy!
His sperm is healthy!

Aw shucks! Gee whiz!
My sperm just aced the quiz
My sperm is healthy!
My sperm is healthy!

My sperm is healthy

I made a couple chips off that stove
I'm a mack and I go pimp all my hoes
I made a couple chips off that road
And I need twenty for a motherfuckin' show

I got a lot of diamonds on me, nigga I'm cool with it
I got a baby nine on me, watch how I move with it
She done fell in love with the whole gang, let the whole crew hit it
I had to show the whole world I was a fool with it
I'll never let my nigga down, nigga I stay with it
I'm on your magazine, young nigga on your TV screen
I heard some niggas that I love tryna change on me
I heard my day one nigga tryna change on me

I made a couple chips off that stove
I'm a mack and I go pimp all my hoes
I made a couple chips off that road
And I need twenty for a motherfuckin' show
Just like B Will I be finessin' all my hoes
Gucci-ed down from my neck to my toe
I wanna give the best to my bro
From the slums, nigga I'll never fold

I kiss and then I diss all my hoes
I fuck and I dismiss all my hoes
I'm drippin' like some piss on my ho
I'm finna go get rich on you hoes
I just copped a 'Vette on you hoes
Don't put up with no mess from you hoes
I know what to expect from you hoes
I took off like a jet on you hoes

I made a couple chips off that stove
I'm a mack and I go pimp all my hoes
I made a couple chips off that road
And I need twenty for a motherfuckin' show
Just like B Will I be finessin' all my hoes
Gucci-ed down from my neck to my toe
I wanna give the best to my bro
From the slums, nigga I'll never fold

Whole lot of money out the hood
I'ma make the shit look good
Came in straight up out the wood
Juggin' with a big four-five
Hit you in you shit four times
I just hit your bitch four times
I ain't even hit four lines
Serve a brick make it re-rock
Whip it and whip it and I make it rock up
I'm straight out the gutter, I tore the whole block up
I'm over the stove, whip it 'til it lock up
They know we shootin' whenever we pop up

I made a couple chips off that stove
I'm a mack and I go pimp all my hoes
I made a couple chips off that road
And I need twenty for a motherfuckin' show
Just like B Will I be finessin' all my hoes
Gucci-ed down from my neck to my toe
I wanna give the best to my bro
From the slums, nigga I'll never fold

I made a couple chips off that stove
I'm a mack and I go pimp all my hoes

Let's ride our lucky star tonight
Never felt so weak and made
Through the door and out of the gate
Where our birthright patiently waits

And I'd be happy to take us there
And we're off

Looked forward for this moment to come
Walking in the same place til today
Killed your ex in a dream
Seems things are looking up for me

You and your knife
Cut through the room
You love me now
So I'll watch my mouth

Assuming I'm right
A few breaths left
Don't leave me now
So ever devout

Let's ride our lucky star tonight
Above all the grey towers
Shivering from our mystic life
As we comb the day-night sky
Don't know where, but I'll take us there

You and your knife
Cut through the room
I love you now
So watch your mouth

Assuming I'm right
A few breaths left
Don't leave me now
So ever devout

You and your knife
Cut through the room
I love you now
So watch your mouth

Assuming I'm right
A few breaths left
Don't leave me now
So ever devout

Waited for this moment to come
No need to push, I'll gladly jump
---------------------------------------------------
He doesn't fight crime or wear a cape
He doesn't read minds or levitate
But every time my world needs saving, he's my superman
Some folks don't believe in heroes 'cause they haven't met my dad

He loves his workshop and rock and roll
He's got a hot rod and a heart of gold
And you could say he's a man of few words, but he talks a lot within
And even though I'm a little taller, I still look up to him

He built me a house in the arms of a tree
He taught me to drive, and to fight, and to dream
When he looks in my eyes I hope he can see
That my dad's a hero to me

Rust-ridden fenders, and doors full of dings
Somehow he can fix about anything
I didn't think he knew how to cry till our dog died that year
He doesn't always say I love you, but I can hear him loud and clear

He built me a house in the arms of a tree
He taught me to drive, and to fight, and to dream
When he looks in my eyes I hope he can see
That my dad's a hero to me

He built me a house in the arms of a tree
He taught me to drive, and to fight, and to dream
When he looks in my eyes I hope he can see
That my dad's a hero to me

My dad's a hero to me
My dad's a hero to me
---------------------------------------------------
Tempted by something I can't describe
I'll dig deeper
Like a moth caught in a web
It's becoming clearer
That I'm not the boy I once was
So I'll seek the truth
I speak, I see
And I hear you

Evil, evil like you
Evil, evil like you
Evil, evil like you

Seduced by the whispers
Coming straight from your soft lips
Rapid waves crashing through
Sinking my ships
This entity
Is leaving me so blue
I speak, I see
And I hear you

Evil, evil like you
Evil, evil like you
Evil, evil like you

Evil, evil like you
Evil, evil like you
Evil, evil like
---------------------------------------------------
Hey there lonely one
Did you think that you would die alone?
I don't think you want to know
Hey there lonely one
When you try to leave the world this way
You're not the only one that goes

But you say so long
'Cause you're too far gone to waste away
Long enough to call home

Stealing life's a way to go alone
Stealing life's a way to move along
'Cause you're too far gone
You won't be there to help us carry on

Bye bye lonely one
What was it that you wanted to say?
You've gone and thrown your voice away
And now the lonely one
I wish he'd read the notes inside his head
I don't think I'd want to know

'Cause you say so long
'Cause you're too far gone to waste away
Long enough to call home

Stealing life's a way to go alone
Stealing life's a way to move along
'Cause you're too far gone
You won't be there to help us carry on

Bye bye lonely one
What was it that you wanted to say
Waste away
Long enough to call home

Stealing life's a way to carry on
Stealing life's a way to go alone
Stealing life's a way to move along
'Cause you're too far gone
You won't be there to help us carry on
To help us carry on
To help us carry on

You are too far gone to help us carry on
You are too far gone to help us carry on
You are too far gone to help us carry on
---------------------------------------------------
Can we talk in the morning?
I'm no use tired and upset
Oh, just leave it out for the morning
It'll sleep fine in our bed

I don't wanna think about it
Don't wanna empathize
It's too late at night

We always said we shouldn't talk like this
You're frustrated, we should sleep on it
And a stubborn mind should learn to quit while it's ahead
And I can tell I hit a nerve with you
That's what talking late at night will do
Taking turns for the worse

I can say anything I mean
When it's past midnight and I've been drinking
Oh, and we'll just get mad and emotional
If we try to face it when we should be sleeping

I don't wanna think about it
Don't wanna empathize
It's too late at night

We always said we shouldn't talk like this
You're frustrated, we should sleep on it
And a stubborn mind should learn to quit while it's ahead
And I can tell I hit a nerve with you
That's what talking late at night will do
Taking turns for the worse

We always said we shouldn't talk like this
You're frustrated, we should sleep on it
And a stubborn mind should learn to quit while it's ahead
And I can tell I hit a nerve with you
That's what talking late at night will do
Taking turns for the worse
Taking turns for the worse
---------------------------------------------------
I've been waiting on a thrill
To touch your skin and feel you in
Bewitched by your body
This can kill and make you sin

Don't let absence get you down
Don't let absence make you mess around

Then she started to think and started to cry
All alone in our bed just to get through the night
But lonely girl you're still mine
Lonely girl we've got the time
If it's enough to keep your mind
We got nothing to lose

You've been waiting on a call
To hear my words to let me in
But only me
Just let me in
Just let me in

Then she started to think and started to cry
All alone in our bed just to get through the night
But lonely girl you're still mine
Lonely girl we've got the time
If it's enough to keep your mind
We got nothing to lose

Moments lost but not the faith in them
Impunity can overwhelm
Moments but not the faith in them

Then she started to think and started to cry
All alone in our bed just to get through the night
But lonely girl you're still mine
Lonely girl we've got the time
If it's enough to keep your mind
We got nothing to lose
---------------------------------------------------
Lost in the time, in the way
Gone but not forgotten
New secret crimes to repay
Now the walls have fallen

And so it's now or never

I'm breathing in
I'm breathing out
I'll cut the ties
That hold me down

I'm breathing in
I'm breathing out
I'll be the enemy

Caught, quicksand grip pull me in
Whisper faith in sickness
Soon kill the myth, I'll begin
Be the first to witness

And so it's now or never

I'm breathing in
I'm breathing out
I'll cut the ties
That hold me down

I'm breathing in
I'm breathing out
I'll be the enemy

I'm breathing in
I'm breathing out
I'll cut the ties
That hold me down

I'm breathing in
I'm breathing out

I'm breathing in
I'm breathing out
I'll be the enemy
---------------------------------------------------
Now I got bloodstains
I get a kick I can't explain
Your love's so bitter but I like the taste
Your love's so bitter but it's sweet that way

Hold me like a fever
No, I'll never leave ya
Lie and I believe every word
Baby you're a devil
Burning me in heaven
There's pleasure in the pain but it hurts

It's kinda love and it's kind of a war
These kinda laws never cut me before

And now I got bloodstains
I get a kick I can't explain
Your love's so bitter but I like the taste
Your love's so bitter but it's sweet that way

(Your love's so beautiful)
(Your love's so beautiful)
(Your love's so beautiful)

Maybe I'm defenseless
Maybe it's a death wish
But tell me, tell me what can I do
'Cause when you smile you look so harmless
But girl you can be so heartless
And I'm caught up in the darkness with you

It's kinda love and it's kind of a war
These kinda laws never cut me before

And now I got bloodstains
I get a kick I can't explain
Your love's so bitter but I like the taste
Your love's so bitter but it's sweet that way

(Your love's so beautiful)
(Your love's so beautiful)

So pick me up, throw me down
Put me back to pieces
Pick me up, throw me down
Love me then repeat it
So pick me up, throw me down
Put me back to pieces
Pick me up, throw me down

Now I got bloodstains
But I get a kick I can't explain
Your love's so bitter but I like the taste
Your love's so bitter but it's sweet that way
Your love's so bitter but I like the taste
Your love's so bitter but it's sweet that way
It's sweet that way

(Your love's so beautiful)
(Your love's so beautiful)
(Your love's so beauti-)
---------------------------------------------------
Juicy

I know I'm being pathetic and it's all in my head
I'm sure I made up everything I think you've said
But no nothing matters when you open your mouth
I fall harder for every word that comes out

I'd cross oceans if that could be done
I'll move mountains if that's what you want
Why don't you believe me?
I know that you need me

Why?
Why?

It's unexpected, but you see
I haven't told you every move you made put fire in me
So here goes nothing and all that I've got
I'm standing up and asking you to give me a shot

I'd cross oceans if that could be done
I'll move mountains if that's what you want
Why don't you believe me?
I know that you need me

Why?
I'd cross oceans if that could be done
Why?

I'd cross oceans if that could be done
I'll move mountains if that's what you want
Why don't you believe me?
I know that you need me

Why?
I'd cross oceans
I'd cross oceans if that could be done

Free as a highway
Wild as the wind
I can hear her callin' my name
Callin' me home again

Wide open spaces
Cool mountain breezes
Reachin' down to save my soul
Take these city blues away
The closest thing to heaven that you'll find
Headin' for the big sky

Won't you come with me
We'll find a reason
Reason to believe again
There's still a paradise
The closest thing to heaven that you'll find
Headin' for the big sky

It seems like all we do is talk
Bout the lives people walk away from
Let's pack the car and leave tonight
Drive until the city lights fade, fade, fade
Let 'em fade away

Wide open spaces
Cool mountain breezes
Reachin' down to save my soul
Take these city blues away
The closest thing to heaven that you'll find
Headin' for the big sky
The closest thing to heaven that you'll find

Big sky
Big sky
Big sky

Fue
La relacion mas dolorosa
Pero tambien Fue
Inolvidable

Cada lugar
Cada momento
Cada encuentro Fue
Especial

Fue
Y aunque ya no es
Te extrano no importa
Si me hiciste dano

Creo que volveria
Si me lo pidieras
Yo creo que si..

Fue
Los dos sabemos lo que Fue
Y esta cancion es
No lo se

Pero no te olvidare..

Te imagino en otros brazos
Y me duele
Tu no te imaginas cuanto
Es que me duele

Te quisiera preguntar
Si en verdad te da lo mismo
No saber de mi
Jamas

¿Quien sera tu nuevo amor?
A caso te hace feliz
Porque a mi nadie me hizo
Por mas veces que intente

Demostrar que si podia vivir sin ti
Fracase..

Fue

Chillin' with you day and night
And I'm enjoyin' most this time that we're spendin' together
But remember when yeah you and I
Agreed that we just want some fun
And we don't want to be forever

You say nothing's changed but you don't act the same
You keep tellin' me what I can and cannot do
So won't you please start telling me the truth
Cause it's stoppin' me and you, I-

So when will you start to hear my voice speak
So I can say what's on my mind
Oh no, no, no, no you don't want to listen to me
Cause you're scared that I might be right

So you don't wanna talk no more
What you actin' like a fool for?
I still want things goin' on
Just don't want a relationship
Cause Imma go and quit that shit
That ain't fair on you now is it?
At least I'm tryna be legit, I'm being straight with you don't flip

Not gon' take no more of this
You cry every time we go out on a place
Why do you cry over this
What did I miss
I'm not taking a piss
No with you my mistress
Well that ain't what we agreed
Why you tryna make me feel guilty?
I don't

So when will you start to hear my voice speak
So I can say what's on my mind
Oh no, no, no, no you don't want to listen to me
Cause you're scared that I might be right

Said I don't wanna do this no more
No, no, no, no yeah
Said well we got far too serious, yeah

Why can't things stay as they were
Why do you have to cry over
Situations that are minor
We both agreed not to get serious

Why can't things stay as they were
Why do you have to cry over
Situations that are minor
We both agreed not to get serious

When-when will-will you-you start to hear my voice speak babe
So I can say what's on my mind
Oh no, no, no, yeah we've got far too serious, yeah yeah!
Far too serious
Far too serious
Far too serious, oh-oh

Why can't things stay as they were
Why do you have to cry over
Situations that are minor
We both agreed not to get serious
---------------------------------------------------
It's not the way that you walk that gets me off
It's the way that you think
It's the way that you talk
And when I see something I like you know that I gotta pounce
All the things that you say, say, say
I can trust every ounce

But I can't tell this girl what's on my mind
And it seems it's getting closer all the time (ooh, girl)
I said, I can't tell this girl what's on my mind (oh no, baby)
And it seems it's getting closer all the time

'Cause I went to a party and I left my pretty baby with Ralphie
Baby and now I'm alone
Was doing much better when you weren't here
And now I'm feeling something and I know she's doing better without me, maybe
I guess I'll go home whether that's with or without you

Ooh, and I know that it's too hard
For you to play it back from the start
And no, I don't know your name
Or the frame of your mind

But I can't tell this girl what's on my mind (ooh, baby)
And it seems it's getting closer all the time (ooh, girl)
I said, I can't tell this girl what's on my mind (oh no, baby)
'Cause it seems it's getting closer all the time

'Cause I went to a party and I left my pretty baby with Ralphie
Baby and now I'm alone
Was doing much better when you weren't here
And now I'm feeling something and I know she's doing better without me, maybe
I guess I'll go home whether that's with or without you
---------------------------------------------------
If I want to restart us
Can we go right now
Loose our flaws and harness
And we don't look down

Watching the waves I
Wait for the tide to run out

Forget my body
Send me some piece of mind
I'll hold my hands up
If you lay to rest your fire

Give me your reasons
I'll take away the meaning

Oh, and I'm telling you this feels like

It's like I'm running under, running underwater
It's like I'm running under, running underwater with you
It's like I'm running under, running underwater
It's like I'm running under, running underwater with you

If I want to break paths
Can we leave right now
Keep my ego guarded
And never let me down

Tell me you're leaving
Tell me you've changed your mind
Oh now we're talking about love in the midnight

It's like I'm running under, running underwater
It's like I'm running under, running underwater with you
It's like I'm running under, running underwater
It's like I'm running under, running underwater with you

And I, just need some piece of mind
You, find it tiring
Tell me, where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?

It's like I'm running under, running underwater
It's like I'm running under, running underwater with you
It's like I'm running under, running underwater
It's like I'm running under, running underwater with you

Ninguna resiste mi verbo
Mi habilidad es empirica
Relajate y deja los nervios
Y solo vacila la lirica

A su novio le pone los cuernos
Pero dice que ella no es la tipica
Van a parar al infierno
Pero vale verga asi que chinga ya
Es mi perra negro mirala
Pero no me la vaya a tocar
Que la vaina ajena se respeta de pequeno me lo enseno mi mama

A mi no me importa si roba, si mata, si vende, si fuma o si huele
Yo solo quiero papeles
Y una morra que lo pele
Que pegue el culo del piso, cuando el puto ritmo suene
Y que juegue con mi pene
Esa mierda me entretiene

Leal con los mios, por nada me vendo

---------------------------------------------------
The more I live the more I love
Faces, hearts and words
The way the sunlight plays upon
The trees, the sky, the birds
The more you know the more you'll grow
Knowledge is power still
Classroom, wartime factories
The coal mines and the mills

When starry eyes and radio skies
Were the peaks of my concern
It was off of the gas into the turn
Right on the edge, two wheels on the ledge
I'm searching for that girl
Madly in love at the end of the world

The less I pay attention to
The news, the hype, the feed
The less I buy into all of
The lies, the hate, the greed
The more I sing, the more I feel
Love, hope and soul
The more I dive into your world
The more I come out whole

When sunny skies and smoky eyes
Were the peaks of my concern
It was off of the gas into the turn
White broken lines, sign after sign
I'm crazy for that girl
Madly in love at the end of the world
End of the world

A cold wind blows, I'm deep in dream
The ship is going down
The captain's wheel is in the hands
Of a barker and a clown
I hold on tight, no land in sight
Waves crash over the bow
We've come here on these different ships
We're in the same boat now

When firefights and sleepless nights
Were the least of my concerns
I would roll on the gas out of the turns
No doubt, no fear, the end is near
I'm gunning for that girl
Madly in love at the end of the world
The end of the world
---------------------------------------------------
She's one of those girls who seems to come in the spring
One look in her eyes and you forget everything
You had ready to say
And I saw her today, yeah

A younger girl keeps a-rollin' 'cross my mind
No matter how much I try, I can't seem to leave her memory behind

I remember her eyes, soft, dark, and brown
Said she'd never been in trouble, even in the town

A younger girl keeps a-rollin' 'cross my mind
No matter how much I try, I can't seem to leave her memory behind

A younger girl keeps a-rollin' 'cross my mind
And should I hang around, acting like her brother
In a few more years, they'd call us right for each other
And why?
If I wait I'll just die, yeah

A younger girl keeps a-rollin' 'cross my mind
No matter how much I try, I can't seem to leave her memory behind

I remember her eyes, soft, dark, and brown
Said she'd never been in trouble, even in the town

A younger girl keeps a-rollin' 'cross my mind

She's one of those girls who seems to come in the spring
One look in her eyes and you forget everything
---------------------------------------------------
There's something special about six o'clock
In the morning when it's still too early to knock.
And the dusty light shines down on the block
And reflects up and down on the hands of the clock.
Six o'clock, six o'clock.

A few hours ago she was standing here
Just watching the stars in our eyes
and the lights as uptights disappear.
And I could feel I could say what I want
That I could nudge her and call her my confidante
And now I'm back alone with just my shadow in front.
Six o'clock, six o'clock.

I went home and found that trying to sleep was a laugh
Just watching my eyelids knowing my brain bids the night not to pass.
I got up and got to scuffling around
But somehow it just wasn't the same happy town
And the bells didn't ring with the same happy sound.
Six o'clock, six o'clock.

If I go back where we parted
Could I ever be like that again?
Guess I'll just have to wait 'til tomorrow
But what can I do 'til then?

Guess I'll go back home and just wait until dawn
Guess I had to learn going back where we were wouldn't help at all.
And I wish my head had been working right
We'd have gone for coffee and talked all night.
But now I'm back alone feelin'twisted up tight.
Six o'clock, six o'clock.

Now I'm back alone...
Yes, now I'm back alone...
I'm back alone
---------------------------------------------------
It's a little blurry how the whole thing started
I don't even really know what you intended
Thought that you were cute and you could make me jealous
Poured it down, so I poured it down
Next thing that I know I'm in a hotel with you
You were talking deep like it was mad love to you
You wanted my heart but I just liked your tattoos
Poured it down, so I poured it down

And now I don't understand it
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth
And I know I shouldn't say it
But my heart don't understand

Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
And my heart don't understand
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind

Now I always hear, always hear them talking
Talking 'bout a boy, 'bout a boy with my name
Saying that I hurt you but I still don't get it
You didn't love me, no, not really
Wait, I could have really liked you
I'll bet, I'll bet that's why I keep on thinking 'bout you
It's a shame, you said I was good
So I poured it down, so I poured it down

And now I don't understand it
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth
And I know I shouldn't say it
But my heart don't understand

Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
And my heart don't understand
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind

You got yourself in a dangerous zone
Cause we both have the fear, fear of being alone

And I still don't understand it
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth
And my heart don't understand it, understand it, understand it

Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
And my heart don't understand
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
---------------------------------------------------
Don't, don't keep me
Don't keep me safe
I need you, I need you
I need you to stop handling me

I see you thinking
Eyes closed, you're missing it
And I'm done pretending
It's all good
I'm not too fragile to touch
I don't need your kid gloves

Watch your mouth
And choose your words
I'm not the fragile bird
That used to show up on your doorstep
'Cause I've grown up
And I found words
How I wanna think, how I wanna feel
What I wanna say, when I wanna leave

I see you thinking
Eyes closed, you're missing it
And I'm done pretending
It's all good
I'm not too fragile to touch
I don't need your kid gloves
I'm not too fragile to touch
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not

I see you thinking
Eyes closed, you're missing it
And I'm done pretending
It's all good
I'm not too fragile to touch
I don't need your kid gloves
Oh, I'm not too fragile to touch
I don't need your kid gloves
Oh, I'm not too fragile to touch
I don't need your kid gloves
---------------------------------------------------
I hate everyone that I meet
But I'm getting better
Think before I speak because I
I know I've got a temper

Think I've blown a fuse
There's blood on my knuckles
The smile on my face is fake
And the vein on my head suggests you get running

I've had enough, had enough
Had enough, had enough yeah
Cause I've had enough
I think I'm reaching the limit
You should keep your distance
Cause I've had enough

Take a deep breath and count to three
And then I'll be behavin'
I feel like people just don't get me
Maybe I'm crazy

Think I've blown a fuse
There's blood on my knuckles
The smile on my face is fake
And the vein on my head suggests you get running

I've had enough, had enough
Had enough, had enough yeah
Cause I've had enough
I think I'm reaching the limit
You should keep your distance
Cause I've had enough

Well I guess it could be me
Quite possibly
I might be scared or insecure
I have been here before, the blame ain't yours
But the vein on my head suggests you get running

Had enough, had enough yeah
Cause I've had enough
I think I'm reaching the limit
You should keep your distance
Cause I've had enough

Hey now, don't you know
I said hey now, don't you know, know
Cause I've had enough
Hey now, don't you know
I said hey now, don't you know, know
I've had enough
---------------------------------------------------
I just wanna lay here
And smoke my cig
And drink my wine
I think I'm gonna lay here
Until my hurting is done
I just wanna lay here
And smoke my cig
And drink my wine
I think I'm gonna lay here
Until my hurting is done

Confio facilmente en la gente
Y por eso ya no tengo nada mas pa' darme fuerte
Estoy cansada y mis huesos se sienten viejos
Creeme, ya no tengo nada porque todo te lo dejo
Y yo, asi pasando
Y con mi dudas fumo mas, sigo cantando
Como que se que otra vez el sol va a subir
Pero no quiero ver manana si es sin ti

I just wanna lay here
And smoke my cig
And drink my wine
I think I'm gonna lay here
Until my hurting is done
I just wanna lay here
And smoke my cig
And drink my wine
I think I'm gonna lay here
Until my hurting is done

I should've never let you in
I should've never let you win, huh
I should've never let you in
Cause now I'm sitting here
Crying like a fool
And all the world has seen my pain
You know I love you all the same
I hope in time my heart will change
Cause now I'm sitting here crying like a...

I just wanna lay here
And smoke my cig
And drink my wine
I think I'm gonna lay here
Until my hurting is done
I just wanna lay here
And smoke my cig
And drink my wine
I think I'm gonna lay here
Until my hurting is done

(Light scatting underneath)
And I sit in this haze, babe
Until I'm seeing the sun
And I sit and I fade, babe
Until I'm seeing the sun
And I sit in this haze, babe
Until I'm seeing the sun
And I sit and I fade, babe
Until I'm seeing the sun
---------------------------------------------------
It's come to this, like I knew it would
Since I'm now single for good
I know just what I gotta do
I gotta go get myself a buttload of cats


A buttload of cats!


A buttload of cats


Way too many cats


When you're a permanent bachelorette
It's mandatory that you go out and get
A buttload of cats
Oh, yeah!

I walk myself down to the lonely lady cat store
The smell is overwhelming inside
This is the future smell of my house
It's the smell of my dreams that have died

I walk up to the cat shelf
Where the cats are labeled big and small
The saleslady asks, "is there one you like?"
And I state, "I'll take them all!"
I want a buttload of cats


Meow, a buttload of cats


Give me a buttload of cats


Meow, a buttload of cats
Meow


The saleslady's pumped, she's closin' early
And headed home to her sad walk-up apartment
Filled with her own buttload of cats


Meow meow meow


That she got at a discount


Meow meow meow


'Cause she works at the cat store


Meow meow meow
Meow meow meow
Meow meow meow meow meow

Why have cats over time become
Synonymous with loneliness?
We gotta work on our collective image
We need a new publicist
The ironic part is, we're not that friendly
If you're lonely, we might make it worse
Also, we sleep, like, sixteen hours a day
Have you considered getting a dog?


Nope, I want a buttload of you guys


Okay, we warned you


A buttload of cats!


We're gonna ruin your couch


There's a lot of evidence that organisms in cat poop make you crazy


Yes, we saw that article in the Atlantic. And then we peed on the Atlantic


But I still want a buttload of cats
---------------------------------------------------

And I remember when we were fuckin'
Now I'm writin' love songs about how we were
And I ever knew that that was something yeah
Then maybe I'd sing these words to you girl and

I never thought that we
Had something special like ice and tea
Compatible despite their ethnicity
And differences they were meant to be
That tastes so sweet lemon and peach
I'm so sorry I did not believe in us

I keep on thinkin' about what we had and how stupid I've been Fucking drama queen always overthinking
When I should've been listenin' to what's true
I pursued something new
Whether you would find it so difficult to do
I stopped myself from falling in two
Love with someone so beautiful, someone beautiful aah

And I remember when we were fuckin'
And now I'm writin' love songs about how we were once
And if I ever knew that was something yeah
Then maybe I'd sing these words to you girl and-

Looking back I realize, I had something that these other guys
Would never get in their life and I took you for granted
I apologize
I didn't know what I had until it was gone
Cause my mind was still young
But I'm grateful for your love
Cause now I know at least there's one
You can fall in love with, care for and see the world with
And I don't even know why I did it
Why'd I let you go?
Drink smoke and dine with, laugh, joke, and share a life with
And I don't even know why I did it
Why'd I let you go?

And I remember when we were fuckin' oh
And now I'm writin' love songs about how we were once
And if I ever knew that was something oh I
Then maybe I'd sing these words to you girl and-

Since you and I
I've struggled to find anything that I like
We had something special
I'm sorry that I couldn't see that now
I was naive at the time other things on my mind
Seeking reason, what is the meaning
This life is deceiving
Yeah, I know that we weren't perfect
But if it's easy it's fucking not worth it

And well I remember when we were fuckin' oh
And now I'm writin' love songs about how we were once
And well if I ever knew that was something oh
Then maybe I would sing these words to you my love

And well I remember when we were fuckin' oh
And now I'm writin' love songs about how we were once
If I ever knew that that was something oh
Then maybe I'll sing these words maybe I'll sing

So how you doing anyway?
You okay are you keeping safe?
I heard you're getting engaged to somebody that's better than me
Well, how you doing anyway?
Are you okay are you keeping safe?
I heard you're getting engaged to somebody that's better than me
---------------------------------------------------
Make me hate to love, make me hate to love
Make me hate to love, make me hate to love
Make me take the drugs, oh no, take the drugs, oh n-


Make me hate to love, make me hate to love
Swear I open up, but you ain't the one
But you left me here, why you bring me here?
Why the change of plans? We all selfish
I said, "I hate to love but I love the drugs
'Cause they make me numb, help me function"
And this all stemmin' from things, you set it off

Guess I'm better off


I feel like I need you
The way you talk, the way you move
All the things you do, all the things you do
They make me feel crazy, I question myself
Don't want nothing else but all the things you do
You make it hard, you make it hard, I make it easy

Hate to love, hate to love, hate to love, hate to love
Hate to love, hate to love, hate to love, hate to love (you make it hard)
Hate to love, hate to love, hate to love, hate to love (I make it easy)
Hate to love, hate to love, hate to love, hate to love (you make it hard, I make it easy)


I said, "hate to love", you can't blame me
For the fact that you made me a monster
Told you that you could have my baby
At this point, I'ma take back that offer, unh
Always argue, get you started, it
Drive me crazy, get my car keys, aye
Ain't no talkin', no, I try to walk away
Put hands in my face, bitch get off me
No, I don't want it, you ungrateful
What you thinkin'? All them payments, yea
All them flights home, you brought that baggage
I still accept you, you turn me savage
I'd like to thank you, left me heartless
Now I lean, duck, dodge, my guard up
I can't afford it, I fuckin' skate
Now Mr. Heartbreak like 808


I feel like I need you
The way you talk, the way you move
All the things you do, all the things you do
They make me feel crazy, I question myself
Don't want nothing else but all the things you do
You make it hard, you make it hard, I make it easy

Hate to love, hate to love, hate to love, hate to love
Hate to love, hate to love, hate to love, hate to love (you make it hard)
Hate to love, hate to love, hate to love, hate to love (I make it easy)
Hate to love, hate to love, hate to love, hate to love (you make it hard, I make it easy)
Hate to love, hate to love, hate to love, hate to love
Hate to love, hate to love, hate to love, hate to love (you make it hard)

This session
Is going to be different
It's going to be so different
I know...

This patient
Won't be indifferent
This time around
She'll want to grow...

I've been burned
So many times
By the girl who's committed
So many burn crimes

Yet I never
Lost hope or endurance
Thank God I don't
Accept health insurance

I charge 250 dollars an hour now

This session is gonna be useful
If she's truthful about how she feels

So I'll give it my all
With my requisite therapy shawl
Kiss my fancy degrees on the wall
For good luck

That it's gonna be different
I can help her be different
Sweet Jesus, it has to be different

Cause if it's not
I frickin' quit!

My love, My love, My love
(My lover, My lover)
---------------------------------------------------
I think we stopped somewhere along
Just motions memorized and we're left twisting our tongues
We still make love but it's tearing us apart
When movement stops, we're strangers lying in the dark

And I don't wanna get by, get by, get by with you
I don't wanna get high to paralyze my mind
Distract ourselves into thinking we make sense
Distract ourselves into thinking we make sense
Thinking we make sense
Thinking we make

We're both too tired, can't break the quiet
Too scared to recognize how estranged we've become

And I don't wanna get by, get by, get by with you
I don't wanna get high to paralyze my mind
Distract ourselves into thinking we make sense
Distract ourselves into thinking we make sense
Distract ourselves into thinking we make sense
Distract ourselves into thinking we make sense
Thinking we make sense
Thinking we make

And I don't wanna get by, get by, get by with you
I don't wanna get high to paralyze my mind
And I don't wanna get by, get by, get by with you
I don't wanna get high to paralyze my mind
Distract ourselves into thinking we make sense
Distract ourselves into thinking we make sense
Distract ourselves into thinking we make sense
Distract ourselves into thinking we make sense
Thinking we make sense
Thinking we make

Oh, just one more for the road
Oh, just one more for the road
This world can be so cold
Before I let you go
Just one more for the road

Oh, I've seen it coming slow
Oh, I've seen it coming slow
The whistle blowing low
Our wishes push and pull
Just one more for the road

Oh, the moon is barely full
Oh, the moon is barely full
Be still my heart and soul
Our long lost rock and roll
Just one more for the road

Oh, just one more for the road
Oh, just one more for the road
This world can be so cold
Before I let you go
Just one more for the road

New chapter, new page
Made some money off the first mixtape
Now I'm livin' good, chillin' by a beach that's not a lake
Said the Earth controls the Moon, so we control the waves
So let me say that shit again, hope they listen to what I'm sayin'
While that blood flow through you, please don't live your life in vain
And if I get better with age, but all my visions ancient
Then we could freeze time to see these pictures that we painted
They release a little bit of dopamine and inspiration
Damn, what a sensation, keep it Ben Franklin, you can get it too
Life been like a dream lately, that's 'cause I'm livin' lucid
And you control your world, swear I'm livin' proof
And I remember In Living Color on in the livin' room
Damn, I miss my mother, now we at them parties you can't get into
Makin' bitches kiss each other, damn, what you finna do?
Look up in the stars and make your problems seem minuscule, like...

What makes us love? What makes us dream?
I found the light, now it's all I see
So we ride that wave (that wave), when that tide comes in
And that water deep, so be prepared to swim
Be prepared to swim, so be prepared to swim
So be prepared to swim, the mind's receptive
You can catch a signal, 'cause waves ripple if you pay attention

See this that deep water, tread lightly
Got good karma and some clean chakras, a clear psyche
I can see everything comin' to me like, "Oh my goodness"
I see world tours, fast cars and big booties
But I'm just focused on my contribution, my contribution
And if I die tonight, just promise me that you'll listen to it
I put my heart and now my soul in it, this shit weighted
And if I try to live forever, will someone save me?
Look, I'm a hustler by trade, an artist by night and dreamer by day
But these days I can't tell the difference soon as I wake
And I say that because, yeah, I know that somethin' awaits
And the rest of the gang straight, look how far we done came

What makes us love? What makes us dream?
I found the light, now it's all I see
So we ride that wave when that tide comes in
And that water deep, so be prepared to swim
Be prepared to swim, so be prepared to swim
So be prepared to swim, so be prepared to swim
So be to, so be, so
---------------------------------------------------
We don't need your money, no, to get by
Don't need the high life
Wake up, get dressed, what the weather says
Look at me, I'm so blessed
You know I got things to do
But can you wait a day or two?
We don't need your money, no, to get by
Don't need the high life

Said I'm way too young to know my mind
And I ain't seen nothing yet
But I just wanna enjoy my time
Let's forget about the rest

Let me be, yeah
Won't you let me be seventeen?
Let me be, yeah
Won't you let me be seventeen?

We got our own way of doing things, queens and kings
Sunrise, midnight, my battery died
But I got no need to check the time
'Cause I got no place to be
No, nobody is waiting on, waiting on me
We got our own way of doing things, queens and kings

Said I'm way too young to know my mind (They say I'm way too young)
And I ain't seen nothing yet (Ain't seen nothing yet)
But I just wanna enjoy my time (Enjoy my time)
Let's forget about the rest (Forget about the rest)

Let me be, yeah
Won't you let me be seventeen?
Let me be, yeah
Won't you let me be seventeen?

Sometimes I wonder where the time goes
Sometimes I wonder, yeah, yeah, I wonder
Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever know
Sometimes I wonder, yeah, yeah, I wonder

If you let me be
Won't you let me be seventeen?
Let me be, let me be
Let me be seventeen
Won't you let me be, let me be
Let me be seventeen?

Oh, you gotta let me be, let me be
Let me be seventeen

One!


Two!


One, two, three, four!


We know what people think when we see us


That we're so hot, it's insane


Ane! Ane! Ane!


When we exit a pool, we do it in slow-motion


But that don't mean we can't complain


'Cause fit hot guys have problems, too
Don't look at us, we're not dancing for you
This is our quiet personal time to reflect
(Flect! Flect! Flect! Flect!)

We have almost no body fat
But we're too bummed out to talk about that
I know we look so much better than you
But fit hot guys have problems, too
Uh!


Everyone is at our sexual mercy
Be them a mister


Or miss


Miss! Miss! Miss!


But when we're down on our knees


No one has sympathy


Because they only see this
And this and this and this and this and this
But what about this?

'Cause fit hot guys have problems, too
Don't look at us, we're not dancing for you
It's just hard to process emotions with our clothes on
(Clothes on! Clothes on! Clothes on!)

Our pecs are perfect, but we have bad days
So don't objectify us with your male and female gaze
We have childhood traumas just like you
'Cause fit hot guys have problems, too
Uh!


Give us back our shirts, you monsters!


Yeah, what is wrong with you?


Come on, guys!


Uh, Josh?


No!


Are you actually here? Like, in reality?


Yeah, this is my new job. I'm a go-go dancer at this club


That's what you meant by volunteer fireman. Okay, got it


You wanna join our imaginary song and dance?


Sure


'Cause fit hot guys have problems, too
Don't look at us, we're not dancing for you
Leave us alone, because we have to twerk out our sad
(Sad! Sad! Sad! Sad! Sad! Sad! Sad! Sad!)

We're expressing our pain through the art of dance
But we'll express so much better without these pants
There's so much pressure when you're a fit hot guy
So just let us ugly cry! Let us ugly cry!
---------------------------------------------------
God is not a contract or a guy
God is an unspecified tide
You cannot time its tables
It sets no glass or gables
God is a lusty tire fire
Its bristles scrape and strike the stage
A rock, paper, scissors' rage
Have mercy on the natural world

My voice is not the liquid waves
The perfect rings around a heron's legs
My voice is straight garroting wire
A stolen mile of fingerprints
Peeled the quiet from the dunes
Captured and re-spooled as ruin to be used
At a different time

My voice is a fracture
For shinbone's lust
Pounding barefoot ground
It lifts you up and sits you just
Just at sorrow's waterline
I drape you on tomorrow's plate
Fair as metal, marrow spilling
Not yours but mine
I'm an agent of the natural world

Don't you tell me I didn't warn you
That that's some gravity you ought not to play with
Don't you tell me I didn't warn you
That that's some gravity you ought not to play with

Nothing quite so poison as a promise
Nothing quite so poison as a promise
Nothing quite so poison as a promise
Nothing quite so poison as a promise

And me, I am not a mess
I am a wilderness, yes
The undiscovered continent for you to undress
But you'll not be my master
You're barely my guest
You don't have permission to take any pictures
Be careful of the natural world

Nature can't amend its ways
Boils along and then replays
Despite heartfelt springtimes of regret
The storms she still cries for days
Have mercy on the natural world

Putas, drogas y carro'
Haciendo trompos en el barro
Fumando en el escenario
Pero sin ti nada me divierte

Oyeme, escuchame
Si no estoy contigo nada me sabe bien
Me seco las lagrima' con billetes de cien
No tengo ningun sueno si no estas en el
Oyeme, escuchame
Si no estoy contigo nada me sabe bien
Me seco las lagrima' con billetes de cien
No tengo ningun sueno si no estas en el, oh

¿De que me sirve estar siempre colocado?
Baby, si ahora ya no te tengo a mi lado
¿Para que el dinero si tu me has dejado?
¿Para que que me recuerden si me has olvidado? tu
Ninguna de las demas me lo hacen como lo hacias tu-uh-uh
Y si me muero meteme algo tuyo en el atau'
Antes todo era igual de oscuro pero me dabas luz
Y ahora desde que te has ido noto el peso de la cru'
Dormia con tu cabeza en mi pecho como Vick VapoRub
Y ahora el hueco de tu cama, mami, me hace perder el flush

Oyeme, escuchame
Si no estoy contigo nada me sabe bien
Me seco las lagrima' con billetes de cien
No tengo ningun sueno si no estas en el
Oyeme, escuchame
Si no estoy contigo nada me sabe bien
Me seco las lagrima' con billetes de cien
No tengo ningun sueno si no estas en el

Desde que te fuiste ya no pienso en otra cosa
En mis tripa' solo mi alma, y hay mariposa'
Yo solo queria ser tu puto y tu mi esposa
Y ahora me arrepiento pero esa ya no importa, noo
Ahora solo me rodeo de mierda, problemas y dope
Ninguna me rula como tu me rulabas el porro-oh-oh
Me lloran los ojos de rezarte como mirando al so'-oh-oh
Y acabo drogado como siempre metido en mi habitacion

Me lloran los ojos de rezarte como mirando al sol-oh-oh
Y acabo drogado como siempre yo, fuck

Oyeme, escuchame
Si no estoy contigo nada me sabe bien
Me seco las lagrima' con billetes de cien
No tengo ningun sueno si no estas en el
Oyeme, escuchame
Si no estoy contigo nada me sabe bien
Me seco las lagrima' con billetes de cien
No tengo ningun sueno si no estas en el

Qu'est-ce tu crois ? Pour arriver on a charbonne
Comme si c'que j'avais j'l'avais pas merite
M'en veut pas, oui c'est Dieu qui m'a donne
Ton poto sur, t'la mets sous ton nez
Tu m'te-ma comme si j't'avais vole
Monte le son, histoire de s'evader


Mais pourquoi tu m'en veux, c'est Dieu qui m'a donne
J'suis desole mais, faut pas jalouser
J'ai fait comme ma daronne, eh ouais j'ai charbonne
Oh la la, la j'suis fatigue
Wesh la famille, on dit quoi ?
Tu jactes sur mon dos, tous les mois, mais tu t'es abonne
Wesh la famille, on dit quoi ?
Sidiki Diabate, 4keus, que des r'prises de volee
Non, me derange pas, j'suis au charbon du matin au soir
Non, nous derange pas, on est au charbon du matin au soir
J'ai grandi dans le bendo, nos mamans nous portent sur l'dos
On a grandit dans le bendo, nos mamans nous portent sur l'dos


Mes soucis me font perdre du poids
Malgre ca je ne plie pas
Je pete la forme, tant qu'j'ai l'front sur le pis-ta
La miff j'ai soif, donc sert moi un verre de bissap
J'veux faire des thunes, tout raffler comme a Kidal
Gros big up au Ghana, les cousins de Dakar
Les danseurs du Congo, les richesses du Mali
Pour l'Comores et ses iles, les otages en Libye
Les diamants du Zaire, mon Afrique est magique


Mais pourquoi tu m'en veux, c'est Dieu qui m'a donne
J'suis desole, faut pas jalouser
J'ai fait comme ma daronne, eh ouais j'ai charbonne
Oh la la, la j'suis fatigue
Wesh la famille, on dit quoi ?
Tu jactes sur mon dos, tous les mois, mais tu t'es abonne
Wesh la famille, on dit quoi ?
Sidiki Diabate, 4keus, que des r'prises de volee
Non, me derange pas, j'suis au charbon du matin au soir
Non, nous derange pas, on est au charbon du matin au soir
J'ai grandi dans le bendo, nos mamans nous portent sur l'dos
On a grandi tdans le bendo, nos mamans nous portent sur l'dos
Non, me derange pas, j'suis au charbon du matin au soir
Non, nous derange pas, on est au charbon du matin au soir
J'ai grandi dans le bendo, nos mamans nous portent sur l'dos
On a grandit dans le bendo, nos mamans nous portent sur l'dos

You know just what to say
Things that scare me
I should just walk away
But I can't move my feet

The more that I know you, the more I want to
Something inside me's changed
I was so much younger yesterday, oh

I didn't know that I was starving 'til I tasted you
Don't need no butterflies when you give me the whole damn zoo
By the way, right away you do things to my body
I didn't know that I was starving 'til I tasted you

By the way, right away you do things to my body
I didn't know that I was starving 'til I tasted you

You know just how to make
My heart beat faster
Emotional earthquake
Bring on disaster

You hit me head on, got me weak in my knees
Something inside me's changed
I was so much younger yesterday, oh
So much younger yesterday, oh oh

I didn't know that I was starving 'til I tasted you
Don't need no butterflies when you give me the whole damn zoo
By the way, right away you do things to my body
I didn't know that I was starving 'til I tasted you

By the way, right away you do things to my body
I didn't know that I was starving 'til I tasted you
You, yeah, 'til I tasted you

By the way, right away you do things to my body
I didn't know that I was starving 'til I tasted you

The more that I know you, the more I want to
Something inside me's changed
I was so much younger yesterday

True to the game
Was whipping the range
When I was new to the game
Dope on the digital scale
I was just whipping the yayo
I got a felony
I got a cousin, I can't even visit in jail
He was just serving some rock
Straight out the burglar bars
Benz truck, I spent a hunnid
Don't fuck with no regular cars
She not a regular broad
My bitch neck on icey
I got juice like Hi-C
Just do me like Nike

Suck my dick politely

You ain't never seen nothing like me

Smile in her face

All of this money I'm stackin

I ain't even got no sleep
Grinding for a whole damn week

Caught me with the dope in them car

Tratandome como un muneco roto

En bolsitas del Pryca

Dime, que hago lo que me pidas

Tengo llagas en la boca de chuparte
Me duele la nariz, del pelo esnifarte
Lo unico que me queda es fumarte
Este colocon es caso aparte
Yo te quiero de fiarte
Pero no tengo dinero de fiarme
Tienen que aprender a amarme
Ellos me quieren firmar, yo contratarte

Me da amor en micras
En bolsitas del Pryca
La droga mas rica

Mi heroina (uohh)
Mami, tu cuerpo es mi heroina (ohh)
Es la mierda que me domina (ohh)

Soy un yonki de tu sexo
Y un obseso de tus besos
Gozo con tu cuerpo noches, oh

Si al final me veo preso

Necesito mi dosis
Y esa mierda, tu cuerpo

Me da amor en micras
En bolsitas del Pryca
La droga mas rica

Es la mierda que me domina (ohh)

So give me all your backseat lovin', lovin'

We look so small from the hill
It's so surreal how you make me feel
Put my head down on your chest
You look at me while I undress

You turning me on
Like a favorite song
All night long
Gonna be feeling like home
Feeling like home

So give me all your backseat lovin', lovin'
'Cause I really like the way you're holding, holding me
So don't let go now, don't let go now
Just give me all your backseat lovin', lovin'

We don't have time to hesitate
When I make you stay, no more mistakes
Looking at the skyline silhouette
Sippin' on my wine
You smoke your cigarettes

You turning me on
Like a favorite song
All night long
Gonna be feeling like home
Feeling like home

So give me all your backseat lovin', lovin'
'Cause I really like the way you're holding, holding me
So don't let go now, don't let go now
Just give me all your backseat lovin', lovin'

I don't want to set the world on fire
Hi Kevin


Pussy nigga I ride with da fye

Pussy nigga I ride with da fye
Ran a half a mill since Granny died
You want smoke better bring a vest

Lil Gnar, big guap
Big bitch ass shots
Tatted up my whole neck cause I'm up next
Don't give a fuck diamonds skateboard got some VV rocks

All these niggas pussy nigga you can't rock with us
You ain't solid broke nigga you can't rock with us
From the land where they drop niggas

Pussy nigga I ride with da fye
Ran a half a mill since Granny died
You want smoke better bring a vest
Who want smoke aim it at yo neck
Pussy nigga I ride with da fye
Ran a half a mill since Granny died
You want smoke better bring a vest
Who want smoke aim it at yo neck


Bad shit
Big Dracos big body Benz
I'm out the gym flexing
Bring the thots and all their friends
Moving units coming thru and cash on deck
Foreign whips foreign chicks foreign garments
Who's next uzi and the tec leave em wet
Choppa bullets raining gang on his head (dots)
Tell my momma I got it no need for college
Not from Boston but marathon fuckin popping


Pussy nigga I ride with da fye
Ran a half a mill since Granny died
You want smoke better bring a vest
Who want smoke aim it at yo neck
Pussy nigga I ride with da fye
Ran a half a mill since Granny died

What if it only took one more dream
To say what we wanted to say
I see baby, let's have one more too many
And get all those words out the way
Get to the part where we're just past too far
'Cause the bartender just kept on pouring
It might be wrong but it might be right
Guess we'll find out in the morning

Let's do something stupid
Let's do something stupid
If you're thinking what I'm thinking
Then let's get outta here
It's my kinda good bad idea
Let's do something stupid

What if we really did wake up in love
Is that so hard to believe
And what if the thing we always wanted
Turned into what always will be
And what if we never had that last drink
And never wound up in this bed
We'll never make this perfect mistake
It started last night when you said

Let's do something stupid
Let's do something stupid
If you're thinking what I'm thinking
Then let's get outta here
It's my kinda good bad idea
Let's do something stupid

Well baby if it feels good do it
Well maybe we should just get to it
Let's do something stupid
Let's do something stupid

Let's do something stupid
(Let's do something stupid)
Let's do something stupid
(Let's do something stupid)

If you're thinking what I'm thinking
Then let's get outta here
It's my kinda good bad idea
Let's do something stupid
Let's do something stupid
Let's do something stupid

If I was a warrior
What would be my weapon
Forgiveness
Laughter
Sound
My riches sky and ground
Like the smell of pine
In forests that drip divine
Darkness sublime
In a blue sky mind
Stainless

Turn the pages of a story of circles
Where I am that I am
Where all paths join hands in the lands I remember
Where I am returned to my sender
Fully surrounded I surrender

Where the darkness illumines
My doubts lay in ruin

Su mama murio, pero dicen que se parecian
Las dos sabian que algun dia alguna llegaria
Tiene tres hermanos, uno esta en prision
Y una hermana que se fue en cuanto tuvo ocasion
Se reian de que su familia fuera pobre
Su papa pelaba cables pa' vender el cobre
Encima, nacio mujer en un mundo de hombres
Pero se juro que iban a conocer su nombre
Consiguio llegar a ser la mas dura del bloque
Compro un kilo a la mitad y lo saco al doble
Nadie sabe como lo hizo, pero se hizo hueco
La vida es un juego y tu solo eres su muneco
Ahora le ha comprao' un piso a su papa
Y no tiene miedo si tiene que hacer... (pum pum)
Dice que pa' la proxima navidad
Va a juntar a su familia como haria su mama

Tu eres duro, tu eres puro
Pero ella es mas
Tu eres loco, tu eres chulo
Pero ella es mas
Ella es mucho mas, mas que tu
Tu eres duro, tu eres puro
Pero ella es mas
Tu eres loco, tu eres chulo
Pero ella es mas
Ella es mucho mas, mas que tu

La pillaron una vez, pero pago la fianza
Y aunque sabe que la siguen, aun tiene confianza
Tiene mucho, pero debe mucho mas
Y tiene que hacer mucho mas si se quiere marchar
La hermana que se fue, ha vuelto con dos hijos
Y unas cuantas deudas, pero no tiene marido
Su padre, como siempre, esta bebido
El hermano que tenia preso, ya ha salido
Y ella tiene que vender si los quiere mantener
La vida es un puto juego y a ella la toca mover
Cuando negocios va a hacer, se que te va a convencer
Porque es una buscavidas y te sabe conmover
Y ella tiene que vender si los quiere mantener
La vida es un puto juego y a ella la toca mover
Cuando negocios va a hacer, se que te va a convencer
Porque es una buscavidas y te sabe conmover

Tu eres duro, tu eres puro
Pero ella es mas
Tu eres loco, tu eres chulo
Pero ella es mas
Ella es mucho mas, mas que tu
Tu eres duro, tu eres puro
Pero ella es mas
Tu eres loco, tu eres chulo
Pero ella es mas
Ella es mucho mas, mas que tu

I had a vision
I tried to warn them, but they didn't listen
So now they view from the sidelines, watching it all come together
It's time for the intervention, It's time for a new religion
I met the stars but I feel the same, come off the plane and it feel different
To come home and feel distant, I'm trapped in my head but swear I'm still in it
And I'ma stay here, so get used to me
Ain't the same person that I used to be but still humanly, we breathe the same air
Looking at the game like a daycare
The team too strong, they like "Towk, you ain't playing fair"
Watch me just manifest, Frankenstein, make it come to life
Float to the skies like Pegasus, I might burn alive
Won't regret my mistake, trust in the sciences
Gotta feel that heat just to know how hot that fire get
And I'ma keep supplying it, because it's high in demand
I got a hunger that could silence the lambs
And if I fail, bet I try it again
They prolly try and attack, they shoot shots bet I fire 'em back
Like "pop, pop, pop"
Hit 'em like oh my god, pull yo' card
Why you tryna act that hard?
So show some proof, want it, we can go there too
That's not the move, been holding back but now I'm 'bout to let it loose

And if you want it, what you tryna do?
And if you got it, then just show me some proof
I just

And really I'm 'bout to let it loose
I'm 'bout to let it loose
Now I'm 'bout to let it loose
Really I'm 'bout to let it loo-

Let's pretend we're seventeen
I think you know what I mean
Baby let's go take a drive
Do the things we used to do on Saturday Nights

'Cause it's all about lovin', all about huggin'
All about holdin' you tight
And it's all about kissin', thinkin' 'bout lovin'
All about lovin' tonight

We'll go park in my old truck
Maybe steam the windows up
Let's go lose all track of time
'Cause if we see the sun come up nobody would mind

'Cause it's all about lovin', all about huggin'
All about holdin' you tight
And it's all about kissin', thinkin' 'bout lovin'
All about lovin' tonight

We got moonlight, we got moonshine
We got the radio, it just feels right
So come on let's go

Yeah it's all about lovin', all about huggin'
All about holdin' you tight
And it's all about kissin', thinkin' 'bout lovin'
All about lovin' tonight

Well it's all about lovin', all about huggin'
All about holdin' you tight
And it's all about kissin', thinkin' 'bout lovin'
All about lovin' tonight
Yes it is

Oh, I'm gonna hit you where it hurts because
I know what to say to make it worse
I always get the last word in
Somehow I never seemed to learn it

Closest to me, I always hurt the closest ones to me
Closest to me, I always hurt the closest ones to me

Oh, no no no

I speak before I know what I mean
Talk through my ego not my thinking
Stomp around gonna throw myself a tantrum
Even if it's with the best intention
Don't give me that look that I hate
Like every word I said was a mistake
How'd you really think it would go over
Warming up to my cold shoulder

Closest to me, I always hurt the closest ones to me
Closest to me, I always hurt the closest ones to me

Oh, no no no

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah I know, I know, I know that I
Should apologize (apologize, apologize, apologize)
Oh, but I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Oh god, I'm sorry

Closest to me, I always hurt the closest ones to me
Closest to me, I always hurt the closest ones to me
Closest to me, I always hurt the closest ones to me
Closest to me, I always hurt the closest ones to me

Oh, no no no
---------------------------------------------------
No trippin' up
No losing touch
Just keep your eye on where the deal was
No switchin' lanes
No second take
One false start and you lose your nerve

Say you're with me
Say you're here for the long shot
Been taking calls in the dead of night
I got my own set of complications
No one can hear me right

Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down (bring me down)
I just found love in a cruel town
Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down (bring me down)
I got no time for that other shit now
Ah-oh
Oh-oh-ah-oh
Oh, the other one
Return from checking out
Don't bring me down
Don't bring me d-d-down
Too far gone to be stopping this now

Hit the lobby bell
And help yourself
Guys in here never break a sweat
Little maladroit
No compass point
Taking swings any chance they get

Say you're with me
Say you're here for the long shot
Keep hearing shouts in the dead of night
I've got my own set of complications
Nobody's counting right

Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down (bring me down)
I've just found love in a cruel town
Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down (bring me down)
I got no time for that other shit now
Ah-oh
Oh-oh-ah-oh
Oh, the other one
Return from checking out
Don't bring me down
Don't bring me d-d-down
Too far gone to be stopping this now

Way-faced sickers
Stone boy trippers
Last chance figures
Someone's in a rhythm
Kick it
Riptide rhythms
Half court visions
Quick desicions
Who's in the box seat now?

Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down
I just found love in a cruel town
Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down (bring me down)
I got no time for that other shit
Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down (bring me down)
I just found love in a cruel town
Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down (bring me down)
I got no time for that other shit now
Ah-oh
Oh-oh-ah-oh
Oh, the other one
Return from checking out
Don't bring me down
Don't bring me d-d-down
Too far gone to be stopping this now

Another panic attack
As I was browsing the stacks
And the books were falling in an avalanche
Though he sensed I was trapped
He was busy with... something

Now I'm checking my phone
But I don't want to talk
Don't wanna lopside my language
No I don't wanna go off

'Cause I lean in when I suffer
Lean in when I suffer

A panic attack
Though my directive's relax
It's beyond my skill set
Covetous of the calm wit
From a tyke uninvolved
All abyss with no clapback

I'm checking my phone
He's unworthy of talk
If he really wants to be the one
He'd forfeit shotgun for once

'Cause I lean in when I suffer
Lean in when I suffer

But I take him back to the county fair
I take him back, though he don't deserve to be there
He drew a bath and floated there
He cares a lot
We're strictly speaking self-care

Lean in when I suffer
Lean in when I suffer again
Lean in when I suffer
Lean in when I suffer again

Lean in when I suffer
Lean in when I suffer

Checking my phone
But I don't want to talk
Don't wanna lopside my language
No I don't wanna go

Well how'd you get to be so sweet
And how'd you get to be so nice
I know that there's a compromise though
So I'll give you your space now

Yeah how'd you get to look so good
'N how'd you get a smile like that
I know that it's time for facts though
So I'll give you your space now

Maybe if my head was in the right place
And if you and I were on the same page
We could find something that is worth keeping
If I wasn't so used to them leaving

Maybe if my glass was always half full
We could sit and drink until it's last call
Maybe I'm just caught up in my dreaming
But it's rare I ever have this feeling

Well how'd you get to be so sweet
And how'd you get to be so nice
I know that there's a compromise though
So I'll give you your space now

Yeah how'd you get to look so good
'N how'd you get a smile like that
I know that it's time for facts though
So I'll give you your space now

Con firmeza pa delante luchaban dos
generales don Joaquin Guzman el chapo
y Zambada el senor Mayo.

De mi historia
de la mafia presidente
surgieron muchos carteles
pero la guerra siguio.

De la tuna
tambien de Badiraguato
los recuerdos se quedaron
por tierras que camine.

Decisiones efectivas
que cambiaron a mi vida,
con la ayuda de mi gente
pude llegar al poder.

De mi pueblo
tan querido y tan humano
todos juntos como hermanos
logramos permanecer
Mis mujeres
de mis hijos adorados
mis amigos son contados
entre ellos el quinto mes.

Talibanes con rifles y empecherados
equipo especializado
para cuidar al senor,

Con firmeza pa delante luchaban dos
generales don Joaquin Guzman el chapo
y Zambada el senor Mayo.

Worthy of every song we could ever sing
Worthy of all the praise we could ever bring
Worthy of every breath we could ever breathe
We live for You, oh, we live for You

Jesus, the name above every other name
Jesus, the only One who could ever save
Worthy of every breath we could ever breathe
We live for You, we live for You

Holy, there is no one like You, there is none beside You
Open up my eyes in wonder and
Show me who You are and fill me with Your heart
And lead me in Your love to those around me

Jesus, the name above every other name

And I will put my trust in You alone and I will not be shaken

I'm always searchin' for answers
Down here reachin' for the stars
The only truth that I've ever found
Is for me there's no such thing as solid ground

I'm walking on water, floatin' on air
What lies beneath me is really not there
I know that love is everywhere
I'm walking on water, floatin' on air

Why do I care how people see me?
Why do we wanna hold on to you?
And what if the questions are the answers?
What if there's no such thing as the truth?

We're just walking on water, floatin' on air
What lies beneath us is really not there
I know that love is everywhere
I'm walking on water, floatin' on air

I still believe in miracles
Things may not be as they seem
In my imagination
I'm livin' in a dream

I'm walking on water, floatin' on air
What lies beneath me is really not there
I know that love is everywhere
I'm walking on water, floatin' on air

I'm walking on water, floatin' on air
What lies beneath me is really not there
I know that love is everywhere
I'm walking on water, floatin' on air
I'm walking on water
Floatin' on air

Que Se Me Pasa
(Que se le pasa)
Este amor
Que me mandaba pa' tu casa

Se fue al carajo
Ya ando en las nubes ya no estoy volando bajo..

Que Se Me Pasa
(Que se le pasa)
Este amor
Que sentia por una payasa

No soy el mismo
Ya ando cambiando
Al otro yo
Que se andaba suicidando..

Pero ya no..

Ya no, ya no te amo
Ya no te amo
Ningun traguito
Son pensando en tu persona

No he de aferrarme
Ya no he de aferrarme
A una maldita relacion
Que no funciona

Ya no te amo
Ya eres pasado
Voy a olvidar
Esos momentos a tu lado

Vas a extranarme
Te lo aseguro
Cuando no tengas
Cuando no tengas

Ni pasado, ni presente ni futuro..

Ya no, ya no te amo

Can I tell my side of a street nigga yeah
Yeah oh
Can I tell my side

On the block from 9 to 5 we getting paper in the middle of the jungle with that burner on me
For them long nights we grind cause we had nothing
Look I just want that money stuff them hundreds on me
My partner lost his mind when he switched sides
Now he crossed the line
But I just want that bread and niggas want me dead (Yeah)

Ever since that I came they putting dirt on my name
In public they don't say nothing
Cause they know I'm with the shits, this 40 came with a dick head
Came up from nothing from that two piece of chicken but
Niggas I love they hate the fact that I'm getting rich
But what goes around comes around
Gotta watch my back cause they plotting to gun me down
I'm going through this day after day
I kept it real with you bitches I would've killed for my niggas
Its funny how people change on me
And this the story of my life cross my heart and hope to die

And I
Ima keep it gangsta till the day I die
And I
Could never be a snitch without no paperwork they tellin lies
And nigga this time
Oh I'm pullin up its homicide, ima shut it down
And I

They think they be playing crazy
Boy fuck that lil 380 FNN in my jeans
When I unload shoot this bitch and aim it yelling "fuck who and all they came with" hope they die that's on me
And bitch its homicide when I get out

They say you wrong, that nigga did it
Niggas ain't getting it how they say they living

Won't catch me riding with a messy hoe with me

Due to the fact that my heart is so wicked
Break on a bitch I got hoes on restriction (Hey)

And I
Ima keep it gangsta till the day I die
And I
Could never be a snitch without no paperwork they tellin lies
And nigga this time
Oh I'm pullin up its homicide, ima shut it down
And I
Know they gone hate on 3 for whatever

Nunca voy a olvidarme del rancho
siempre voy a sentirme orgulloso
como extrano sus calles de tierra
cuando bebiamos agua del pozo.

A las 4 los gallos cantaban
a las 5 ladraban los perros
a las 6 el molino da vueltas
y al trabajo van los jornaleros.

Un pedazo de tierra sembrado
4 vacas un puerco en engorda
una yunta jalando el arado
y mi apa' desgranando mazorca.

El comal con la lena del cerro
y mi abuela torteando a las 7
los frijoles sirviendo el la hoya
y mi abuelo afinando el machete.

Un sombrero viejo y maltratado
tres camisas y dos pantalosnes
los guaraches ya estan desgastados
pero no me averguenza ser pobre.

Nunca voy a olvidarme del rancho
siempre voy a sentirme orgulloso
como extrano sus calles de tierra
y a las senoras con su reboso.

Verde verde el color de las plantas
Que bonitas se ven las barrancas
Verde verde el billete que causan
Pues bonito la mente relajan
Con un toce al cerbro lo viajan
Y a mis bolsillos llega la lana

Mis plantitas son la mera palpa
Los clientes vienen desde Jamaica
En California rentamos casas
Pues a los gueros nadien les gana
Por computadora crecen plantas
No les gusta la de las montanas

Verde verde el color de las plantas
Tan bonitas como las montanas
O en los cuartos tambien bien fociadas
Luz y irrigacion bien programada
Esa es calidad garantizada

Bien chiclosa se queda pegada
En los dedos cuando ay que rolarla
El humo corre por mi garganta
Un efecto a la mente le manda
Si esta buena, venta confirmada
En Sonora ya esta bien tratada

Verde verde el color de las plantas
Tan bonitas como las montanas
O en los cuartos tambien bien fociadas
Luz y irrigacion bien programada
Esa es calidad garantizada

24hrs, 3200 Lenox Road
That's where it all started
Ha, ha

Tell the story 'bout your life, tell the story 'bout your life

Tell the story 'bout your life, tell the story 'bout your life
Girl, lot of wrongs a lot of rights, a lot of wrongs a lot of rights

Lenox Road it's me and bro

Scrap round, my dawg never backed down, man

Tell the story 'bout your life, tell the story 'bout your life

Never make it what they always used to tell me
I'd die by the squad and the team know it
When I touched my first 50, I let Phin hold it
Bagged some Alexander in the trunk (skrrt)
I got my queen in the front
Drip, I got water on my wrist
Sold out shows on my list
I ain't second guessing
Y'all just started rapping
Then I caught a nigga slip, and need another weapon

Tell the story 'bout your life, tell the story 'bout your life
A lot of wrongs a lot of rights, a lot of wrongs a lot of rights
Tell the story 'bout your life, tell the story 'bout your life

Lo que buscaba en ti
Era felicidad en tiempo real
Lo que mi ex no tenia

Lo que buscaba en ti
Era una relacion en armonia
Esa sonrisa al despertar
Tus besos y tu compania

Lo que buscaba en ti
Era amor verdadero
Un te amo, un te quiero
Que saliera de tu alma

Lo que buscaba en ti
Era la verdad, no la mentira
No fuiste lo que yo esperaba
Me dabas la espalda cuando te buscaba

Lo que buscaba en ti
Era una nueva vida
Tu me la prometiste
Pero solo te reiste de mi

Lo que buscaba en ti
No lo pude encontrar
Por eso en momentos me viste llorar
Maldita mi sonrisa que duro unos dias
Porque yo pensaba que tu me querias

Lo que buscaba en ti
Eran buenos momentos
Pero eso no paso
Nunca hubo buenos tiempos
Por eso terminamos hace algunos dias
En ti buscaba amor
Pero no tenias
No sentias

Lo que buscaba en ti
No lo pude encontrar
Por eso en momentos me viste llorar
Maldita mi sonrisa que duro unos dias
Porque yo pensaba que tu me querias
Lo Que Buscaba En Ti
Eran buenos momentos
Pero eso no paso
Nunca hubo buenos tiempos
Por eso terminamos hace algunos dias
En ti buscaba amor
Pero no tenias
No sentias

Y descubri que amar asi
Como te ame no es lo mejor
Que fue un error
Haber creido en ti tambien
Porque en tus besos
No habia miel
---------------------------------------------------
It feels so strange
Shameless to think of death
When none of those one knows has died

Last night I dreamt I was dead
I came running with my dog into the room of the dead

There was nothing to be seen
Only stones and a few bushes
A landscape that travellers have often spoken of

I would rather not die here
But in my own home, where I was not dead

All the death
All the death
In the course of life and death

Write about death
Describe in the poem what you feel, concerning death

In the face of death I'm like an animal
And the animal can die but write nothing

The words die like flies
Their corpses everywhere, swept away from the white paper

Give the dirty little room
---------------------------------------------------
Fais voir tes fesses
J'veux un gros plan pendant que je fume ma premiere presse
On etait rien on est devenus les Princes de la Ville comme 113
Tu parles beaucoup sur le net, j'espere pouvoir te rencontrer
T'imagines pas tout c'qu'on a du affronter, dix heures du mat' sur l'rrain-te
Il me faut des nouvelles Nike les miennes passeront pas l'hiver
Ma mere pleure tous les jours ca fait deux ans qu'elle paye plus ce putain de loyer
Pour un entretien c'est mort, nique tous ses morts, la putain d'ses morts
J'traine quelques remords
Meme ta mere nous jalouse elle essaye d'nous jeter un sort
Le rap c'est un sport, on est dans l'jeu, on est dangereux
J'ai fait le pour et le contre, plus d'argent que d'amis ouais
C'est ca l'enjeu, j'remercie Dieu, j'suis pas chanceux
J'suis pas comme eux, moi aussi j'suis QLF
Ma famille seulement pour te laisser en PLS
J'coupe la plaque, j'ecoute l'album Reve de Rue de TLF
Et j'roule un te3 avec les miettes
J'traine avec des renois j'mange du tiep
A chaque anniversaire, j'fais pas la fete
Mes habits sont sales, frerots j'fais tiep

Seul Dieu m'arrete j'ai le power ouais
Princesse goute a ce champagne-shower
Fragile est l'amour, solide est la peur
Je serais mort a t'ecouter petit hater
Depuis petit j'ai connu que le darwa
Association d'malfaiteurs, crime organise, darwa
Yeah, yeah j'peux mourir demain
Yeah, yeah j'peux mourir demain

Y'a de l'alcool y'a des bitches y'a du produit
C'est Katrina Squad qui produit
Meme moi je sais plus qui je suis
Une graine de rockstar ou un OG ?
J'suis en independant
J'me gere comme un patron ouais j'ai du repondant
J'te fais croquer t'es toujours pas content
Demain tu parles a mon repondeur
A l'ecole j'ai perdu mon temps, j'ai rate l'diplome
J'la calcule pas cette folle
Tu parles sur moi tu fais foye
Quand j'pense a eux je rigole
J'suis dans la zone, comme d'hab'
J'suis tout pres du four, comme d'hab'
Tu m'racontes ta vie, j'm'en tape
Ouais, ouais, j'm'en tape
On arrive on est tarpin, ca parle meme plus
Elle ecarte hun, VGS tu connais l'cartel
J'sens plus la pauvrete je sens le Pierre Cardin
J'suis dans la zone, comme d'hab'
J'suis tout pres du four, comme d'hab'
Tu m'racontes ta vie, j'm'en tape
Ouais, ouais, j'm'en tape

Seul Dieu m'arrete j'ai le power ouais
Princesse goute a ce champagne-shower

I was flying into Chicago at night
Watching the lake turn the sky into blue-green smoke
The sun was setting to the left of the plane
And the cabin was filled with an unearthly glow
In 27-D, I was behind the wing
Watching the landscape roll out like credits on a screen

And I said, "look, look to your left, passengers
Look, look to your right
You can pretend that you're here from outer space
And this, this is your very first sight"

The earth looked like it was lit from within
Like a big manmade electrical ball
As we moved out of the farmlands and into the grid
The plan of a city was all that you saw
And all of these people sitting totally still
As the ground raced beneath them 30,000 feet down

And I said, "look, look to your left, passengers
Look, look to your right
You can pretend that you're here from the fifth century
And this, this is your very first flight"

And I was pretending that I was in a Galaxie 500 video
The stewardess came back and checked on my drink
And I swear that she looked just like Brigitte Bardot
As I had on my walkman, and I had on those eyes
That you get when your circumstance is movie-size

And I said, "look, look to your left, passengers
Look, look to your right
You can pretend that the plane's going to crash in five minutes
And this, this is your very last sight"

"You'd better look, look to your left, passengers
You'd better look, look to your right
Cause I'm going to take this plane out in less than five minutes
And this, this is your very last sight"

En una troca bonita, una toyota por cierto
Asi se paseaba manny, siempre feliz y contento
Era de sangre valiente, michoacano cien por ciento

Domingo doce de marzo del dos mil doce corria
como a las seis de la tarde, dijo que pronto volvia aun no saben si esta vivo o si ya no esta con vida

Su madresita llorando llorando se lo decia
por favor hijito mio no te vallas este dia
tengo un mal presentimiento de que volveras sin vida

El nunca quizo escuchar los consejos de su madre y se empezo a involucrar en cosas irremediables y lo desaparecieron esas falsas amistades

Alla en phoenix arizona tenia muchas amistades, tambien alla en nueva italia
en sonora bien lo saben era pollero el muchacho apodado el aguacate

Sus carnales lo recuerdan siempre feliz y contento toquen el muchacho alegre con esas se acuerda el perro cuando siempre lo miraban quemando llanta en los cerros

Oui, oui, si, si
C'est Remy
C'est Remy
Ca vient d'Auber mon frere
Oui, oui


Et je compte mes sse-lia, mais la vie c’est pas comme ca
J'ai compte les che-la, qui parlent que quand t'es pas la
Et j'ai regarde mes che-po, qui se vident comme le bendo
J'ai regarde mon passe, et je veux y rester comme Nintendo
Ouais, la rue tu n'controles pas, ouais, la rue c'est pas un jeu
J'ai des potos au card-pla, recidivistes, pris la main dans le sac
J'ai regarde ma ville, j'baiserai toujours les BACeux
J'ai regarde dans l'vide, maman m'tenait par la beuge
J'ai regarde le futur, c'etait bizarre, c'etait flou
J'ai vu que mon passe frappe dur, j'ai vu papa a genoux
J'ai vu lui faire la femmelette, j'ai vu lui se manger des coups
Tu sais qu'un petit qu't'as vu naitre, peut te la mettre en un coup

J'ai vu lui sur sa planete, j’ai vu lui sur son bateau
J’ai vu lui dans son train de vie, payer a l'encre de sa peau
Pas un E pour une canette, pas un heureux dans l'ghetto
Tu sais qu'un petit qu't'as vu naitre, peut se reveiller et te faire la peau
J'ai vu lui sur sa planete, j’ai vu lui sur son bateau
J’ai vu lui dans son train de vie, payer a l'encre de sa peau
Pas un E pour une canette, pas un heureux dans l'ghetto
J'ai vu lui sur sa planete, j’ai vu lui sur son bateau

J'ai vu lui dans sa villa, endette de problemes comme Aurier
J’ai vu lui dans son village, qui a investi pour que l'eau soit filtree
J’ai vu lui pleurer par terre, juste parce que sa copine l'a quitte
J’ai vu lui le visage ferme, alors que sa famille se fait bombarder
J’ai vu lui le corps tout mouille, sourire qui se melange a la souffrance
Qui a traverse une mer gelee, en esperant rejoindre la France
J'ai vu lui taffer son dribble, en esperant rejoindre les Celtics
J'ai vu cet homme pas confiant, qui tous les jours s'bat contre ses tics
J'ai vu des gens pareils, des gens se battre pour la difference
J’vois des gens qui votent FN, j’en vois qui veulent se barrer de la France
Ici c'est la merde, partout c'est la meme, dans ce pays rien a gratter
R.E.M.Y, d'Aubervilliers, j'viens refaire du rap francais

J'ai vu lui sur sa planete, j’ai vu lui sur son bateau
J’ai vu lui dans son train de vie, payer a l'encre de sa peau
Pas un E pour une canette, pas un heureux dans l'ghetto
Tu sais qu'un petit qu't'as vu naitre, peut se reveiller te faire la peau
J'ai vu lui sur sa planete, j'ai vu lui sur son bateau
J'ai vu lui dans son train de vie, payer a l'encre de sa peau
Pas un E pour une canette, pas un heureux dans l'ghetto
J'ai vu lui sur sa planete, j'ai vu lui sur son bateau

Mes potes sont la au mauvais moment pour prendre ta monnaie
Les suceurs, on les connait
Les pouci', on les connait
J'rentrais chez moi, sous l'son des cross, j'avais pas poney
Mes ce-vi, j'les connais, donc fais pas l'etonne
Dis un mot de travers et tu vas faire des tonneaux
On veut passer les frontieres avec les codes errones
On veut s'remettre dans l'droit chemin sans regarder les panneaux
On veut tous faire une Montana en evitant d'caner
On veut eviter d'se noyer sans s'mettre dans les canaux
Moi, j'vais t'faire decouvrir un monde dans lequel t'es pas ne
Sur une instru qui fait bouger ou meme sur un piano

Why do we have to go and face the same routine? (Do do do do do do do do do)
And the traffic jams and crowded street's a real neurotic scene (Do do do do do do do do do)
I don't know, why do we take it each day, yeah yeah

Why does my girl tell me she's got to have her way? (Do do do do do do do do do do)
Out all night, come home to fight, what am I to say? (Do do do do do do do do do do)
I don't know, why do we take it each day, yeah yeah-eah yeah

Life is what it is
Who wants to try not to believe?
That's the way it is
Oh, oh

I don't know why what you feel inside (Days go on)
Love is something that you just can't hide (If it's wrong)
Then you'll want to know, you don't know why (I sing a song)
And it helps me yet, I'll get by (At times)
Lost in time, sometimes your mind unwinds (Sun does shine)
But no pleasure from your beauty's mine (Like champagne wine)
A bitter taste, ooh, that's so refined (Life it's fine)
You always pay for what, what's behind

I love you, I hate you
I'll kiss you, I'll kill you
I'm toxic and deadly
This chaos controls me

There's no way to fix it
When broken is better
When I'm just a normie
They all just ignore me

I'm salty, she's sweeter
The world needs more like her
The world needs more fighters
Not push over liars

Can we make it better
And stop starting fires?
No stairway to heaven
The way that we're headin

No more regrets
No more regrets
No more regrets
No more regrets

I'm sober, I'm wasted
My peers think I'm crazy
Bipolar and anxious
I'm always impatient

Should I just embrace it?
Prescriptions won't fix this
Don't trust me with fragile
Cuz I'll fuckin break it

Might die at a young age
I know this sounds cliche
I'll dance with the devil
But still count my blessings

Can we make this better?
Or is it just me?
On this highway to hell
And there's no way to tell

No more regrets
No more regrets
No more regrets

This is who I am
Nobody said you had to like it
This is who I am
A modern tragedy

This is who I am
Nobody said you had to like it
This is who I am
A modern tragedy

Bury your mistakes, clear those bones from your closet
With wisdom there's pain, so don't be afraid
No, no, no
No more regrets
(If this life is all we have)
No more regrets, no more regrets

This is who I am
Nobody said you had to like it
This is who I am
A modern tragedy

This is who I am
Nobody said you had to like it
This is who I am
A modern tragedy

Mis respetos

Nashville Cats, play clean as country water
Nashville Cats, play wild as mountain dew
Nashville Cats, been playin' since they's babies
Nashville Cats, get work before they're two

Well, there's thirteen hundred and fifty two
Guitar pickers in Nashville
And they can pick more notes than the number of ants
On a Tennessee anthill
Yeah, there's thirteen hundred and fifty two
Guitar cases in Nashville
And any one that unpacks 'is guitar could play
Twice as better than I will

Yeah, I was just thirteen, you might say I was a
Musical proverbial knee-high
When I heard a couple new-sounding tunes on the tubes
And they blasted me sky-high
And the record man said every one is a Yellow Sun
Record from Nashville
And up North there ain't nobody buys them
And I said, "But I will"

And it was
Nashville Cats, play clean as country water
Nashville Cats, play wild as mountain dew
Nashville Cats, been playin' since they's babies
Nashville Cats, get work before they're two

Well, there's sixteen thousand eight hundred 'n' twenty one
Mothers from Nashville
All their friends play music, and they ain't uptight
If one of the kids will
Because it's custom made for any mother's son
To be a guitar picker in Nashville
And I sure am glad I got a chance to say a word about
The music and the mothers from Nashville

Nashville Cats, play clean as country water
Nashville Cats, play wild as mountain dew
Nashville Cats, been playin' since they's babies
Nashville Cats, get work before they're two

Pick it

Yo I never switch up
They smile in my face, but it's never been love
They hating on Fred, but they've never been cunch
Best check yourself, before you wreck yourself
Going on my Instagram, you wanna stress yourself?
Them man there don't wanna see no young niggas popping
Nights in the cell, they had a young nigga rotting
Paper was low, so us young niggas robbing

All of these loubs in my room it's a wonderful problem
Mystro's home, that's my brother I got him
Hood niggas know, we done come up from shotting
Got foreigns in central and uckers in Tottenham
Turning halfs into 1 with my darg from the jump
Broski shooting he told me, you just gotta ask and it's done
So play like computers, he's clarting his gun
And yeah
I been through stress in the past with my mum
I try pay her back in Prada and love
Close to the opps, but I'm far from the luck
When this money comes easy, it's harder to trust
When we was on pedal bikes shooting at them
I never knew nuttin bout music and pens
Or writing a rap
Thought I'd spend my life in the trap
Now my pinkies are diamond and that
Still keep the smoke, we're riding with that
My girl's in Chanel, styling and that
Ask round town, say we're shining and that
But they don't play games, cause we're violent and that
You beef me on YouTube, cyber attack
I'm really getting money, I ain't rising to that
Morning, days and night in the trap
Had me losing my mind, but I'm finding it back
You whip out your ting, we're flying it back
The phone line ring, we fly out the pack
My niggas are drippy, who's flyer than sav?
We whip it up quickly, you lie in your raps
When I was young I was sleeping on sofas
Looking at money I don't pree the olders
Now I go Fendi and speak to the owners
They text me as soon as the season is over
We keep a revolver
Diamonds crying, they needing a shoulder
Styling and grinding, I'm dealing a boulder
Flying Dubai, but I'm speeding a Rover
When I come back I'll be re'ing a soldier
She's sucking, I'm driving, needing a chaffeur
Fendi no laces, g on the sofa
Gloves no traces, peeling you over
Got bread so we're keeping a toaster
My man's a snake and I don't deal with cobras
I'm just living my life, till my niggas are nice
Ain't my fault that you did it and died
Late for a show, I was whipping a 9
You niggas are broke, you should give it a try
Look at your watch, it ain't giving no shine
These big fat rocks they be swimming in mine
I'm sinning for mine
I ran past them man sitting in line
I live by the rassclart finishing line
Free all my real g's sitting inside
When you come home, you're gonna see a difference in life

Real difference in life
Free all my day 1's in the can
Nuttin but love for you niggas
Soon home

Yo I never switch up
They smile in my face, but it's never been love
They hating on Fred, but they've never been cunch
Best check yourself, before you wreck yourself
Going on my Instagram, you wanna stress yourself?
Them man there don't wanna see no young niggas popping
Nights in the cell, they had a young nigga rotting
Paper was low, so us young niggas robbing

Yo, I'm a go all the way type chick
In the stu' 'til I get it right, bitch
Nice house and a nice whip
Spending all your money up in Knightsbridge
Visualise, make a nigga fantasise
Water park, yeah he wanna slip and slide
Cool off baby, you can take a dive
Type of shit I've got him doing can't be televised
Hypnosis, he says I am the coldest
Get love from the youngers, got respect from the olders
Black girl magic, I've got that hocus-pocus
Oh I'm so focused
Lemme dust off my shoulders
I make hits, you can't hit it
The flow is exquisit
See me on the bill, can't miss it
Bare peng tings when I come thru
Hating bitches always doing what the bums do

Big batty gyal when we come thru
Hair looking laid when we come thru
Face on beat when we come thru
Nails on fleek when we come thru
We be on a wave when we come thru
Whole team slay when we come thru
Pop champagne when we come thru
Hating niggas always doing what the bums do

I be cutting ties with you niggas
Ride for you niggas
Even fucking lie for you niggas
You're a fraud, I don't really know who's hyping you nigga
Ain't my nigga, all this fuck shit just made me a killer
Going straight for your head
Lay you down before I put it to bed
On some bullshit and I see red
Get wrapped like tortillas
Sticky like quesadillas
You can't see me and I ain't Sia
Please believe, go hard for my P's
And my family, I'll do what I please
Go overseas, bring all my G's
Bare back and titties, we do it B-I-G
Talking bad, I pay a visit
I don't do gimmicks
I ain't got limits
Only real niggas when I come thru
Hating bitches always doing what the bums do

Big batty gyal when we come thru
Hair looking laid when we come thru
Face on beat when we come thru
Nails on fleek when we come thru
We be on a wave when we come thru
Whole team slay when we come thru
Pop champagne when we come thru
Hating niggas always doing what the bums do

Big batty gyal when we come thru
Hair looking laid when we come thru
Face on beat when we come thru
Nails on fleek when we come thru
We be on a wave when we come thru
Whole team slay when we come thru
Pop champagne when we come thru
Hating niggas always doing what the bums do

Big batty gyal when we come thru
Hair looking laid when we come thru
Face on beat when we come thru
Nails on fleek when we come thru
We be on a wave when we come thru
Whole team slay when we come thru
Pop champagne when we come thru
Hating niggas always doing what the bums do

Hasta la carcel fui a parar
Por una rata que hay por ahi
Me pusieron un 4 en la ciudad de Buena Park
Me fueron agarrar

En medio de la transaccion
Cuando la D.E.A me procuro
No supe que es lo que paso
3 anos me avente en prision

Recuerdo una semana atras
Andabamos en Michoacan
Con mi carnal El Chapo andabamos bien enfiestados
Billetes habia de mas

No sabian si iba a calentar
Problemas habia en la ciudad
Al regresar de Michoacan
El 4 listo estaba ya

Ya no me quiero ni acordar
Libretas yo ya estoy pa' atras
Mi gente se ha quedado con mi gente mi trabajo
Mi puesto firmes estan

Un buen vino quiero tomar
A la Kush tengo que esperar
El Sapo mas que listo esta
Para empezar a traficar..

Un pantera en la jaula esta
Un amigazo de verdad
El bombo de los fieles amigazos
Que mi confianza le he sabido brindar

El gordito ese es mi carnal
Al black nos vamos a llamar
Quiubo carnal donde andaras
aqui llegando a Miramar

El show se quiso calentar
Ya volvio a la normalidad
El gordito anda fuera
Pero en uno se ha quedado la perra de Mazatlan

El Sapo bien firme aqui esta
Trae la silla de su carnal
Aqui lo vamos a esperar
La antorcha voy a calentar

De vuelta estoy en la ciudad
Queriendo ir pa' Michoacan
Regresamos mas fuertes y el dinero mas facil
Por la puerta lo vio llegar

El Sapo me dicen por ahi
Cerquita estoy de Apatzingan
Ya nos vamos a retirar
Vamos con rumbo a Mazatlan

You light up when you're in range of the sound of misfortune
Someone shaking the change
String me up like a marionette dancing for you
Do you miss us at all?

You find what drives you and mesmerized you
Leaving us to discover love through...
The fascination isn't fascination unless it motivates you to death

Do you miss you miss us all?
Well never mind it's the same old rhetoric
And if you want to complain
Well would you mind remembering us for a change?

You find what drives and mesmerized you
Leaving us to discover love through...
The fascination isn't
The fascination isn't
The fascination unless
Do you miss us at all?
---------------------------------------------------
Today was not a good day
I forced myself to smile to pretend
But look at you
Can barely say our names
Because of you
We are all estranged

And now you will regret
That you left us here for dead
Now you're praying that we're all ok
And we're praying you'll come back some day

Now look at you
You can't even say our names
Look at you
Confused why you left anyway
So soon you'll regret everything
Look at you
Left us all for dead when you walked away

Before the sun even went down
You said I love you by letting us down

And now you will regret
That you left us here for dead
Now you're praying that we're all ok
You told us when you left
It'd be only for a day
Now you're praying that we're all ok
And we're praying you'll come back some day

But you can't even say our names
Look at you
Confused why you left anyway
So soon you'll regret everything
But soon you'll regret everything
But look at you
You left us all

And I must confess
I could not of loved you less
Confess
You could not have loved us less
Confess
You left us all for dead
You left us all for dead
You left us all

You can't even say our names
Look at you
Confused why you left anyway
So soon you'll regret everything
But soon you'll regret everything
But look at you
You left us all
Now look at you
You left us all

And now you will regret
That you left us here for dead
Now you praying that we're all ok
You told us when you left
It'd be only for a day
Now praying that we're all ok
Now you're praying that we're all ok

Prendiendo, un cigarrito,
Asi es como voy
A pasar el ratito,
Ando, ya bien quietito,
Quiero sentirme
De mas relajadito,
Esto ya no podran evitarlo,
Ya traigo la antorcha calentando...


Bueno, para atizarle,
Ventanas cerradas
Para empezar a rolarle,
Compa, el cigarrito,
Vallalo prendiendo
Pa’ quedar bien serenito,
Ahora ando rodeado de humareda,
La risita saben que me pega...


Paseme, ese churro,
Yo tambien quiero sentirme
Alla en el otro mundo,
Hongos, alucinantes,
En el bosque me veran
Quemando abajo de un huisache.


Vamos, sacando botes,
Ya ando apalabrando
Unas plebitas pa  la noche,
Se escuchan, las guitarras,
Un buen tololoche
Para empezar a cantarlas,
Para cotorrearlas un buen trago,
Saben que esta noche va pa’ largo...


Echenle, mas verde,
Saben que relaja
Cuando la lumbre la prenden,
Me pone, mas loco,
Esa sativona
Me puso los ojos rojos,
Forjense uno ya para jalarle,
Son las 4:20 de la tarde...


Saquen, otro gallito,
Que quiero perderme
Mientras me pega el humito,
Ando, bien tranquilito,
Forjenselo compa
Que ya ando relajadito.

Hot town, summer in the city
Back of my neck getting dirty and gritty
Been down, isn't it a pity?
Doesn't seem to be a shadow in the city
All around, people looking half dead
Walking on the sidewalk, hotter than a match head

But at night it's a different world
Go out and find a girl
Come on, come on and dance all night
Despite the heat it'll be all right

And babe, don't you know it's a pity
That the days can't be like the nights
In the summer, in the city
In the summer, in the city

Cool town, evening in the city
Dressing so fine and looking so pretty
Cool cat, looking for a kitty
Gonna look in every corner of the city
Till I'm wheezing like a bus stop
Running up the stairs, gonna meet you on the rooftop

But at night it's a different world
Go out and find a girl
Come on, come on and dance all night
Despite the heat it'll be all right

And babe, don't you know it's a pity
That the days can't be like the nights
In the summer, in the city
In the summer, in the city

Hot town, summer in the city
Back of my neck getting dirty and gritty
Been down, isn't it a pity?
Doesn't seem to be a shadow in the city
All around, people looking half dead
Walking on the sidewalk, hotter than a match head

But at night it's a different world
Go out and find a girl
Come on, come on and dance all night
Despite the heat it'll be all right

And babe, don't you know it's a pity
That the days can't be like the nights
In the summer, in the city
In the summer, in the city

I'm frustrated, I think I hate this
I can't even look interested
I think that the older I get, the harder it gets
Maybe I'm fine, maybe I'm dying
Oh, I'm just tired, tired of trying
To hold a conversation together
That means nothing at all

Small talks, small talks
We don't talk enough
Small talks too much
Somebody get me out of here

Are we friends, did I miss it?
Because you're talking at me like we're connected
Why should we pick it up, we never left it?
I'm too passive aggressive
Maybe it's mean, maybe it's bitter
And I don't wanna go down as a conversation quitter
But I just can't do it

Small talks, small talks
We don't talk enough
Small talks too much
Somebody get me out of here
Small talks, small talks
We don't talk enough

The grip you had on me
It's always there to see
The marks take solace
Embedded deep In my skin

Fixating on my weakness
The blackest of hearts
One hand controlled my future
One waved goodbye

Twitching, turning
Awake through this endless feeling

Let me out, I am so cold
Let me out, I am so cold
My body is tired of aching
I'm sick of waking up

To a life full of hate
Nothingness
A meaningless void

Patiently waiting for the tick of the clock

To start my endless slumber

This wilting landscape
No sign of life
I tried to escape
But still I live in fear

No institution
Can erase what's embedded in my skull

Embedded in my skull

My skull

The grip you had on me
It's always there to see
The marks take solace
Embedded deep in my skin

Fixating on my weakness
The blackest of hearts
One hand controlled my future
One waved goodbye

One waved goodbye

Kill the bully
Kill him faster
Kill him
Kill the bully
Kill him faster
Kill him now
---------------------------------------------------
The first time we made love
I wore socks
Now we're just worn out
Or maybe just worn down
We just fuck

I guess everybody grows
Out of somethings and into others, don't we?
But I hate the thought of
Growing out and into another

You're my favorite pair
Don't wanna throw you in the wash
No, I wouldn't dare
Lose any bit of what I love about you
Don't wanna lose you like that

It's been a year now and
I still feel good
And that's strange enough
Too soon to know it
But for now I want this
You're the one I see it all with

I guess everybody knows
The younger you are the less you're sure of most things
But I hate the thought
Of growing out and into another

You're my favorite pair
Don't wanna throw you in the wash
No, I wouldn't dare
Lose any bit of what I love about you
Don't wanna lose you like that

You're my favorite pair
Don't wanna throw you in the wash
No, I wouldn't dare
Lose any bit of what I love about you
Don't wanna lose you like that
---------------------------------------------------
Bang! My baby C4's at it again
Bang! My baby C4's at it again
I'm back as a bunnyman
Runnin' from the mirrors crashing
After me with her heavy, sharp throwing hammer

Not even all the luck in the world
Not even all the luck in the world
Not even all the luck in the world
Can soon save me from her nails
C4

Oh, when she gets that look in her eye
I know I'm in for a fright
She rolls up her Vogue magazine
And empties her magazine on me
Til I see stars, bang, my baby C4's started again
Late at night in bed, she whispers in my ear
"You're mine again"

Not even all the luck in the world
Not even all the luck in the world
Not even all the luck in the world
Can save me from her nails

"Oh, one day you'll know real fear
And you'll be lucky to be in my arms again"

Regarde-moi choufi fi 3ayniya
J't'ai regarde toute la soiree rejoins-moi
Parti d'zero c'est la remontada
Milano, Saint-Tropez, Marbella
Jamais de la vie, t'es plein de manies
Tu vas m'serrer, tu vas tchatcher
On arrive en i, prend ta go en i
On finit chez Valere Olivia
Millions, millions, millions
Elle me dit qu'elle me trouve mignon
Millions, millions, millions
Elle me dit qu'elle me trouve mignon

Dans mon del' j'suis tout seul et je m'en bats les reins
Je sais pas trop c'qu'ils veulent mais je m'en bats les reins

J'suis cale, j'vis comme si demain j'allais caner
J'suis cale, serein j'regarde le ciel etoile
J'suis cale, elle a fait qu'pister toute la soiree
J'suis cale, j'crois bien que ce soir ce sera le bon, la bonne combine
J'crois bien que ce soir ce sera le bon, la bonne combine
J'crois bien que ce soir ce sera le bon, la bonne combine
J'crois bien que ce soir ce sera le bon, la bonne combine
J'crois bien que ce soir ce sera le...

J'ai tenu le mur pendant des annees
Dans ma ville le 'zin tout l'monde me connait
Le charbon est a nous, le parking est a nous
Au terrain j'suis abonne
J'suis ok, j'suis choque
Que des Belvedere, du Jack Da, du Chardonney
Elle est choque, elle a serre, elle m'a geo-localise
Rien qu'tu tournes autour de moi
Tout c'que je sais c'est qu'tu vas glisser
Rien qu'tu tournes autour de moi
Tout c'que je sais c'est qu'tu vas glisser

Dans mon del' j'suis tout seul et je m'en bats les reins
Je sais pas trop c'qu'ils veulent mais je m'en bats les reins

Boy I ain't need nothing from you
Just your loyalty
And damn it's crazy
Cause you couldn't even give that to me

Boy let's be trill
You don't deserve a real bitch like me
Steady curving niggas left to right
And this how you do me

Had to forget who you fuckin with
Don't act like you don't know
That I'm that bitch
Pretty face, a slim waist
Boy you know that I'm the shit
Ride or die

She cooks and cleans
Got her own and stay on fleek
Pussy wet and tight
Boy you won't find another bitch like me

You had the baddest
On your side
Baby you couldn't hold it down
See I was down to ride
Fuck it
That shit is over now

Chasing another nigga bitch
When all these niggas
Want yo bitch
Boy you stupid
How you sleep on me like this

I told you not to sleep on me (sleep, sleep)
I warned you not to sleep on me (sleep, sleep)
I told you not to sleep on me (sleep, sleep)
I warned you not to sleep on me
Boy you sleep on me, you tweak on me

I'm 22, and I ain't met a nigga that I need
I told you, you ain't got too many times to play with me
Guess you ain't know
Just what you had
Til I decide to leave

You should've known
Cause your own niggas tried to get at me
I'm far from average and see you done got too comfortable

Anyone can't have this
It's a privilege just to fuck me dude

Said I'm done being your fool
The last time was the last time
Boy I'm done playing these games
With you

You had the baddest
On your side
Baby you couldn't hold it down
See I was down to ride

Fuck it! That shit is over now
Chasing another nigga bitch
When all these niggas want yo bitch
Boy you stupid
How you sleep on me like this

I told you not to sleep on me (Sleep, sleep)
I warned you not to sleep on me (Sleeps, sleep)
Boy you sleep on me

I told you not to sleep on me (Sleep, sleep)
I warned you not to sleep on me (Sleep, sleep)
Boy you sleep on me
You tweak on me (Sleep, sleep)

Uhhhh, yeahhh naaa

Tu y yo envueltos en una nube de humo
Mientras tu cuerpo me consumo
De ser el mejor no presumo
Pero cuando te doy tu te sientes en saturno
Que bueno que llego la hora
De que tu y yo estemos a solas
Se que tu te sientes sola
Quiero comerte esa... (Ehmmr)
Y hacer un party con tu cola

Sabio el que dijo que lo facil no iba llegar donde mi
Yo que cogi tanta lucha
Y ahora te tengo encima de mi

Sabes que yo quiero llevarte
Pa' hacerte encima de mi cama
Ninguno lo hace como yo (ohhh)
Truquitos que la enamoran
Quiere que la ponga de espalda
Yo se que su hombre soy yo (ohhh)


El nene

Dime donde tengo que buscarte
Dime si te gusta cuando te como tu parte
Baby te lo hago y es pa' enamorarte
Y ponte bonita aunque vaya a desnudarte
Me compre un OG pa' que te la fumes de la buena
Cuando tenga monchi te como de cena
Se lo meto y me dejo puesta la cadena
Como actor de porno la mato en toa' la escena

Hoy despues del concierto, voy a darte
Hagamoslo donde siempre, no te tarde
Dile al estupido de tu ex, que se guarde
Que me coja una par de vakeros y no se me baile
(Yeeeehh)


Sabio el que dijo, que lo facil
No iba a llegar a donde mi
Yo que cogi tanta lucha
Y ahora te tengo encima de mi

Sabes que yo quiero llevarte
Pa' hacerte encima de mi cama
Ninguno lo hace como yo (ohhh)
Truquitos que la enamoran
Quiere que la ponga de espalda
Yo se que su hombre soy yo (ohhh)


Ya no me puedes reemplazar
Empieza y no puedo parar
No deje de mirarme a los ojos cuando te lo vaya a entrar
Por mi, ella esta faltando a la universidad

Baby
Contigo lo gasto como en navidad
En los momentos que tu sales ella me llama
En la poxima semana nos vamos de rersort
No se si me quiere o solo son ganas
Por como me lo hace es que la llevo al mall

Hoy despues del concierto, voy a darte
Hagamoslo donde siempre, no te tarde
Dile al estupido de tu ex, que se guarde
Que me coja una par de vakeros y no se me baile

Bien sabes que nadie, te lo hace como yo
Yo no te hago el sexo, yo te hago el amor
Pero dime quien te lo hace como yo
Como yo se lo meti, nadie se lo hace mejor(ok)


Sabes que yo quiero llevarte
Pa' hacerte encima de mi cama
Ninguno lo hace como yo (ohhh)
Truquitos que la enamoran
Quiere que la ponga de espalda
Yo se que su hombre soy yo (ohhh)

Now, the prodigal son was a forward child, his mind was not to obey
But after he left his father's house he thought he had gone astray

I believe that, I believe that I will go back home
I believe that, I believe that I will go back home
I believe that, I believe that I will go back home
And be a servant of the Lord

His father saw him coming he met him with a smile
He threw his arms around him saying this is my darling child

I believe that, I believe that I will go back home
I believe that, I believe that I will go back home
I believe that, I believe that I will go back home
And be a servant of the Lord

The father asked the prodigal, son, why you've been gone so long?
One day you sold out the world and forget your happy home
The prodigal said, I searched for true religion, but no faith and no peace could I find
Until I came to a little place called Bakersfield, that eased my troublin' mind

I believe that, I believe that I will go back home
I believe that, I believe that I will go back home
I believe that, I believe that I will go back home
And be a servant of the Lord

I wandered into a tavern where a music band was playin'
The steel guitar rang out so sweet, I feel like I was prayin'
And I asked a comely waitress, is this a new teaching
She said there is no God but God, and Ralph Mooney is his name
I said, let me empty your ashtray, Mr. Mooney, if the drunks interfere I'll be sad
But just as long as you sit there on the bandstand and play your guitar like Buddha, I'll be glad
The father asked the prodigal, did you smell the sweet perfume and hear the angel band?
He said, dim lights, thick smoke, and loud, loud music is the only kind of truth I'll ever understand

I believe that, I believe that I will go back home
I believe that, I believe that I will go back home
I believe that, I believe that I will go back home
And be a servant of the Lord
...
---------------------------------------------------
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Did you find what you're looking for
Since you walked out that door

You want it all back from me
You're running right back to me
You want it all back 'cause you're alone
You want it all back from me
You're running right back to me
You take it all back 'cause you were wrong

I know what you've gone through babe
No one to control you, babe
When I tried to hold you, babe
You would try to slip away
Now you want, you want that old thing back
But I don't, don't wanna hold you back
Thought I told, I thought I told you that
Now you wanna hit my line up saying

Love me, love me, love me
You said I want you to love me like you never did before
But I don't love you no more

You want it all back from me
You're running right back to me
You want it all back 'cause you're alone
You want it all back from me
You're running right back to me
You take it all back 'cause you were wrong

And you can't deny it
You don't have to hide it
You don't love me, nah nah nah
---------------------------------------------------

Faut des pesos, faut des dineros
Pour etre comme nous il faut charbonner


Gang !
Que des trafiquants, que des trafiquantes
T'es en manque de quoi ? On va t'alimenter
Vous faites pas de benef', vous vous la racontez
J'blesse, j'recupere (hey), comme N'Golo Kante
Un peu d'pesos, et j'me barre de la
Crible de balles tu seras si tu parles mon gars
C'est la tempete qu'on met quand y'a la policia
Devant l'arme russe, faut pas parler chinois


Implique dans ce genre de chose
Nous on pense a fond, jamais de pause
Donc c'est rien, on te fait la peau
Parlons pas business si toi meme t'es pauvre
Ton rain-te tourne pas t'es un tho-my
Ca sert a rien qu'tu joue les Tony
A mon avis, c'est mieux tu vas t'chercher un job oui
J'voudrais avoir le benef' et la copine a Pablo
Ton rain-te il tourne pas, ca fait des chromes, ah ouais c'est chaud
J'voudrais avoir le benef' et la copine a Pablo
Ton rain-te il tourne pas, ca fait des chromes, ah ouais c'est chaud


On est des freres, mais c'est chacun son cartel
Tu veux nous approcher, tu vas tres vite t'ecarter
Ils veulent la guerre ? Y'a pas d'soucis on va s'les faires
On va s'les faire, tu crois qu'on va s'laisser faire ?

Weird times
It's a fantasy
All you read in the magazines

Mother Nature in a top hat
(Baby you're the one you can walk the walk)

But they don't realize
Sitting tight
In the compound
Sweatpants, sipping on a cocktail
(Baby you're the one you can walk the walk)

He's got a finger on the button
Ready to delete

I'm through looking out at the darkness
But don't get hypnotized by the lies
It's all gonna crumble under you
Like when the wall came down
And there were no sides

But I'm in a time of separation
Paralysed by our own nation
Blurred lines, another war game
(Baby you're the one you can walk the walk)

Hook, line and sinker
Back at the compound
All the lions start circling
The next man playing out his fantasy
(Baby you're the one you can walk the walk)

(Baby you're the one you can walk the walk)

(Baby you're the one you can walk the walk)

I'm through looking out at the darkness
Don't get hypnotized by the lies
And I don't see them wonder
'Cause when it comes around
It's gonna be too late, too late

We're stuck looking out at the darkness
But don't get hypnotized by the lies
It's all gonna crumble under you
Like when the wall came down
And there were no sides

Ok

(Baby you're the one you can walk the walk)

Walk the walk

(Baby you're the one you can walk the walk)

(Baby you're the one you can walk the walk)

It's Christmastime I'm coming home
After a year of living through the telephone
Please tell the kids, I miss them so
Only in photographs I see them grow

Price that we pay, I've been away for far too long
Hours are heavy, they drag on and on
What keeps me going, what keeps me strong
Think of you and me, awake at dawn

On Christmas Day

All in for love and we're not alone
I can't believe another year's gone
We make the best of life and go on
It's Christmastime, and I'm coming home

Working my way through lonely days
Not where I want to be, but it pays
Means to an end, these seeds we've sown
Put up the decorations on your own

Making our way for Christmas Day

All in for love and we're not alone
I can't believe another year's gone
We make the best of life and go on
It's Christmastime, and I'm coming home
It's Christmastime, and I'm coming home

I'm holding out for that silent night
Where all is calm and everything is bright
You and me by the fireside
We're half asleep and I'm holding you tight

Snowfall and peace with me outside
All night to find the stars are shining bright
It'll be worth the wait in gold
All that we are and everything we know

I'm coming home

All in for love and we're not alone
I can't believe another year's gone
So make the best of life and go on
It's Christmastime, and I'm coming home
It's Christmastime, and I'm coming home
---------------------------------------------------
Yeah yeah yeah, I told these niggas last year I was comin'. Told these niggas I was coming nigga

---------------------------------------------------
Tired of being away, tryna stay awake
When I think that you will always know
That's where you go
It's just where you and I go

Try to write this song in another town
In the backseat of this train
You say that I'm insane
Maybe I am and I don't know

Yeah I'm gonna let it burn
'Cause I'm gonna let it burn
Yeah I'm gonna let it burn
All my days, good things don't come
To those who wait
Yeah I'm gonna let it burn

Tired of being away, tryna stay awake
When I think that you will always know
That's where we go
It's just where you and I go

So when you're worried that you're burning out
And your friends don't know what you're talking 'bout
You say your candle's gonna burn out

Yeah I'm gonna let it burn
'Cause I'm gonna let it burn
Yeah I'm gonna let it burn
All my days, good things don't come
To those who wait
Yeah I'm gonna let it burn

When my head was down my mama told me
To take some time to get out in the rain
And as I blamed it all, no caution to the wind
Blowing hard to keep this happening

'Cause I'm gonna let it burn
Yeah I'm gonna let it burn
All my days, good things don't come
To those who wait
Yeah I'm gonna let it burn

You turn me on like a faucet
And you left me running, drip, drip
'Till my fossil fuels were exhausted
You filled your cup to the tip

Flowers cannot bloom without precipitation
And lovers will not last without reciprocation

You took your box of matches
And you chopped down every stick
I kept you warm 'till I was ashes
Who taught you how to love like this?

Rivers cannot move without precipitation
And love is bound to fail without reciprocation

Well, you turn me on like a faucet
And you left me running, drip, drip
'Till my fossil fuels were exhausted
You filled your cup to the tip
---------------------------------------------------
I don't know where I'm going
Don't know where I came from
I don't know if that's the sun or the shining of a hand gun
I don't if racing down the road I'm taking is leading to a cliff
Or a subway station
I might need a doctor might need to be a patient
All I'm saying

Only thing for certain
Is there ain't no sure thing
No one knows what lurking
Well back behind that curtain
No, no, no there ain't no way of knowing
Everyday, everyday, everyday
Is a leap of faith

Shot from a shot glass bottle or a cannon
I gotta hold on tight just might feel abandoned
Rich man, poor man
Any man, woe man
My man, your man
Beating down the door man
Waking on the floor at four in the morning
But take it as I want it

Only thing for certain
Is there ain't no sure thing
No one knows what lurking
Well back behind that curtain
No, no, no there ain't no way of knowing
Everyday, everyday, everyday
Is a leap of faith

I don't know where I'm going
Don't know where I came from
Might shave my head set it on like a kingdom

Only thing for certain
Is there ain't no sure thing
No one knows what lurking
Well behind that curtain
No, no, no there ain't no way of knowing
Everyday, everyday, everyday
Is a leap of faith

Big on the night
I'm totally big on the night
It's a complex destination
Because it ends in resurrection
I'm so sorry that there's nothing there, but it's sung in the light
Two time winners would've been alone
Gonna cry
Every day

Dudes who rain on innocence
It's around time time fools done pay their respects
And your heart, never brighter than light

Episode!
Show me another one

And it's gonna gotta turn into a baby
And it's gonna gotta why? because to save me
In a tunnel of love

I had the play
Peace with me

I would attest
Peace with me
I would attack
Peace with me

Big on the night
I only go with the night
To daunt the play's donation
And await the resurrection
It's so silly that there's nothing there, but it's sung in the light
Two time winners would've been alone
Gonna cry
Every day

Two times there and no recess
It's around time time school time play on this mess
And your heart, in the manner of now

Episode!
Show me another one

C'est Remy

Maman, je n'veux pas dormir
Ne me quitte pas, ne me quitte pas
Maman, je n'veux pas dormir
Ne me quitte pas, ne me quitte pas

He, j'ai ton sang dans mes veines (ouais)
J'suis ton prince, t'es ma reine (ouais)
Ce son, il est pour toi
Il est pas pour ces ch...
Pardonner, pardonner, tu m'as trop pardonne, t'as fini par m'donner (ouh)
Moi, j'faisais l'etonne parce que d'habitude, j'avais jamais c'que j'voulais
Maman, j'sais pas pour nous comment ca va finir mais avant, j'veux plus voir tes pleurs, que ton sourire
Pour l'instant, j'ai vu des larmes par centaines, si j'fais des efforts pour grandir c'est parce que j't'aime (bah ouais)
J'vois qu'les annees passent et tu t'rapproches deja de la cinquantaine (eh eh)
J'vois qu'les annees passent et j'vous que papa a deja la cinquantaine
Enfermes dans un HLM, quand y'a pas l'ascenseur, tu prends l'escalier (putain)
Tu t'bousilles la sante, tu marches partout, pourtant, l'bonheur est sous tes pieds
Pas d'prix pour ton beau sourire, quand tu vois la facture, j'veux plus ton soupir
Toi, t'es pas comme ces racistes, toi, tu cohabites car aimer, c'est s'unir
(ne me quitte pas)
On connait que Lidl car vide est le portefeuille (on connait que Lidl car vide est le portefeuille)
La vie, c'est une pute depuis qu'on d'vient un homme par le deuil
(ne me quitte pas)
Moi, j'veux m'en sortir car je jure que j'ai commence avec rien
J'pense pas a demain, aujourd'hui, t'es avec moi, donc partons loin

Maman, je n'veux pas dormir
Ne me quitte pas, ne me quitte pas
On a du ch'min, c'est encore loin
Maman, je n'veux pas dormir
Ne me quitte pas, ne me quitte pas
On a du ch'min, c'est encore loin
Maman, je n'veux pas dormir
Ne me quitte pas, ne me quitte pas
On a du ch'min, c'est encore loin
Je n'veux pas dormir
Ne me quitte pas, ne me quitte pas
On a du ch'min, c'est encore loin

Maman, t'es la meilleure, meme si tu me criais dessus tous les quarts d'heure
L'argent, donne a ta mere, elle t'a donne la vie, ca vaut plus que tout l'or
Elle te dit "reste avec moi" et toi tu fais que d'lui dire "ouais, ouais, 'taleur"
Et quand tu claques la te-por, tu t'rends meme pas compte de son malheur
Maman, j'sais pas pour nous comment ca va finir, mais avant, j'veux plus voir tes pleures, que tes fossettes
J'ai travaille, travaille dur, et pour voir ton sourire, j'crois que j'ai trouve la recette
Dans l'couloir, tu trepasses a 6 du mat' et j'viens d'commencer ma nuit
Et moi, j'viens d'commencer ma vie, toi, tu travailles depuis pres de 26 piges
On a vecu dans HLM, meme pas d'argent pour aller chez H&M
Tu m'remettais ma couverture, donc dans le livre de ma vie, bah, tu s'ras mon theme
Mieux vaut marcher que courir : si tu prends le temps, y'aura plus de souvenirs
Et j'rigolais un peu plus quand j'pensais que papa pouvait encore rev'nir
(ne me quitte pas)
J'pense qu'a aujourd'hui, car hier, c'est l'passe, demain, c'est loin
J'veux qu'tes yeux voient de beau horizons et pas de sales coins
(ne me quitte pas)
J'suis tetu en amour, mais pour toi, j'pourrais jamais l'etre
Jamais j'aimerai une femme plus que celle qui m'a fait naitre

Maman, je n'veux pas dormir
Ne me quitte pas, ne me quitte pas
On a du ch'min, c'est encore loin
Maman, je n'veux pas dormir
Ne me quitte pas, ne me quitte pas
On a du ch'min, c'est encore loin
Maman, je n'veux pas dormir
Ne me quitte pas, ne me quitte pas
On a du ch'min, c'est encore loin
Je n'veux pas dormir
Ne me quitte pas, ne me quitte pas
On a du ch'min, c'est encore loin
---------------------------------------------------
It's been awhile since we've spoken
It's hard to find words to say
Cause all we got left in common
Is how long we been this way

Remember when I left your city
Remember when we had that talk
I made sure that I woke up early
I never missed your call

Been a while since we've spoken
Ashamed of how long it takes
To say what I'm sure you've noticed
The anger might never fade

But don't worry
We can't hurry
It's gonna take some time
To unravel
This state of mind

After everything we say
All we do is hesitate
To learn to love each other
To learn to love each other

Even though we separate
It's never gonna be too late
To learn to love each other
To learn to love each other

It's been awhile since we've spoken
I'm not sure where to go from here
Cause I don't wanna not say something
But I don't wanna live with fear

I'm scared of what you're withholding
I'm scared of what I might say
I know that we're worth the struggle
And love can outlast the pain

But don't worry
We can't hurry
It's gonna take some time
To unravel
This state of mind

After everything that we say
All we do is hesitate
To learn to love each other
To learn to love each other

Even though we separate
It's never gonna be too late
To learn to love each other
To learn to love each other

After everything that we say
All we do is hesitate
To learn to love each other
To learn to love each other

Even though we separate
It's never gonna be too late
To learn to love each other
To learn to love each other
---------------------------------------------------
I said goodbye
But I still feel you deep inside me
Turn off the lights
Cold sweat from my aching body
Footsteps crawling all up the staircase
Trace one finger down my spine
Everyone thinks that I'm pretending
Both of us know I'm paralyzed
Try to lock you out

I feel you in my dreams
You're everywhere, you won't go easily
I see you in my sleep
So I'm wide awake to keep you far from me
I keep sleepwalking just to breathe
I feel you in my dreams
You're everywhere
The only remedy is sleepwalking

I don't know why
I keep hanging from the ceiling
Millionth time
I've tried so hard but you just won't leave me
Try lock you out

I feel you in my dreams
You're everywhere, you won't go easily
I see you in my sleep
So I'm wide awake to keep you far from me
I keep sleepwalking just to breathe
I feel you in my dreams
You're everywhere
The only remedy is sleepwalking

I'll give in tonight to this lullaby
You said: "Baby, don't you cry"
I can't escape and I can't erase
It's taking over me
Turn off the lights

I feel you in my dreams
You're everywhere, you won't go easily
I see you in my sleep
So I'm wide awake to keep you far from me
I keep sleepwalking just to breathe
I feel you in my dreams
You're everywhere
The only remedy is sleepwalking

I feel you in my dreams
Sleepwalking
I feel you in my dreams
Sleepwalking

Switcharoo, call it alley-oop, she gettin' thrown out
D to the S so you know the streets sold now
Rob him for his beat so you know this bitch a stole now
Silly rabbit, them ain't real karats, take them golds out


Ran down on him, oh wait, but this bitch stop
I ain't from the north but I gotta keep a pole got
Hollow stole hot, fuck a clique, I want an empire
Youngin from the drive, bend the curb, you need lots of iron
Still be smoke, I'm blowin', jit don't fuckin' choke
Whack a duck, if the pistol tryna quack it up
Mercedes truck, one-sixty, that bitch ain't fast enough
Bend your block, like a trashcan we gon' dump


If it's smoke in the city with my niggas, better call it out
We buckin' too just like the chopper, we flingin' buckshots
Red bitch, she gon' fuck the city 'til she fucked out
Cougar bitch, she gon' suck a nigga 'til I'm sucked out
I'm up now, I don't really give a fuck now
We hit for ten bands, I don't know, I might just buck now
Cold world, we givin' cold cuts, you might get cut now
We all in the field like down, get set, hut now


Rottweilers, 'til you babies ask for wahwah
I was servin' molly rocks, finessin' out the wahwah
I'm just tryna hit, DB stabbed this bitch, haha
I really like Carmelo Anthony's bitch, yeah, LaLa
Robbed the boy and made him walk home in his damn socks
Yeah I came from shit, lot of shell catchers and headshots
Red dots, made the pussy wish he never ever tried
Bless not, shots from the nine made the rest stop


Fresh out of the juvie, hit the booth and now I'm bootin' up
Late nights makin' powerplays, they got me shootin' up
Had to rob the pussy 'cause the fuck nigga was gook as fuck
Maneuver all around these hoes, they wanna move with us
Leave the nigga that you with, I know he turned you off
Put a nigga on then a pussy wanna turn you off
All my niggas in for the win, we never took a loss
Dead flies on the beat so I told Teezy to turn it off
---------------------------------------------------
You only make time if it's time for yourself
I'm sick of leaving my heart up on a shelf
How could you kiss me with the mouth of a snake?
I feel the poison making my body shake, yeah

You fucked around and then you threw me away
I won't keep fighting yeah I've made that mistake
I need to grab my keys and go for a ride
I'd rather have this empty seat by my side, yeah

So don't come waiting
Waiting at my door
I only answer
When the night is calling
And don't be ringing
Won't pick up no more
I only answer
When the night is calling
Calling
Calling
Calling

I close my eyes and it's still you in my bed
I need to drink your body out of my head
So kiss the tail lights as they fade into black
I'm leaving town and I'm not ever looking back

So don't come waiting
Waiting at my door
I only answer
When the night is calling
And don't be ringing
Won't pick up no more
I only answer
When the night is calling
Calling
Calling
Calling

Yeah you cheated and you lied
So don't come crawling back this time
I know you're calling from outside
But I don't hear, I don't hear, I don't no no

So don't come waiting
Waiting at my door
I only answer
When the night is calling
And don't be ringing
Won't pick up no more
I only answer
When the night is calling
Calling
Calling
Calling

Yo they're saying I'm a star, there's no turning back
But I'm finding it hard to stop serving packs
Yo these niggas ain't real, and I'm learning that
Start talking like some hoes, when she turned your back
I fuck with that, we're in these streets
And you'd think she was the feds, how she's into me
Yo I'm Fred, I turn 28s into 3
And my diamonds turn dinner dates into freaks
Pussy

I heard you wanna come to my shows
But my visits in jail, you weren't coming to those
3 3 smoke that's my youngen on go
And this chain round my neck, cost me hundreds of O's
When it was time to ride, you was always in your crib
When it was time to ride, I was always in the whip
A 9 bar of benzocaine is always in the brick
That's a mortgage on my wrist
She's fucking bummy niggas, I ain't talking to the chick
In Nobu with my nigga, like I'm ordering the shrimp
We used to have no place to go, it's pouring on the strip
Now you can't find a man my age that's saucing on the kid
Yo, of couse I'm gonna win
And if you grew up in hell, then of course you're gonna sin
When I put the prezzie on my wrist, you're talking to a king
Every month I have a boxing walking the ring
And my pinky's nearly ready it's like water in the ring

Yo they're saying I'm a star, there's no turning back
But I'm finding it hard to stop serving packs
Yo these niggas ain't real, and I'm learning that
Start talking like some hoes, when she turned your back
I fuck with that, we're in these streets
And you'd think she was the feds, how she's into me
Yo I'm Fred, I turn 28s into 3
And my diamonds turn dinner dates into freaks
Pussy

30 points on my pinky ring, yeah it's glistening
Started rapping last year, now everybody's listening
We step up in Harrods, and stress up the badders
Young niggas like me might mess up your marriage
I'm all on my block, cos we're all that we got
Gotta order my watch, and it's pouring with rocks
We been touring a lot
So shouts to the fans, cos they're riding as well
Came a long way from fighting in jail
Rough nights, grinding was hell
She's up on my insta, liking as well
I think she wan buss it, but timing will tell
I flex in the hood and I'm violent as well
So I'm dodging these bitches, Trident as well
No slipping up
Bro's in the kitchen, and bro's whipping up
At first it was hard, there was no giving up
So I fly to the Shard just to show I'm a star

Yo they're saying I'm a star, there's no turning back
But I'm finding it hard to stop serving packs
Yo these niggas ain't real, and I'm learning that
Start talking like some hoes, when she turned your back
I fuck with that, we're in these streets
And you'd think she was the feds, how she's into me
Yo I'm Fred, I turn 28s into 3
And my diamonds turn dinner dates into freaks
Pussy

Took a trip out to the A they told me I'm the one
Shit's just crazy dawg, 'cause where I'm from, it's selling drugs and toting guns
So sick of seeing insufficient funds
Gotta get the gwuap, so all my dawgs can stop making them daily runs
I pray for change, but never see a cent
And that nine to five just ain't gon' cut it, that shit barely pay the rent
Guess it's right back to the streets again
And they wonder why these people out here end up dead, or end up in the pen
Hard to stay away from easy money, when you know the plug
Counting up these dirty dollars, bitch I'm from the mud
Ain't shit sweet around here dawg, I grew up in the bando
They cut the power off, we lighting candles
It made me who I am, though, gotta get these bands, bro
Gotta feed my fam though
Don't try to take what's mine, bitch, I got lots of ammo
Ain't got no fucking time for these suckers, I might just send my youngin's to have you handled

Fuck 'em if they hatin', I'ma get this shit regardless
Fuck 'em if they hatin', I'ma get this shit regardless
Fuck 'em if they hatin', I'ma get this shit regardless

That's how it goes
That's how it goes
That's how it goes
Bitch, that's how it goes


I'ma get this shit regardless, I ain't gon' let up
Every nigga claim they with you gon' get wet up
I'm so tired of this shit, you gon' say I'm fed up
Now they know me at the bank, I got my bread up, real stuff
Turn into an addict, I've been drinking raw lean
Brand new dually truck I set it on some Forgi's
Niggas talkin' down tellin' ho's they gon' rob me
I ain't worried, I won't go for nothing
I keep Tiger in the cut ready to go now it's time
Hear 'em talkin' down but I don't believe they gotta show us
Just tell me where I can't go, I guarantee I'll show up
Never said I was the bomb, but push the button, I'm gon' blow up


Fuck 'em if they hatin', I'ma get this shit regardless
Yeah I ride with savages, them motherfuckers heartless
Don't get in the way of a scene 'cause we starvin'
Yeah
Ayy
Fuck 'em if they hatin', I'ma get this shit regardless
Yeah I ride with savages, them motherfuckers heartless
Don't get in the way of a scene 'cause we starvin'

I've been riding around Saturn's rings
Learning how each one sings
Jumping from star to star
Finding my own heart

I've been learning to slow down
Putting roots in that ground
Waiting until that fruit is ripe
Growing up in that light

Sunshine through my window
She's coming home tomorrow
It's my choice to be joyful
Giving up all sorrow

This is my story
This is my vision
Everything right on time

Well I'm hearing Jupiter's Call
Got me feeling strong and tall
Laughing at the play of life
Giving me a brand new sight

The war between right and wrong
I'm putting it all in song
And trust that I do my best
Letting my body rest

Sunshine through my window
She's coming home tomorrow
It's my choice to be joyful
Giving up all sorrow

This is my story
This is my vision
Everything right on time

Sunshine through my window
She's coming home tomorrow
It's my choice to be joyful
Giving up all sorrow

This is my story
This is my vision
Everything right on time
---------------------------------------------------
Most when it's almost like a bane
You arrive like a siren refrain
Like death, she takes everything
And dazes me like patent medicine
Into this strange divine
The road was serpentine
A network of silken threads
Spider's trapping web
Makes me rue the day

You became my pain killer
I rue the day
Alright, alright, alright

Praying at the altar of your legs and feet
Your saliva is a drug so bittersweet
I'll arrogate what's there to take
In an evanescent embrace
Anesthetic liaison
Honey honey you're my medication
Like love, you take everything
And this static yearn
Makes me rue the day

You became my pain killer
I rue the day
Alright, alright, alright

Strange divine
Strange divine
Strange divine

I rue the day
You became my pain killer
I rue the day
Alright, alright, alright
I rue the day
You became my pain killer
I rue the day
Alright, alright, alright
You became my pain killer
You became my pain killer
---------------------------------------------------
Driving in my beat up car
Too broke to go very far
Some days I just wanna feel ya
Other days I wanna kill ya
Higher than no other love
Safer than no other drug
If you wanna tell me something
Call me, call me, call me, call me

It all takes time
You don't take time
Everything takes time
It takes time to learn

Yeah, yeah yeah
Call me up again
Yeah, yeah yeah
Call me up again

Thinking on the things I lost
Wrote it down but I still forgot
All the shit I swore I'd remember
Everyone's getting back together
And I wish I could but I just left town
I'll hit you up when I'm back around
You bring me higher than no other love
Safer than no other drug
If you wanna tell me something
Call me, call me, call me, call me

It all takes time
You don't take time
Everything takes time
It takes time to learn

Well, hello my lonely roller coaster
I'm comin' up so please scoot over
Call my sister, call my mom
Call my girlfriend, call the cops
Shut off the world I can't let go
All the shit I think I know
When I am right but I am wrong
You have loved me all along
When I am right but I am wrong
You have loved me all along

Driving in my beat up car
Too broke to go very far
Some days I just wanna feel ya
Other days I wanna kill ya
Higher than no other love
Safer than no other drug
If you wanna tell me something
Call me, call me, call me, call me

Let your body move
Let your body move, yeah

Get on your feet, just get up and dance

Day and night.
What, what?
I toss and turn, I keep stressing my mind, mind.
What, what?
I look for peace but see I don't attain.
What, what?
What I need for keeps this silly game we play, play.
Now look at this—what, what?—madness.
The magnet keeps attracting me, me.
What, what?
I try to run but see I'm not that fast.
What, what?
I think I'm first but surely finish last, last.


'Cause day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night

The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, at, at, at night.
Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night

The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone, some things will never change, never change.
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, at, at, at night


Hold the phone.
What, what?
The lonely stoner, Mr. Solo Dolo.
What, what?
He's on the move can't seem to shake the shade.
What, what?
Within his dreams he sees the life he made, made.
The pain is deep.
What, what?
A silent sleeper you won't hear a peep, peep.
What, what?
The girl he wants don't seem to want him too.
What, what?
It seems the feelings that she had are through, through




Slow mo.
What, what?
When the tempo slows up and creates that new, new.
What, what?
He seems alive though he is feeling blue.
What, what?
The sun is shining. Man, he's super cool, cool
The lonely nights.
What, what?
They fade away he slips into his white Nikes.
What, what?
He smokes a clip and then he's on the way.
What, what?
To free his mind in search of—
To free his mind in search of—
To free his mind in search of—



At, at, at night
---------------------------------------------------
We stare through new horizons
Watch the waves keep crashing in
Light the fire that you breathe in

Under the stars we're sailing
High seas keep rolling on
Through the mist so far from home

But I'm not alone
So let the sunshine in
Don't get lost, don't give in
So let the sunshine in

So let's go walking in the sand
(Let's go walking in the sand)
Don't let time slip through your hands
Yes, I've been in love before
But this time's gold and that's for sure
It's gold, it's gold

So I watch you for hours
Just let the night sink in
With shadows dancing 'round my skin
Some people call them nightmares
I take my mind's astray
Whenever darkness clouds my days

But I'm not alone
So let the sunshine in
Don't get lost, don't give in
So let the sunshine in

So let's go walking in the sand
(Let's go walking in the sand)
Don't let time slip through your hands
Yes, I've been in love before
But this time's gold and that's for sure
It's gold, it's gold

So harmonize your feelings
Keep holding on my heart's reeling
Falling like dominoes
Facing up to the sky
Looking out for a sign

clouds will part

This is gold you know
Cause we've seen gold before
I found the treasure now I've got to keep holding on
And maybe this is the time
For us to give it a try
And if we never lose hope maybe our love survives

So let's go walking in the sand
(Let's go walking in the sand)
Don't let time slip through your hands
(Don't let time slip through your hands)
So let's go walking in the sand
(Let's go walking in the sand)
Don't let time slip through your hands
Yes, I've been in love before
But this time's gold and that's for sure
It's gold, it's gold

J'pense a mon futur, au mektoub
J'pense a mes potos, j'pense a tout
Lunettes teintees car j'ai les yeux rouges
Lunettes teintees car j'ai les yeux rouges
J'pavane seul-tout, longue est la route
On penave, Samba m'dit "lache rien baise tout"
J'prends sur moi j'dis rien mais je sais tout
Juste j'attend l'bon moment pour en decoudre
T'etais l'sang maintenant j'te vois en che-lou
Fais pas l'fou on sait qu'au fond toi t'es cool
J'ai la touffe papa veut que j'fais la boule
J’appelle ta racli que pour faire la bouffe
Elle est la pour l'rap mais j'm'en bas les couilles
Ses nattes se demelent quand j'lui mets des coups
Quoi qu'il arrive j'me batterai toujours
Un vaillant n'a pas peur d'manger des coups
J'm'en rappelle les mecs quand on retournait tout
Helico, giro, y'en avait partout
Pour revenir au passe moi j'donnerai tout
Pour revenir au passe moi j'donnerai tout


Trafic de me-ca, trafique de me-ar
Du dore, du dore planque dans le placard
Igo tout est noir, j'suis perdu dans l'brouillard
Le Smith & Wesson va trouer tous ces trouillard
Tu veux du produit rentre dans 'laboratoire
Y'a C-max a l'affut et l'guetteur crie ca passe
Pose sur l'terrain j'attend les mapessa
Y'a mon gars Dalsim qui fait des plavant carna'
Toi ca va t'fumer en Clio trois
Trois keume unis d'une kalash comme *****
Dans les che-po pilons couleur ananas
J'ai les yeux rouge mon demon refait surface
Dans le pochtars y'a la frappe de Marc Landers
Dans le pochtars y'a la frappe de Marc Landers
J'vais t'niquer tes morts si tu touches nos p'tites soeurs
C'est Djeffi Ck-Ja maintenant gros c'est mon heure


Toujours des haineux qui veulent pas qu'on avance
J'pense a tout, j'pense a nous, a notre enfance
J't'ai laisse d'l'avance mais quand meme j'te devance
C'est l'travail qui paie, pas la triche ni la chance
La concu' derriere ne suit pas la cadence
C'est Tiako la melo' qui mene bien la danse
Parlons business mais comment on s’arrange ?
Six chiffres dans l'c-sa comme ca on s'arrange
J'te fais du sale a la minute (hey)
Pour faire du sale faudrait qu'tu luttes
Le bigo sonne toutes les minutes (yah)
C'est pas la daronne mais ta copine
Elle m'a pris pour un salop (salop)
Donc j'l'ai pris pour une salope (salope)
Comme Pablo j'veux son seille-o
Comme Pablo j'veux son seille-o

24hrs
What happened last night?
(Might as well light the wood)
'Cause


to Atlanta that's a hour
Kick it at your condo watchin' Power
Back massage when I hop up out the shower
When you say my name, you gotta say it louder

You should you beautiful
When you climbin' up that striper pole
You should you beautiful
When you comin' down that striper pole

Ass on you like Magic City
But you don't work at Magic
Girl you got that magic
Let 24 have it

You should you beautiful
When you climbin' up that striper pole
You should you beautiful
When you comin' down that striper pole

I drop you off, you late for work (damn)
You fuck with me don't gotta work
Your nigga pricey he do the most
He wanna be in all you post
Girl you bad, you could be my Cinderella
We do molly then we head out to Coachella
That new Wraith it came with that new umbrella

You should you beautiful
When you climbin' up that striper pole
You should you beautiful
When you comin' down that striper pole

You should you beautiful
When you climbin' up that striper pole
You should you beautiful
When you comin' down that striper pole

Man this is probably the hardest thing I ever had to do!
And I just wanna be honest with you,
You always said we could talk it out!
So, here it is!

First off, let me see some things,
Gotta clear it out, get out of my chest.
I had a lot of...
But baby girl you're the best!
When we hooked up, you said we'd keep it easy,
But lately is uneasy for me!
We were friends with benefits,
So one day I looked at your facebook status
Saying that your relationship is complicated.
Now what I'm about to say is...
Cause I love you so much!
But I just gotta tell you how I feel girl, honestly!


Maybe it's time that we just move one, move on!
Maybe it's best that we just let it go, let go,
Instead of holding on to something that we both know
... for us, and honestly I am ready to walk away,
But I'll end up hurting more if I stay!
I don't wanna leave!
You don't want me to leave,
But you know that we don't want the same thing.
Honestly, honestly, honestly,
Do we, do we, do we?

Second guess at myself,
Trying to figure out if I play this right.
Got your boy messed up,
She's living here, not without a fight!
Baby... like crazy,.. just looking shady,
I'm just trying to be strong for the both of us, yeah!
You don't understand, but I hope in time you will!
I try to do, do, I've been here! Yea!
And I know what you really need is a man,
The thing is right now, I could only be your friend!
I'm telling you honestly:


Maybe it's time that we just move one, move on!
Maybe it's best that we just let it go, let go,
Instead of holding on to something that we both know
... for us, and honestly I am ready to walk away,
But I'll end up hurting more if I stay!
I don't wanna leave!
You don't want me to leave,
But you know that we don't want the same thing.
Honestly, honestly, honestly,
Do we, do we, do we?
Tell me honestly, do we want the same thing?
Do we, do we, do we?
Honestly, honestly, honestly

Caught in autumn leaves
Grass too tall to see
Oh, I believe in this jungle of mine
Nothing quite like this
These islands in the mist
We got each other, this jungle of mine

Keep our faith in native days
And hope the skyline stays the same

Oh, the days
The wi-ilder days
Come again and take me away
Leavin' in the morning
Come back when I know my way

Wolves, we make a pack
Sun across our backs
When we were children, this jungle of mine
North of Eastern Down
A castle that we found
It never leaves me, this jungle of mine

Keep our faith in native days
And hope the skyline stays the same

Oh, the days
The wi-ilder days
Come again and take me away
Leavin' in the morning
Come back when I know my-
Oh, the days
The wi-ilder days
Come again and take me away
Leavin' in the morning
Come back when I know my way

Don't say a word, say a word
We're free, like the birds, like the birds
Oh, don't say a word, say a word
We're free, like the birds, like the birds
Those were the days we could say, "We're alive"

Oh, the days
The wi-ilder days

Turn the sound down on my TV
I just can't listen any more
It's like I'm in some foreign country
That I've never seen before

So come now here to think about it
What in the hell are we goin to do?
Cause after all is said and all is done
It's just me and you

It's just me and you
And we are definitely outnumbered
There's more of them than us
Just when you think you made a new friend
They throw you under the bus
So it's just me and you
It's just me and you

I had a friend I used to talk to
We used to both sit on the fence
But anymore I can't relate to him
'Cause he ain't got a lick of sense

So now I just ask you the questions
But I'm the one I'm talkin' to
The world has gone out of its mind
Except for me and you

It's just me and you
And we are definitely outnumbered
There's more of them than us
Just when you think you made a new friend
They throw you under the bus
So it's just me and you
It's just me and you
Yeah it's just me and you
---------------------------------------------------
I've seen people holding on to nothing
Broken dreams and broken cords
Running on empty, losing sleep, oh
It's true I've earned these cracks upon my feet

Walk away from all that you know
Walk away and hold your own
Walk away and hold your own

And I've seen people holding on to something
Smiling with no place to call home
In you I see something so familiar, uh
My dear friend, so nice to have you home

And this all seems unreal
Just how far we've come
Look into the mirror
Not sure who I was

Walk away from all that you know
Walk away and hold your own
Walk away from all that you know
Walk away and hold your own

When you bow your head and wonder
Tell me now, will it all become real
Fill me in as I sometimes sit and wonder
Wonder how you may ever find your feet

Walk away
I've seen you holding on to nothing
Walk away
I've seen you holding on to something
Walk away from all that you know
I've seen you holding on to nothing
Walk away and hold your own
I've seen you holding on to something
Walk away and hold your own
And I've seen people holding on to something
---------------------------------------------------
You tell me you're sorry
For letting me down
For letting us down
And these politics are taking over
What you're thinking
And what you're saying

So why don't you call me another time
Why don't you tell me what's in your eyes
So why don't you call me another time
2 am doing another line
So why don't you call me another time
Why don't you tell me what's in your eyes
So why don't you call me another time
Why don't you tell me a couple lies

And all these thrills that we're seeking
All this wine we've been drinking
Don't you think we're too old for the faking
Don't you think so darling
Don't you think so darling
Don't you think so darling

So why don't you call me another time
Why don't you tell me what's in your eyes
So why don't you call me another time
2 am doing another line
So why don't you call me another time
Why don't you tell me what's in your eyes
So why don't you call me another time
Why don't you tell me a couple lies

Why don't you take me
Why don't you take me
Why don't you take me, take me, take me
To your side
To your side
Why don't you take me
Why don't you take me
Why don't you take me, take me, take me
To your side
To your side
Why don't you take me
Why don't you take me
To your side, to your side

I love the rainfall
I love it when you call me
So take my hand now
I'll catch you if you're falling
I promise I'm not going

And I love it when we're talking
Until it's the end of it

But I promise promise there's nothing nothing that can nothing make me go away
If I'm not around not around just know this know this

You can take my jacket to keep you warm

You can take my jacket to keep you warm
I know you like to steal it so I'll come home

I wanna stand in the rain, hold your hand
Forget about everything around me
And say things no one else would understand
I love it cuz they think that we're crazy
I wanna stand in the rain, hold your hand
Forget about everything around me
And say things no one else would understand
I love it cuz they think that we're crazy

You can take my jacket I don't mind
You can take my jacket I don't mind
No I don't no I don't mind
No I don't no I don't
---------------------------------------------------
(Okay!)

You and me
And our bittersweet memories
They never seem to fade away

I've been gone for such a long time
Wouldn't blame you if you left

After all, this world ain't small
But I'll still give you my love
Don't you cry, wonder why
I've given you my trust

I've been gone for such a long time
Wouldn't blame you if you left me
I've been gone for such a long time
Wouldn't blame you if you left

After all, we're bound to fall
So give me all your love

I've been gone for such a long time
Wouldn't blame you if you left me
I've been gone for such a long time
Wouldn't blame you if you left

J'suis avec le zin autour d'une chicha raisin
J'appelle mon cousin, j'lui demande de descendre
Elle a trop tise, elle me fait remarquer
Elle fait que tmeniker, j'lui demande de s'detendre
J'suis sur l'bitume, petit polo Prestance
J'titube, il est 13h petante
J'prends ma petite, j'l'emmene sur un port de Plaisance
Poches remplies, j'profite de ce moment de detente
Tchok a 50, liasses de 50
Ta gadji coute pas cher, meme pas 50
L'argent vient vite, mon cousin, il part vite
La con de sa tante, t'facon j'vais mourir avant 50
L'avenir est a nous faut tout niquer maintenant
Faut tout niquer maintenant
Un peu d'Givenchy, un peu d'Versace
Quelques Lacoste, quelques Lieutenant

A trop faire du sale la street m'en redemande
De quoi tu parles, t'es personne aucune redevance
Tu nous connais, tu connais notre provenance
T'entends parler d'mon equipe dans La Provence
A trop faire du sale la street m'en redemande
De quoi tu parles, t'es personne aucune redevance
Tu nous connais, tu connais notre provenance
T'entends parler d'mon equipe dans La Provence

J'ai change d'voiture
Y a meme pas deux ans ma 'ture coutait meme pas le prix de un d'mes vetements
Retiens qu'une chose, pour nous 70
Tu nous fais l'blinde, tu touches 9%
J'ai grimpe quelques etapes, sans piston
Chicos petes, les yeux petes
J'te vois tourner dans la zone avec ta vieille caisse que ta salope t'a pretee
J'ai la haine, j'ai la haine
Sortir un titre, tourner un clip, frerot, j'ai la flemme
Hier ca tirait devant l'bar
J'suis rentre tard, j'me suis reveille tard
J'recompte ma part, j'fume un petard
J'regarde son petard, frerot j'me regale

A trop faire du sale la street m'en redemande
De quoi tu parles, t'es personne aucune redevance

A trop faire du sale la street m'en redemande
De quoi tu parles, t'es personne aucune redevance
Tu nous connais, tu connais notre provenance
T'entends parler d'mon equipe dans La Provence

T'es qu'un gros mytho
Personne ne te connait dans ton barrio
Au feu ce fou furieux veut qu'on s'tire la bourre
J'suis pas mal emeche, j'veux pas finir a l'Eveche pour un controle de papiers
Des billets eparpilles, tu connais l'equipe, le square est quadrille
Dans la cave j'en ai un, il en reste que deux dans l'barillet
J'aime trop mon tieks, j'passe tout mon temps a faire croquer les minots d'la tess
Quel honneur, j'vois leurs yeux briller

A trop faire du sale la street m'en redemande

I walk past the old veranda
Where grandad sat rocking
He was gazing at the mountains
And he didn't hear me knocking
He smiled as I approached him
Said how's my sonny's boy
The wind was quietly whistling
As he told me of his joy

There's a fortune in those hills
And I'm gonna find it some day
There's a fortune in those hills
And I'm gonna find, it's gonna be mine
I'm gonna find it some way

Picked up his steel string guitar
And started the upward climb
I just quietly followed
Carrying the bread and the wine
We reached a stone and sat awhile
Grandad wiped my brow
He looked at me like a brother
Said, "Boy, it ain't far now"

There's a fortune in those hills
And I'm gonna find it some day
There's a fortune in those hills
And I'm gonna find, it's gonna be mine
I'm gonna find it some way

There's a fortune in that cabin
And granddad knows too well
There's a man in there with long black hair
There's a man you'll never sell

Reached and pushed the door
Pretending we've done right
The face I saw in there
I'll remember all my life
Gripped by cool attraction
Followed where granddad stepped
When I walked inside
Just rats and rust were left

There's a fortune in those hills
And I'm gonna find it some day
There's a fortune in those hills
I'm gonna find, it's gonna be mine
I'm gonna find it some day

There's a fortune in those hills
And I'm gonna find it some day
There's a fortune in those hills
And I'm gonna find, it's gonna be mine
I'm gonna find it some way

Wishing life was counting sheep
All my life is losing sleep
It's all we know
When you saw me first glance did you know that I was cursed?

Wishing life was counting sheep
All my life is losing sleep
It's all we know
When you saw me first glance did you know that I was cursed?

May have not been your intention
To paint me all red and
To change my name
But you unlocked the door
You let them all in and
I've never been the same
Do I haunt your dreams you'll think of what you've done?
Who you've become?
Paint me as you see yourself

Wishing life was counting sheep
All my life is losing sleep
It's all we know
When you saw me first glance did you know that I was cursed?

Wishing life was counting sheep
All my life is losing sleep
It's all we know
When you saw me first glance did you know that I was cursed?

I wish I didn't care what you think
What you'll make them believe about me
You're shallow but still make me sink
Draw blood with my skin on your teeth
(With my skin on your teeth)
I hope you know that I'll be gone for good
My skin it crawls when I think of the serpents grip around my neck
The rope around my neck is tied for good
Indigo blue my last breathe
I hope you know that I spent hours
Fuck
Does the devil really have blue eyes?
Have you ever seen his smile?
Count as hours go by
Eternity trapped in my mind

Wishing life was counting sheep
All my life is losing sleep
It's all we know
When you saw me first glance did you know that I was cursed?

Wishing life was counting sheep
All my life is losing sleep
It's all we know
When you saw me first glance did you know that I was cursed?

It's all we know
When you saw me first glance did you know that I was cursed?

Los ojos bien tumbados y llantita quemando
La Cherokee del diablo la que ando transitando
Ahi traigo un fox bien bravo nomas le falta sayo
En el pison se pierden las llantas en humo blanco
Un relojon brillando, pues duro le he chingado
La Cherokee zumbando, alegre va el muchacho
Una clica de locos, bien grifos andan todos
Bien pilas con El Chino toda la bola de cholos
A gusto ando en la chamba, correteando la papa
Se mira que ya saben como masca la iguana
Los Angeles trabaja, en el norte la pasa
Echando donas en las calles, pintando las llantas

Paramount, California, pa' que sepan mi zona
De morros en el barrio como hicimos historias
Siempre la tira patos en la cintura cargo
Desde morrillo siempre los huevos bien agarrados
Chambeando y pa'delante, no hay nada que quejarse
De morro no habia nada que en mi pueda quebrarse
Positivo en lo mio, mi mente no hay quien cambie
Y nos miramos en un rato otra vez en la calle
Ahora ando en la escuelita y puro pa' Adelita
Si hay algo que me aguita, me abrazan mis chinitas
Saludos a la clica que me apoya de arriba
Las calles de Califas me extranan en la movida
---------------------------------------------------
Pasaron empecherados
a recibir un invitado
lo llevan bien escoltado
por Sonora patrullando
con una sola consigna
cuidenlo mas que su vida

Porta los ojos tumbados
el Chinito es apodado
del barrio de los mojados
logro enclicarse en el charco
en Sonora y Sinaloa
por los jefes respetado

California radicamos
las Carolinas trabajamos
ando pa arriba y pa abajo
es el don que dios me ha dado
hacer costales de verdes
pues bien sabemos gastarlos

Con el berry siempre listo
pal negocio y pal relajo
me la navego fajado
de expansivas retacado
por si brincan algun valiente
casquillos veran volando

Agradecido me encuentro
me cuidan bien el pellejo
el Chinito y Vaquerito
junto al K-74
los plebe sen La Angelina
nunca los dejare abajo

Quemando un gallo entro al viaje
y recordando a mi padre
como me hace falta el viejo
me dio consejos de grandes
algun dia nos miraremos
por lo pronto en paz descanze
---------------------------------------------------
Hoy les cuento de mis gustos les presumo a mis amigos que estimo de mas
No se puede progresar se tiene que laborar
La modilla fue mi escuela hoy soy de buena madera
Ser de agrado mas no ser dejado pero tengo la cabeza para mandar
El cerebro pa ordenar paso firme y sin parar
Gracias a mis amistades ya salimos adelante

Cuando paso a la papeleria tengo ganas de forjar algo verde
El gallo me quita el miedo tambien me quita los nervios
Una super con veneno por que la cosa es encerio

7 dias a la semana 24 horas al dia sonriente yo soy
En la ruta con mis socios que bueno salio el negocio
Viernes hacemos escala destino Guadalajara
En Las Vegas pruebo de mi suerte unos billetes se perder no me aguito
Por que las pacas van dando tambien me paseo en un antro
Si pierdo salgo ganando por que me paseo buen rato

Cuando paso a la papeleria tengo ganas de forjar algo verde
El gallo me quita el miedo tambien me quita los nervios
Una super con veneno por que la cosa es encerio

De la cholada se alejo
Por que asi le fue mucho mejor
Gracias a mi apa y mi ama
La familia siempre va
Por delante pa que nada salga mal

Con ganas de chambear el viejon
En los phoenix un buen tiempo le pego
Luego me empeze a relacionar
A mandados me emperazon a mandar
De mandadero asi me toco empezar

Eran muchas libras de cristal
Las que me tocaba transportar
La chamba nunca me cayo mal
Pero la neta la tuve que cambiar
Yerbita verde me puse a sembrar

Ahora tranquilo surtiendo de verde
Los mercaditos
Super al cinto
Para el peligro
Yo soy sencillo subiendo pa arriba
No veo pa lado
Yo me concentro
En mi trabajo

Empezamos con la venta
Con esa me empeze alivianar
Esa yerbita especial
La sierra me hace ganar
Dolares cuando va a cosechar

Clavado en la sierra donde esta
Cada tres meses viene y se va
Tambien va pa culiacan
Trae linea directa ya
Y a su compadrito a visitar

Unos retro 13 pa pisar
Jordan son su gusto personal
Y pa pasear mazatlan
Tambien va pa michiocan
De clave el 50 asi nomas

Ahora tranquilo surtiendo de verde
Los mercaditos
Super al cinto
Para el peligro
Yo soy sencillo subiendo pa arriba
No veo pa lado
Yo me concentro
En mi trabajo
---------------------------------------------------
Siempre con la bolsita de mano lo han de ver.
Desde muy plebillo el humito blanco avente,
solo me bastan 15 segundos y subi
el kilometraje hasta 200 pa' correr.
Deportivo para la frontera recorrer,
la paloma es la que con una bella mujer.
Trae charola fuerte de la empresa,
la super en la piernera por si se llega a ofrecer.
Me tiran de marihuano...
y que le vamos a hacer.
Una 9 personalizada a de brillar,
siempre de buen modo como a mi me gusta andar.
En la vida yo le eh batallado cuando
cumpli 14 anos la mafia se hizo mi hogar.
Las colillas de los cigarrillos me fume,
hubo tiempos que no traia ni para comer.
Yo era aquel chamaco atrabancado que
todos veian pa' abajo y que nadie le tenia fe.
Ahora me piden un paro, a ver si cuentan con el.
Christian Louboutin,
X o Jordan me da igual, uno banadito ese nunca me a de faltar.
Aqui en la frontera fabricamos,
se acomoda bien el clavo y la cruzamos para alla.
Buena comunicacion con gente del cartel,
en poco tiempo las ganacias las triplique.
Si le miras los ojos tumbados no es que el morro ande enojado el
waxecito pega bien, de periodico era gallo, el primero que forje.
Imagenes fuertes en mi mente eh de llevar,
por 3 pinches libras me matan a mi carnal.
Perdi la inocencia muy temprano y esos
perros de las manos un dia los pude amarrar.
Asi empezo todo y ya son 7 anos aqui, sa
cando la cuenta falta mucho por vivir.
El camino es duro pa' llegarle y aqui
traigo unos chamanes que cuidan mi por venir.
Si quieren poner un 4...
ya me avisaron a mi.
---------------------------------------------------
Un avion comercial sale de Mazatlan, en Los Angeles va aterrizar
Viajo pa' Culiacan pa' la chamba buscar ya queria trabajar y ganar
La suela Louis Vuitton pa' delante le da, pa' tras no sabe dar
Le batalle bastante y pruebas de la vida
Pudo superar

En un mercedes negro a Las Vegas se va listo para enfiestarse y gozar
En un Cadillac blanco a alta velocidad con el chino lo vieron llegar
Buchanan's del 18 para Pancho Conos el Carlos llego
Y si ahi un problema un cargador extendido
Lo trae Genaro

Seno traigo su sangre, pero el es mi padre y tengo su apoyo ademas
Una nina es mi vida, mi reina es mi hija, es mi razon para luchar
No soy gente de nadie, no por mis tatuajes me van a juzgar
Me da igual un buen taco, con un bote al lado
Que un fino restaurant

Miami o Nueva York para tirar el rol, son gustos que se da el chavalon
Pancho ya se enfiesto la noche ya llego, sigo aqui del 18 pidio
Si un tiempo no se pudo, ahora sobran ganas pa' andar de cabron
Y una bella dama morenita o guera
No dice que no

Los Angeles mi casa del este mi raza recuerden no es bueno confiar
Sanguditas me cuida, saben que en la vida seguido se miran llegar
Pancho ya se despide tiene rato libre va pa' Culiacan
Caminen derecho y si andan en lo chueco
Hay que saber andar
---------------------------------------------------
We were watching TV getting wasted
Way down in the basement
Hanging out loose and shameless
They're up on the top of skyscrapers
Thinking that they're A-List
Talking loud pretending like they made it

And if you drink champagne on a private plane
Doesn't mean to say you're baller
Maybe you're just falling down
And I don't want your girls
I don't want your world at all
No, so

I'm a freak now (Freak now)
That's the way I'm living
Till they carry me out
I'm a freak now (Freak now)
Long as I'm still breathing
They'll be hearing me shout
Come on, so come on

Out there super yachting with their fake friends
Trying to keep it on-trend
Making fun of anyone who's different
We don't need that kind of entertainment
Vapid, hollow, vain shit
Rather show me love and not your bracelets

If you drink champagne on a private plane
Doesn't mean to say you're baller
Maybe you're just falling down
I don't want your girls
I don't want your world at all
No, so

I'm a freak now (Freak now)
That's the way I'm living
Till they carry me out
I'm a freak now (Freak now)
Long as I'm still breathing
They'll be hearing me shout
Come on, so come on
So come on, come on

They say the greatest things in life are free
And I believe, I believe, I believe it
And I don't wanna float in your debris

You know the greatest things in life are free
Let's believe, let's believe, let's believe it
So come and watch the sunset with me

I'm a freak now (Freak now)
That's the way I'm living
Till they carry me out
I'm a freak now (Freak now)
Long as I'm still breathing
They'll be hearing me shout
Come on, so come on
So come on, come on

Hey
Hey
Hey

Don't say it at my funeral
Say it to me now
Don't say it at my funeral
Say it to me now

Why won't you wake up
Why won't you wake up
Been through the trenches
Been through the mayhem
I see the lights down
I see my friends out
Don't see the purpose
In getting no love

We just get up then we'll
Dust off all of the weight
Hollerin' 'til we feel our
Voices start to break
I don't feel right
But it's better when you go away
While you're thinking of the words to say

Don't say it at my funeral
Say it to me now
Don't say it at my funeral
Say it to me now

I know I messed up
I know I messed up
Aimless intention
So quick to end us
My eyes are bloodshot
My heart is shell-shocked
What is the purpose of giving me no love

We just get up then we'll
Dust off all of the weight
Hollerin' 'til we feel our voices start to break
I don't feel right
But it's better when you go away
While you're thinkin' of the words to say

Don't say it at my funeral
Say it to me now
Don't say it at my funeral
Say it to me now

You know what I'm fuckin' tired of?
I'm tired of these motherfuckers that never say shit to your motherfucking face but say everything on the fuckin' side
You got something to say, say that shit to me in my motherfuckin' face
If not, you're fuckin' dead to me
You're fuckin' dead
Give me some fuckin' water

Don't say it at my funeral
Say it to me now
Don't say it at my funeral
Say it to me now
---------------------------------------------------
24hrs
Oh, oh, oh
I love the private club

This didn't happen overnight for me
I ain't have no one to fight for me
I had to learn it the hard way
When you never would call me
It would hurt to go back in time
To go back in time
It would hurt to go back in time
To go back in time

I don't wanna go back in time
But I remember every birthday
Told me you really miss your dad
And your mom don't understand sometimes
She should give you a chance sometimes
What's mines is yours and I'ma give you all of it
You try sometimes and don't know what to make of it
I'm real, for real, I'm never on that faking shit
Quit your job, you never have to take nobody's shit
You be my designer girl
I wish that I could buy the world
Just so I can hand you it

This didn't happen overnight for me
I ain't have no one to fight for me
I had to learn it the hard way
When you never would call me
It would hurt to go back in time
To go back in time
It would hurt to go back in time
To go back in time

I don't wanna go back in time
I don't wanna go back
'Cause the future too bright
VVS diamonds, you ain't gotta shine a light
For them to do a dance for you
And I spend them bands on you
Bleep! FaceTime
Remember when you used to ride for me?
You would throw it back for me
Bleep! FaceTime
Remember when you used to cry to me?
I would 'til you smile for me
I was broke and you ain't judge me, that's what got to me
Kept it real every time, that meant a lot to me
Just really know that I'm really trying
Ain't no limit every time we buying

This didn't happen overnight for me
I ain't have no one to fight for me
I had to learn it the hard way
When you never would call me
It would hurt to go back in time
To go back in time
It would hurt to go back in time
To go back in time
---------------------------------------------------
Same old pathways we are walking
Nothing's ever changed at all
World is only shifting color
Day by day, we rise and fall
Building up and breaking down
Time of peace and war
Cast away and gathering
Until we reach that shore

All you prophets, all you scholars
Waiting for the day to come
Science, progress, we can't stop
The run of things, we'll all be gone
The more we try to find, the less we see
We'll fly to Venus
We can accelerate the pace of change
But who will redeem us?

All we are
Is an ardent fire
And we rise and fall
Our life's desire
All we are
As long as we live
As long as we give
As long as we try to rise

Look up (Gain light)
Why not? (It's your life)
It's my faith (It's your time)
It's my faith (in you)
We will follow our ancestors
On the way to kingdom come

All we are
Is an ardent fire
And we rise and fall
Our life's desire
All we are
As long as we live
As long as we give
As long as we try to rise

All we are
Is an ardent fire
And we rise and fall
Our life's desire
All we are
As long as we live
As long as we give
As long as we try to rise

Toi et moi, deux cœurs qui se confondent
Au seuil de l'infini, loin du reste du monde
Haletants et soumis, a bord du lit
Qui tangue et va, sous toi et moi
Toi et moi, liberes des mensonges
Et sevres des tabous
Quand la nuit se prolonge entre rales et remous
Nos songes fous inventent un nous

Entre chien et loup dans nos reves deserts
L'amour a su combler les silences
Et nous, ses enfants nus, vierges de nos hier
Devenons toi et moi, laves de nos enfers
Porte-moi (porte-moi), au dela des angoisses
A l'appel du desir (appel du desir)
Du cœur de nos fantasmes, aux confins du plaisir
Que Dieu crea, pour toi et moi

J'etais sans espoir, tu as change mon sort
Offrant a ma vie une autre chance
Les mots ne sont que mots, les tiens vibraient si fort
Qu'en parlant a ma peau, ils eveillaient mon corps
Aime-moi, fais-moi l'amour encore
Encore et parle-moi
Pour que jusqu'aux aurores, aux sources de nos joies
Mes jours se noient, dans toi et moi
---------------------------------------------------
I used to be afraid of so much in this world
I'd tiptoe through each day like some frightened little girl
Then one day I realized I can't just run and hide from life
Now if someone pulls a gun on me, I pull out my knife


I don't follow...


Sit on my lap like I'm Santa and listen to me:
Face your fears
Stare them down
Don't be scared
Stand your ground
'Cause nothing is scary as it appears
All you gotta do is face your fears

If a bear runs at you in the woods, don't run away
Look it deep in the eyes, put your hand on its chest and say
"Bear, I'm not afraid!"
If you're in a burning building and smoke is everywhere
Keep calm, take a deep breath, and stay right there

Face your fears
Run with scissors
'Cause you can fly
Yes, you can fly
Fly out of a window
Fly off a building
Just believe in yourself
Face your fears

'Cause the children are the future
Face your fears
Follow your dreams
Stare at the sun
Play in the street
If you're scared of bees
Get stung!
Reach for the stars
Face your fears!
Face your fears
Join the marines
Swim right after eating
'Cause you are amazing
Wipe back to front
Drop out of school


Ah
Face your fears
Follow your dreams
Stare at the sun
A busy street
If you're scared of bees
Don't have an EpiPen ready
Literally touch the stars
Stars aren't that hot
Face your fears
Join the marines
Don't wait 30 minutes
So amazing
Don't wipe front to back
School is stupid


All you gotta do


Is face my fears?


Is face your


Fears, I got it


Fears, yeah!


Ah!
---------------------------------------------------
Spent a bag on my wrist, yeah
Spent a bag on my bitch, yeah
Spent another bag on a whip, yeah
Bank account still look lit
Lookin' like I just hit a lick, yeah
Still ride 'round with a stick
Fakeness make me sick, yeah
We get lit, get lit
We get lit, get lit, yeah
We get lit, make hits, yeah
I don't ever tweak or twitch, yeah
Bad bitches give me lip
I got a shooter that keeps my 6, yeah
Shooter got aim, don't miss, yeah
I'll never worry 'bout shit, yeah
All I care about is gettin' rich

'Cause I got a bag to claim
And I got M's to make
I'm layin' low, workin' hard
Why you so mad at me?
Why you so mad at me?
Why you so mad at me?
I'm laying' low, workin' hard
Why you so mad at me?
Why you so?

You can stay mad at me, I ain't even mindin' you
Think I might take your girl without even tryin' to
She tellin' you it's nothing 'cause she can't confide in you
I'm givin' her everything that she couldn't find in you
And maybe it's better that way, she knows its better my way
I ain't got time to just chill, everytime pussy get killed
Bringin' her pleasure, my pleasure
I go harder under pressure
Treat her like work and I stretch her
She only cum if I let her
Now she know what dealin' with the man feel like
Came around and showed her what she can feel like
And she love it when I let her count my racks
I told you, I ain't never going back

So I got a bag to claim
And I got M's to make
I'm layin' low, workin' hard
Why you so mad at me?
Why you so mad at me?
Why you so mad at me?
I'm layin' low, workin' hard
Why you so mad at me?
Why you so?

Why you so?
Why you so?
Why you so?
So mad

"Eh, eh negro, tu m'entends ou pas ?
T'es dans ta putain de Wati bulle ou quoi ?
C'est bien a toi que j'cause negro
J'entends qu'des rumeurs sur vous !
C'est quoi cette putain d'histoire Tiako ?
Y'avait sept putains de negros qui venaient de signer chez Wati B
Et maintenant il n'en reste que trois
C'est quoi ce merdier ?
J'pige que dalle a vos histoires, tu vas m'expliquer tout ca bordel"


On avait signe a sept mon lossa
Est-ce que tu t'en rappelles de ca ?
Est-ce que t'en as parle de ca ?
Dans lnos contrat y'a vos grosses initiales
J'vais pas tout raconter car cette histoire est sale
J'vais faire un debriefing en balle
On n'a pas fait les traitres, on n'a ni fait du mal
On passe pour les mechants et j'trouve pas ca normal
Chez Wati B on avait tous signe nous sept
Reflechissez pourquoi il ne reste que nous trois
Maintenant je me demande qui a retourne sa veste
En arriver la nous memes on n'en voulait pas
Le succes monte au crane
J'ai toujours ete droit
On est toujours les memes
On n'a pas signe de pacte
A se-lai y'a pas de blemes-pro
C'est capuche qu'on est la night gros
Bouge la te-te sur le tempo
C'est la trixma ou Tiako La Melo'
Casse ta puce si t'es sur ecoute
Je vais pas aller loin si je t'ecoute
On sait que c'est nous que tu redoutes
Bre-som meme au mois d'aout


"Ah j'comprend mieux negro
Toutes ces histoires c'est vraiment triste quand meme
J'ai du mal a comprendre comment un putain de ramassis de conneries vous en a fait arriver la
Et toi t'as un mot a dire Djeffi ?"


J'suis pose dans ma bulle comme un somnambule
Les faux freres, les putes, c'est ce qui vous encule
J'ai pas de vecu mais j'ai fait des thunes
T'as rien fait pour le tieks, t'as sauve ton cul
Devant ma gueule, tu veux jouer les durs
Quand t’etais dans le bat', t'avais des lacunes
J'suis toujours au banc, et j'peux pas l'quitter
Gros on etait sept, et chez Wati B
J'suis fatigue et j'suis degoute
T'as rien d’une secu', ca t'a marche d'ssus
J’etais la pour toi, mais pas ton jumeau
Couteau dans mon dos, la je fais mes abdos
T'es un rigolo, tu parles de la ligne mais t’etais banni
J'ai une grande famille, pas de trafiquants
La j'suis pas content
C'est une perte de temps, rafale dans tes dents


"Djeffi c'est pour ca que je t'ai toujours kiffe enfoire
J'commence a piger tout ce qui s'est trame dans votre putain de dos
Y'a trop de negros qui jactent sans savoir
Je pense que y'a encore un mec qui peut nous aider a mettre au clair toute cette putain d'histoire
Dis-leur Bne"


Le mal y est, j'ai rien quitte
Parle pas si tu parles pas monnaie
Qu'est-ce 'tu racontes ? J'suis au quartier moi
(Qu'est-ce 'tu racontes ? J'suis au quartier moi)
Si j'pouvais revenir au passe, j'serais revenu a l'epoque du carre
Si t'en parles dit la verite, boy
(Si t'en parles dit la verite, boy)
J'suis dans le binks et non j'ai pas perce, et non j'suis pas partie, c'est reel
Les grands m'ont averti, les grands me l'avaient predit, au phone-tel
"Tu cries, pourquoi tu cries ?
Attends j't'envoie les p'tits"
Comme un dwell, ils parlent de nous comme si, on les avait trahis


C'est pas la cite qui font les bonhommes
Mais c'est les bonhommes qui font la tess'
La rue c'est pas ta mere, la rue c'est pas ton pere
Elle t'a attire que des problemes
Que des faux freres, que des faux freres
Dans le brouillard ou j'suis du-per
J'en roule un autre, j'en roule un autre
Tous ca pour apaiser ma haine


"Ok les gars, c'est fini tous ca faut passer a autre chose maintenant
Ca sert a rien de repondre a toutes ces merdes
C'qu'on veut nous, c'est que vous nous envoyez de la putain de patate dans nos oreilles
Faites nous peter tous ca bordel de merde
Fini toutes ces histoires, maintenant faut laisser parler la musique
Alors rendez-vous le 16 mars bande d'enfoires d'negros"

Tonight, she the star of the show and she knows it
She knows it

No, she won't lie, she likes to get high
All night on all the attention
Yeah, I should know better, but I just might let her
Go on with her bad intentions
She's got best friends fightin' each other over her number
Like, "Brother, I saw her first"
She's got the whole room dancin' in the palm of her hand
Damn, she could break up a band
She could break up a band, baby

She's got every other girl dirty lookin' over their shoulders
Like the mountains on her Coors Light, her blue eyes couldn't be colder
No, I've never seen nothin' like her before
Tonight, she the star of the show and she knows it
She knows it

No, she won't lie, she likes to get high
All night on all the attention
Yeah, I should know better, but I just might let her
Go on with her bad intentions
She's got best friends fightin' each other over her number
Like, "Brother, I saw her first"
She's got the whole room dancin' in the palm of her hand
Damn, she could break up a band

No, she won't lie, she likes to get high
(Just 'cause she can, just 'cause she can)
No, she won't lie, she likes to get high
(Just 'cause she can, just 'cause she can)
No, she won't lie, she likes to get high

All night on all the attention (Oh)
Yeah, I should know better, but I just might let her
Go on with her bad intentions (Mm)
She's got best friends fightin' each other over her number
Like, "Brother, I saw her first" (Saw her first)
She's got the whole room dancin' in the palm of her hand
Damn, she could break up a band
