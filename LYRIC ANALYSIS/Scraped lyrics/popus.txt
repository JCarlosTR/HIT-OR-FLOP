I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around

And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?

And I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever now I drive alone past your street

And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do
Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you

And I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one
Oh, and I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever now I drive alone past your street

Red lights
Stop signs
I still see your face
In the white cars
Front yards
Can't drive past the places
We used to
Go to
'Cause I still fucking love you, babe

Sidewalks
We crossed
I still hear your voice
In the traffic
We're laughing
Over all the noise
God, I'm so blue
Know we're through
But I still fucking love you, babe

I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever now I drive alone past your street
Yeah, you said forever now I drive alone past your street

Why you always in a mood?
Fuckin 'round, actin' brand new
I ain't tryna tell you what to do
But try to play it cool
Baby, I ain't playing by your rules
Everything look better with a view
Why you always in a mood?
Fuckin 'round, actin' brand new
I ain't tryna tell you what to do
But try to play it cool
Baby, I ain't playing by your rules
Everything look better with a view


I could never get attached
When I start to feel, I unattach
Somehow I always end up feeling bad
Baby, I am not your dad, it's not all you want from me
I just want your company
Girl, it's obvious, elephant in the room
And we're a part of it, don't act so confused
And you love startin' it, now I'm in a mood
Now we're arguin' in my bedroom

We play games of love to avoid the depression
We've been here before
And I won't be your victim


Why you always in a mood?
Fuckin 'round, actin' brand new
I ain't tryna tell you what to do
But try to play it cool
Baby, I ain't playing by your rules
Everything look better with a view
Why you always in a mood?
Fuckin 'round, actin' brand new
I ain't tryna tell you what to do
But try to play it cool
Baby, I ain't playing by your rules
Everything look better with a view

So why you tryin' to fake your love on the regular
When you could be blowin' up just like my cellular
I won't ever let a shorty go and set me up
Only thing I need to know is if you wet enough
I'm talking slick back, kick back, gang sippin' forties
You keep playing, not another day with you shorty
Mismatched fits, that was way before you know me
Got a lot of love, well you better save it for me


We play games of love to avoid the depression
We've been here before
And I won't be your victim


Why you always in a mood?
Fuckin 'round, actin' brand new
I ain't tryna tell you what to do
But try to play it cool
Baby, I ain't playing by your rules
Everything look better with a view
Why you always in a mood?
Fuckin 'round, actin' brand new
I ain't tryna tell you what to do
But try to play it cool
Baby, I ain't playing by your rules
Everything look better with a view

Dando vuelta por El Condado contigo siempre arrebatao

Tu no eres mi Senora
Pero toma 5 mil, gastalo en Sephora
Louis Vuitton ya no compra en Pandora
Como piercing a los hombres perfora, eh
Hace tiempo le rompieron el cora (El Cora)
Estudiosa puesta pa' ser doctora (Doctora)
Pero le gustan los titere' wileando motora (Motora)
Yo estoy pa' ti las 24 hora'

You cut out a piece of me and now I bleed internally
Left here without you (No, no, no), without you (Ooh)
And it hurts for me to think about what life could possibly be like
Without you (No, no, no), without you (No, no)

I can't believe that you would up and leave me
Fuck all of your reasons
I lost my shit, you know I didn't mean it
Now I see it, you run and repeat it
And I can't take it back, so in the past is where we'll leave it, huh

So there you go, oh
Can't make a wife out of a ho, oh
I'll never find the words to say I'm sorry
But I'm scared to be alone

Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am

Stop, what the hell are you talking about? Ha
Get my pretty name out of your mouth
We are not the same with or without
Don't talk 'bout me like how you might know how I feel
Top of the world, but your world isn't real
Your world's an ideal

So go have fun
I really couldn't care less
And you can give 'em my best, but just know

I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am

I don't want press to put your name next to mine
We're on different lines, so I
Wanna be nice enough, they don't call my bluff
'Cause I hate to find
Articles, articles, articles
Rather you remain unremarkable (Got a lotta)
Interviews, interviews, interviews
When they say your name, I just act confused

Did you have fun?
I really couldn't care less
And you can give 'em my best, but just know

I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am

Yo se que esto no volvera a pasar
Pero si volviera a pasar
Se que seria tu debilidad
Porque la noche de anoche fue
Algo que yo no puedo explicar
Eso era dando y dandole sin parar
Tu me decias que morias por mi

Porque la noche de anoche fue
Algo que yo no puedo explicar
Eso era dando y dandole sin parar
Tu encima de mi
Yo encima de ti
Eh-eh, eh-eh

Tu me dejaste el cuerpo caliente infierno
Pero me dejaste el corazon frio invierno
Sonando que contigo es que duermo
Dime papi
Dime mami

Esa noche,  quien la borra?
Tu me besaste y se me cayo la gorra
Sin mucha labia, sin mucha cotorra
Cuando estoy contigo dejo que la vibra corra
Y que la luna nos supervise
Con esa boquita suena rico to' lo que tu me dices
Hicimos poses que yo jamas nunca hice
Tu te mojaste pa' que yo me bautice
Y me ponga serio, serio
Tu y yo juntos creando un imperio
Esos ojitos tienen un misterio
Pero al final nada de lo nuestro fue en serio

Y ya me ha pasao
Que me han ilusionao
Y ya me ha pasao
Que me han abandonao
Y ya me ha pasao
Que no estas a mi lao
Y ya me ha pasao

Porque la noche de anoche fue
Algo que yo no puedo explicar
Eso era dando y dandole sin parar
Tu encima de mi
Yo encima de ti

Porque la noche de anoche fue
Algo que yo no puedo explicar
Eso era dando y dandole sin parar
Yo encima de ti
Tu encima de mi

Que yo me iria otra vez pa' Japon
Papi, que penita esto, que maldicion
La paleta es dulce azucar de algodon
Y es la unica que me llega hasta el corazon

Ya no me olvida, la suerte esta echada
Se me enredaba el pelo en la pantalla
Sabe que solo lo hago de leyenda
Lo subo al cielo, yo soy su Messiah
El Benito es un diablillo y es un angel
Lo tengo jukiao como si fuera tate
Baby, entre nosotros nunca competimos
Si preguntan dice, "ella to' los records bate"

Y ya me ha pasao
Que me han ilusionao
Y ya me ha pasao
Que me han abandonao
Y ya me ha pasao
Que no estas a mi lao
Y ya me ha pasao

Porque la noche de anoche fue
Algo que yo no puedo explicar
Eso era dando y dandole sin parar
Tu encima de mi
Yo encima de ti

Porque la noche de anoche fue
Algo que yo no puedo explicar
Eso era dando y dandole sin parar
Tu encima de mi
Yo encima de ti

You broke me first, ah

Maybe you don't like talking too much about yourself
But you shoulda told me that you were thinking 'bout someone else
You're drunk at a party or maybe it's just that your car broke down
Your phone's been off for a couple of months, so you're calling me now

I know you, you're like this
When shit don't go your way you needed me to fix it
And like me, I did
But I ran out of every reason

Now suddenly you're asking for it back
Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts
When you broke me first
You broke me first

Took a while, was in denial when I first heard
That you moved on quicker than I could've ever, you know that hurt
Swear for a while I would stare at my phone just to see your name
But now that it's there, I don't really know what to say

I know you, you're like this
When shit don't go your way you needed me to fix it
And like me, I did
But I ran out of every reason

Now suddenly you're asking for it back
Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts
When you broke me first
You broke me first

What did you think would happen?
What did you think would happen?
I'll never let you have it
What did you think would happen?

Now suddenly you're asking for it back
Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts
When you broke me first
You broke me first
(You broke me first)
You broke me first, ah

(Na, na-na-na, na-na, eh
Na, na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Na, na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na)

Tienes una mirada que me encanta, baby
Y un cuerpecito que a mi mente envuelve
Estas hecha pa' mi, tu me resaltas
Tu me dejas enrolar entre tus nalgas
Mami, tu me encanta', baby
Un cuerpecito que a mi mente envuelve
Estas hecha pa' mi, tu me resaltas

No tiene amigas, tiene puras conocidas
Ella es calla'ita y no le gusta gastar saliva
Tiene una manera diferente de ver la vida
Lo que a ella no le conviene, le da paso y lo esquiva
Tiene su propio refran: "Cosas vienen, cosas van"
Todo pasa sin afan, ella me tiene de fan
Vivir feliz es su plan, entrega lo que le dan
Buena y mala, yin yang, anda sola y sin clan

Tu vibras diferente a las demas
Amo cuando te vienes, odio cuando te vas
Hacemos el amor y nos vamos de la faz
Y en un mundo de guerra, solo tu me das paz

Ay, es que tu tiene' una mirada que me encanta, baby
Y un cuerpecito que a mi mente envuelve
Estas hecha pa' mi, tu me resaltas
Tu me dejas enrolar entre tus nalgas
Mami, tu me encanta', baby
Y un cuerpecito que a mi mente envuelve
Estas hecha pa' mi, tu me resaltas

Mami, tu 'ta' como me gusta, me peleas y me busca'
Te vesti Cartier de arriba abajo pa' que luzcas
La posicion que tu tiene' no la tendra otra nunca
Que pesar mi ex
Si solamente somos tu y yo, tu y yo
Tu y yo, tu y yo
Tu y yo, tu y yo
Lo que podemos hacer, -er
De los temores de la vida no se vive
Y yo no tengo miedo de vivir algo contigo
Procuro darte lo que pidas siempre y cuando que quieras conmigo
Si no es amor, entonces que sea sexo
Soy el raton que come de tu queso
En tu casa estare como un preso
Condenado y sin proceso
Dicen que soy bandido y soy muy teso
Pero contigo se me olvida eso
Soy otro cuando me llena' de besos
Lo malo es que me encanta' con exceso

Tu vibras diferente a las demas
Amo cuando te vienes, odio cuando te vas
Hacemos el amor y nos vamos de la faz
Y en un mundo de guerra, solo tu me das paz

Ay, es que tu tiene' una mirada que me encanta, baby

Daytrip took it to ten (Hey)
---------------------------------------------------
There's some whores in this house

I said (hold up), certified freak
Seven days a week
wet-ass pussy
Make that pull-out game weak

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, you fucking with some wet-ass pussy
Bring a bucket and a mop for this wet-ass pussy
Give me everything you got for this wet-ass pussy

Beat it up, nigga, catch a charge
Extra large and extra hard
Put this pussy right in your face
Swipe your nose like a credit card
Hop on top, I wanna ride
I do a Kegel while it's inside
Spit in my mouth, look in my eyes
This pussy is wet, come take a dive
Tie me up like I'm surprised
Let's role play, I'll wear a disguise
I want you to park that big Mack Truck
Right in this little garage
Make it cream, make me scream
Out in public, make a scene
I don't cook, I don't clean
But let me tell you how I got this ring

Gobble me, swallow me
Drip down inside of me
Quick jump out 'fore you let it get inside of me
I tell him where to put it, never tell him where I'm 'bout to be
I run down on him 'fore I have a nigga running me
Talk your shit, bite your lip
Ask for a car while you ride that dick
You really ain't never gotta fuck him for a thang
He already made his mind up 'fore he came
Now get your boots and your coat
For this wet-ass pussy
He bought a phone just for pictures
Of this wet-ass pussy
Pay my tuition just to kiss me
On this wet-ass pussy
Now make it rain if you wanna
See some wet-ass pussy

Look, I need a hard hitter, I need a deep stroker
I need a Henny drinker, I need a weed smoker
Not a garden snake, I need a king cobra
With a hook in it, hope it lean over
He got some money, then that's where I'm headed
Pussy A1, just like his credit
He got a beard, well, I'm tryna wet it
I let him taste it, now he diabetic
I don't wanna spit, I wanna gulp
I wanna gag, I wanna choke
I want you to touch that little dangly thing
That swing in the back of my throat
My head game is fire, punani Dasani
It's going in dry and it's coming out soggy
I ride on that thing like the cops is behind me
I spit on his mic and now he tryna sign me, woo!

Your honor, I'm a freak bitch, handcuffs, leashes
Switch my wig, make him feel like he cheating
Put him on his knees, give him something to believe in
Never lost a fight, but I'm looking for a beating
In the food chain, I'm the one that eat you
If he ate my ass, he's a bottom feeder
Big D stand for "big demeanor"
I could make you bust before I ever meet you
If it don't hang, then he can't bang
You can't hurt my feelings, but I like pain
If he fuck me and ask, "Whose is it?"
When I ride the dick, I'ma spell my name

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, you fucking with some wet-ass pussy
Bring a bucket and a mop for this wet-ass pussy
Give me everything you got for this wet-ass pussy

Now from the top, make it drop
That's some wet-ass pussy
Now get a bucket and a mop
That's some wet-ass pussy
I'm talking WAP, WAP, WAP
That's some wet-ass pussy
Macaroni in a pot
That's some wet-ass pussy
---------------------------------------------------
Everybody knows my name now
But something 'bout it still feels strange
Like lookin' in a mirror, tryna steady yourself
And seeing somebody else

And everything is not the same now
It feels like all our lives have changed
Maybe when I'm older, it'll all calm down
But it's killing me now

What if you had it all
But nobody to call?
Maybe then you'd know me
'Cause I've had everything
But no one's listening
And that's just fucking lonely

I'm so lo-o-o-onely
Lo-o-o-onely

Everybody knows my past now
Like my house was always made of glass
And maybe that's the price you pay
For the money and fame at an early age
And everybody saw me sick
And it felt like no one gave a shit
They criticized the things I did
As an idiot kid

What if you had it all
But nobody to call?
Maybe then you'd know me

'Cause I've had everything
But no one's listening
And that's just fucking lonely

I'm so lo-o-o-onely
Lo-o-o-onely
I'm so lo-o-o-onely
Lo-o-o-onely
---------------------------------------------------
Dance with me under the diamonds
See me like breath in the cold
Sleep with me here in the silence
Come kiss me, silver and gold

You say that I won't lose you, but you can't predict the future
So just hold on like you will never let go
Yeah, if you ever move on without me
I need to make sure you know that

You are the only one I'll ever love (I gotta tell ya, gotta tell ya)
Yeah, you, if it's not you, it's not anyone (I gotta tell ya, gotta tell ya)
Lookin' back on my life, you're the only good I've ever done (Ever done)
Yeah, you, if it's not you, it's not anyone (Anyone), not anyone

Forever's not enough time to (Oh)
Love you the way that I want (Love you the way that I want)
'Cause every mornin', I'll find you (Oh)
I fear the day that I don't

You say that I won't lose you, but you can't predict the future
'Cause certain things are out of our control
Yeah, if you ever move on without me
I need to make sure you know that

You are the only one I'll ever love (Only one, I gotta tell ya, gotta tell ya)
Yeah, you, if it's not you, it's not anyone (I gotta tell ya, gotta tell ya)
Lookin' back on my life, you're the only good I've ever done (I've ever done)
Yeah, you, if it's not you, it's not anyone (It's not anyone, not anyone)

Oh-oh-oh-oh
If it's not you, it's not anyone
Oh-oh-oh, yeah, woah

Yeah, you are the only one I'll ever love (I gotta tell ya, gotta tell ya, yeah, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Yeah, you, if it's not you, it's not anyone (I gotta tell ya, gotta tell ya)
Lookin' back on my life, you're the only good I've ever done (Ever done, oh, yeah)
Yeah, you, if it's not you, it's not anyone
---------------------------------------------------
You put me on a pedestal and tell me I'm the best
Raise me up into the sky until I'm short of breath (Yeah)
Fill me up with confidence, I say what's in my chest
Spill my words and tear me down until there's nothing left
Rearrange the pieces just to fit me with the rest, yeah

But what if I, what if I trip?
What if I, what if I fall?
Then am I the monster?
Just let me know
And what if I, what if I sin?
And what if I, what if I break? Yeah
Then am I the monster? Yeah
Just let me know, yeah

I was fifteen when the world put me on a pedestal
I had big dreams of doin' shows and making memories
Made some bad moves tryna act cool, upset by their jealousy
Lifting me up (Lifting me up), lifting me up (Yeah)
And tearing me down (Down), tearing me down (Down, down)
I'll take responsibility for everything I've done (Yeah)
Holding it against me (Yeah) like you're the holy one (Yeah)

I had a chip on my shoulder, had to let it go
'Cause unforgiveness keeps them in control
I came in with good intentions then I let it go
And now I really wanna know

What if I, what if I trip? (Oh)
What if I, what if I fall? (I fall)
Then am I the monster? (Am I the monster?)
Just let me know (Let me know)
And what if I, what if I sin? (Oh)
And what if I, what if I break? (Yeah)
Then am I the monster? (Am I the monster?)
Just let me know (Oh, please just let me know, yeah)

La-da-da-duh-duh (Baby what if I fall?)
La-da-da-duh-duh-duh-na
La-da-da-da-duh-duh
La-da-da-duh-duh-duh-na
La-da-da-duh-duh (Please don't let me fall)
La-da-da-duh-duh-duh-na
La-da-da-da-duh-duh (Oh, please don't let me fall)
La-da-da-duh-duh-duh-na
---------------------------------------------------
Good day in my mind, safe to take a step out
Get some air now, let yo edge out
Too soon, I spoke
You be heavy in my mind, can you get the heck out?
I need rest now, got me bummed out
You so, you so, you
Baby, baby, babe
I've been on my empty mind shit

I try to keep from losin' the rest of me
I worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe
You don't care
Said, "Not tryna be a nuisance, this is urgent"
Tryna make sense of loose change
Got me a war in my mind
Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holdin' me
Choose to watch while the world break up in front of me

All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile
Still wanna try, still believe in
Good days, good days, always
Always inside (Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind)
Good day living in my mind

Tell me I'm not my fears, my limitations
I disappear if you let me
Feelin' like, yeah (On your own)
Feelin' like Jericho
Feelin' like Job when he lost his shit
Gotta hold my own, my cross to bear alone, I
Ooh, played and dipped, way to kill the mood
Know you like that shit
Can't groove it, ba-baby
Heavy on my empty mind shit

I gotta keep from losin' the rest of me (Rest of me)
Still worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe
You don't care
Said, "Not tryna be a nuisance, this is urgent" (It's urgent)
Tryna make sense of loose change
Got me a war in my mind (My mind)
Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holdin' me
Choose to watch while the world break up in front of me

All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile
Still wanna try, still believe in
Good days, good days, always (Good days on my mind, good days on my mind)
Sunny inside (Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind)
Good day living in my mind

Gotta get right
Tryna free my mind before the end of the world
I don't miss no ex, I don't miss no text
I choose not to respond
I don't regret, just pretend shit never happened
Half of us layin' waste to our youth, it's in the present
(Na-na, na-na, na-na, na)
Half of us chasin' fountains of youth and it's in the present now

Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind
You've been making me feel like I'm
Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind

I still remember
Third of December
Me in your sweater
You said it looked better

On me, than it did you
Only if you knew
How much I liked you
But I watch your eyes, as she

Walks by
What a sight for
Sore eyes
Brighter than a
Blue sky
She's got you
Mesmerized
While I die

Why would you ever kiss me?
I'm not even half as pretty
You gave her your sweater
It's just polyester, but you like her better
Wish I were Heather

Watch as she stands with
Her holding your hand
Put your arm 'round her shoulder
Now I'm getting colder

But how could I hate her?
She's such an angel
But then again, kinda
Wish she were dead, as she

Walks by
What a sight for
Sore eyes
Brighter than a
Blue sky
She's got you
Mesmerized
While I die

Why would you ever kiss me?
I'm not even half as pretty
You gave her your sweater
It's just polyester, but you like her better
I wish I were Heather

Wish I were Heather
Wish I were Heather

Why would you ever kiss me?
I'm not even half as pretty
You gave her your sweater
It's just polyester
But you like her better
Wish I were

This ain't no guitar, bitch, this a Glock (Woo)
My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me (Woo)
You better let me go the day you need me (Woo)
Soon as you up me on that nigga, get to bustin' (Woo)
And if I ain't enough, go get the chop

It's safe to say I earned it, ain't a nigga gave me nothin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm ready to hop out on a nigga, get to bustin'
Know you heard me say, "You play, you lay," don't make me push the button
Full of pain, dropped enough tears to fill up a fuckin' bucket
Goin' for buckets, I bought a chopper
I got a big drum, it hold a hundred, ain't goin' for nothin'
I'm ready to air it out on all these niggas, I can see 'em runnin'
Just talked to my mama, she hit me on FaceTime just to check up on me and my brother
I'm really the baby, she know that her youngest son was always guaranteed to get the money (Okay, let's go)
She know that her baby boy was always guaranteed to get the loot
She know what I do, she know 'fore I run from a nigga, I'ma pull it out and shoot (Boom)
PTSD, I'm always waking up in cold sweats like I got the flu
My daughter a G, she saw me kill a nigga in front of her before the age of two

I got the mop, watch me wash 'em like detergent
And I'm ballin', that's why it's diamonds on my jersey
Slide on opps' side and flip the block back, yeah, yeah
My junior popped him and left him lopsided, yeah, yeah
We spin his block, got the rebound, Dennis Rodman
Fool me one time, you can't cross me again
Twelve hundred horsepower, I get lost in the wind
If he talkin' on the yard, the pen' dogs'll take his chin
Maybach SUV for my refugees
Buy blocks in the hood, put money in the streets
I was solo when the opps caught me at the gas station
Had it on me, thirty thousand, thought it was my last day
But they ain't even want no smoke
If I had to choose it, murder what she wrote


Let's go
Brand new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car

'Cause, ah-ah, I'm in the stars tonight
So watch me bring the fire and set the night alight

Shoes on, get up in the morn
Cup of milk, let's rock and roll
King Kong, kick the drum, rolling on like a rolling stone
Sing song when I'm walking home
Jump up to the top, LeBron
Ding dong, call me on my phone
Ice tea and a game of ping pong

Can you hear the bass boom? I'm ready
Life is sweet as honey
Yeah, this beat cha ching like money
Disco overload, I'm into that, I'm good to go
I'm diamond, you know I glow up
Hey, so let's go

'Cause, ah-ah, I'm in the stars tonight
So watch me bring the fire and set the night alight
Shining through the city with a little funk and soul
So I'ma light it up like dynamite, whoa

Bring a friend, join the crowd
Whoever wanna come along
Word up, talk the talk, just move like we off the wall
Day or night the sky's alight
So we dance to the break of dawn
Ladies and gentlemen, I got the medicine, so you should keep ya eyes on the ball, huh

This is getting heavy
Can you hear the bass boom? I'm ready
Life is sweet as honey
Yeah, this beat cha ching like money
Disco overload, I'm into that, I'm good to go
I'm diamond, you know I glow up
Let's go

'Cause, ah-ah, I'm in the stars tonight
So watch me bring the fire and set the night alight
Shining through the city with a little funk and soul
So I'ma light it up like dynamite, whoa

Dy-na-na-na, na-na, na-na-na, na-na, life is dynamite
Dy-na-na-na, na-na, na-na-na, na-na, life is dynamite

Oh my God, oh my God
This feeling's just begun
I'm saying things I've never said
Doing things I've never done

Oh my God, oh my God
When I see you I should run
But I'm frozen in motion
And my head tells me to stop
Tells me to stop

Feeling feelings I feel about us
Try to fight it but it's never enough

My heart is certain
It's more than a crush
'Cause I'm frozen in motion
And my head tells me to stop

But my heart goes

Oh my God, oh my God
Can't believe what I've become
I'm thinking things I shouldn't think
Singing songs I've never sung

Oh my God, oh my God
When I see you I should run
But I'm frozen in motion
And my head tells me to stop
Tells me to stop

Feeling feelings I feel about us
Try to fight it but it's never enough
('Cause my heart)
My heart is certain
It's more than a crush
'Cause I'm frozen in motion
And my head tells me to stop

But my heart goes

Mujere' como tu uno las desea y las anora (Anora)

A ella le gusta lo malo, lo bueno, lo caro
Titerona, no se asusta si escucha un disparo
El cuerpo e' hermoso, los ojos son claro'
Era mi reina, ahora e' mi diosa, a ella ni la comparo


Que pereza
Verla triste con tanta belleza
Quien dano un corazon con mucha pureza
No sabe tratar con delicadeza (-deza)

Princesa, a el no le interesa
Si yo soy el que te toca y te besa
Cuando la vi yo dije: "Quiero con esa"
Desde esa vez no sales de mi cabeza

Baby, ya yo me entere
Se nota cuando me ve
Ahi donde no has llegao
Sabes que yo te llevare
Y dime que quieres beber
Es que tu eres mi bebe
Y de nosotros quien va a hablar si no nos dejamos ver

Y a veces es Dolce, a veces es Bulgari
Cuando te lo quito despues de lo' party
Las copas de vino, las libras de mari
Tu 'tas bien suelta y yo de safari
Tu mueves el culo fenomenal
Pa' yo devorarte como animal
Si no te has venido, yo te vo' a esperar
En mi cama y lo vo' a celebrar

Baby, a ti no me opongo
Y siempre te lo pongo
Y si tu me tira vamo' a nadar en lo hondo

Si es por mi te lo pongo
De septiembre hasta agosto
A mi sin cojones los que digan tus amigas

Ya yo me entere
Se nota cuando me ve
Ahi donde no has llegao'
Sabes que yo te llevare
Dime que quieres beber
Es que tu eres mi bebe
Y de nosotros quien va a hablar si no nos dejamos ver

( Me sigue?)
Mami, me tiene' jukiao
Si, si fuera la Urus me tuviese' parkiao
Dando vuelta por El Condado contigo siempre arrebatao

Tu no eres mi Senora
Pero toma 5 mil, gastalo en Sephora
Louis Vuitton ya no compra en Pandora
Como piercing a los hombres perfora, eh
Hace tiempo le rompieron el cora (El Cora)
Estudiosa puesta pa' ser doctora (Doctora)
Pero le gustan los titere' wileando motora (Motora)
Yo estoy pa' ti las 24 hora'

Baby, a ti no me opongo
Y siempre te lo pongo (Yo te lo pongo)

Pasa el tiempo (Pasa el tiempo)
Y no te veo (Y no te veo)
Dime donde estas
Dime donde estas
Que extrano el bellaqueo (Bellaqueo)
Las noches de perreo (Noches de perreo)
Dime donde estas (Dime donde estas)
Dime donde estas

Que ando mirando la foto de cuando chingamos
Bonitos recuerdos de cuando nos escapamos
Nos comimos en el carro, al cuarto ni llegamos
Eh, desde que te desnudaste
A mi mente te mudaste

Estoy puesto pa' repetir
Lo de tu y yo en el balcon
Del hotel con un blunt
No te encuentro en ninguna aplicacion
Dime si fue que volviste con aquel cabron
Porque a mi no me molesta, ser tu chillo
Tu no eres monja, ni yo monaguillo
Me tiene loco ese culo bien pillo
Si se abre un OnlyFans, la baby se hace millo

Y ella es loca
Con que le haga cosas con mi boca
Hace tiempo no la veo y ya toca

Ey, me tienes mirando la foto de cuando chingamos
Bonitos recuerdos de cuando nos escapamos
Nos comimos en el carro, al cuarto ni llegamos
Eh, desde que te desnudaste
A mi mente te mudaste
---------------------------------------------------
(One, two)

Stop the clocks, it's amazing
You should see the way the light dances off your hair
A million colours of hazel, golden and red
Saturday morning is fading
The sun's reflected by the coffee in your hand
My eyes are caught in your gaze all over again

We were love drunk, waiting on a miracle
Trying to find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like the world had disappeared
Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go
I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow
And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears

Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow

The weather outside's changing
The leaves are buried under six inches of white
The radio is playing, Iron & Wine
This is a new dimension
This is a level where we're losing track of time
I'm holding nothing against it, except you and I

We were love drunk, waiting on a miracle
Trying to find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like the world had disappeared
Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go
I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow
And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears

Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
---------------------------------------------------
I hear a lot about sinners
Don't think that I'll be a saint
But I might go down to the river
'Cause the way that the sky opens up when we touch
Yeah, it's makin' me say

That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy

I don't do well with the drama
And, no, I can't stand it being fake
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
I don't believe in nirvana
But the way that we love in the night gave me life
Baby, I can't explain

That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy


They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, "Don't go crushin'"
Wise men say fools rush in
But I don't know (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, "Don't go crushin'"
Wise men say fools rush in
But I don't know {Chance the Rapper}


The first step pleases the Father
Might be the hardest to take
But when you come out of the water
I'm a believer, my heart is fleshy
Life is short with a temper like Joe Pesci
They always come and sing your praises, your name is catchy
But they don't see you how I see you, Parlay and Desi
Cross, Tween, Tween, Hesi' hit the jet speed
When they get messy, go lefty like Lionel Messi
Let's take a trip and get the Vespas or rent a Jet Ski
I know the spots that got the best weed, we goin' next week
I wanna honor, wanna honor you, bride's groom, I'm my father's child
I know when the son takes the first steps, the Father's proud (Yes)
If you make it to the water, He'll part the clouds (Uh)
I know He made you a snack like Oscar Proud (Mwah)
Suffer it to be so now gotta clean it up (Ooh)
Formalize the union in communion, He can trust (Woo)
I know I ain't leavin' you like I know He ain't leavin' us (Ah)
I know we believe in God, and I know God believes in us


'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second, on God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second, on God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so ho-ho-ho-holy

Ahora todo cambio, le toca a ella
Latino gang
Ayer la vi perreando solita (Welcome to the remix)
Se ve ma' bonita
Ahora que no esta con ese man
Que la felicidad como ropa se la quita

Que yo siempre estaba cuando tu no estaba'
Fue tanto dolor que ya no me mataba
Poco a poco ya no te necesitaba
Y yo sonreia mientra' lo enrolaba
Y tu (Uh-uh-uh)
Diciendo que fue falta de actitud
Pero en esta relacion hice mas que tu, yeh (Yeh-eh)
Y en un estado te manda a decir que ( Da-ddy Yan-kee!)

Ahora todo cambio, le toca a ella (Prr)
Mari y una botella ( Que, que?)
Gracia' al maltrato se puso bella (What?)
Ahora tu la quiere' y no te quiere ella

Ahora tu la quiere' y no te quiere ella (One, yeah, huh)

Vacilando y que se la ensenen a el (Dile)
Ya no le gusta seguir patrone', ella e' la patrona (Ey)
Se te fue la princecita, buscate a Fiona, porque
To' los fine' de semana esta de party en party (Wuh)
Sigue matando las gana' con botella y mari
Te dejaron un estado ahi, ahi, ahi
Dice me sigue tirando y no cai ahi, ahi ( Que, que?)
Incumpliste el contrato, yo puse lo que faltaba
A ella le gusta el maltrato, pero no el que tu le daba' (Ah)
Le dicen la Apple, tiene su iPhone, su iPad (Eh, eh)
Hay pa' perrear, hay pa' beber, hay pa' fumar, hay pa' joder,  que? (Ah, ah)
To' los fine' de semana esta de party en party

Dedica'o pa' ti, decia asi: (Welcome to the remix)

 Tu te ha' creido que te iba a llorar? (Uhm)
Tu la lleva' clara que te iba a espera' (No)
Tu te pensaste que tu me tenia'
Pero nunca me tuviste, soy La ROSALIA (Mira)
Si llevo tanta' cadena' no e' pa' que na' de mamar (Nah)

Y ahora todo cambio, le toca a ella (A ella)
Party y una botella (Oh)
Gracia' al maltrato se puso bella (Yah)
Ahora tu la quiere' y no te quiere ella (Nah, nah, huh)

Todo empezo con el bloqueo de WhatsApp
Por mas que tu la llames tampoco va a contestar
Ahora yo ando solo de rumba y tu te derumbas
Lloras tu porque sus lagrimas no valoraste
Hasta tu madre dice que no la cuidaste
Si el corazon te odia por lo mal que la trataste
Y si te ve en la calle seguro te saca el de'o
La cogiste de pendeja, ahora tu eres un pendejo (Wuh)
Tu caiste muy bajo, en la fiesta borracho
Te merece' esto y a todo' lo caption (Toma)
Y ya sabemo' que tu anda' malherido (Laramercy gang)
En la vida to' se paga porque fuiste un malparido (Fa-rru)

Todo cambio, dio un giro 360 
Se puso ma' rica y esta puesta pa' la vuelta
No quiere saber de ti, quemando por la venta
El carajo, brother, karma te paso la cuenta (Pum-pum-pum)
Y ahora anda rollie rompiendo la calle (Eah)
Se canso, ya no quiere coro con nadie
Le cogio el gusto y ya no hay quien la pare
Y ahora esta dificil de nuevo que la jale (Farru)

Ahora ella quiere carretera
Y ahora e' mas cara, esta soltera
Bebe y fuma la noche entera
Y le da tremenda loquera
Cuando coge la borrachera
Le da con oir "Safaera"
Y le entra la bellaquera
Pero no se la da a cualquiera
Pri-yah-yah-yah-yah,  Farru!

Ahora todo cambio, le toca a ella (Prr)
Mari y una botella ( Que, que?)
Gracia' al maltrato se puso bella (What?)
Ahora tu la quiere' y no te quiere ella (Wuh, wuh)
Ahora todo cambio, le toca a ella ( Que?)
Hookah y una botella (D-D-D-D.Y)
Gracia' al maltrato se puso bella
Ahora tu la quiere' y no te quiere ella

Yeah, huh

If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like

We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never
Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far
Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
Shining just the way we are
I feel like we're forever every time we get together
But whatever, let's get lost on Mars

Yo puedo ofrecerte una vida muy interesante
Pero depende para ti que es interesante
Si estas pensando en discotecas, carros y diamantes
Entonces puede que pa' ti sea insignificante

No es vida de rico
Pero se pasa bien rico
Y si en la casa no alcanza pa'l aire
Te pongo abanico

Yo no tengo pa' darte ni un peso
Pero si puedo darte mis besos
Pa' sacarte yo tengo poquito
Pero es gratis bailar pegaito
Yo no tengo pa' abrirte champana
Pero si cervecita en la playa
Aunque es poco lo que yo te ofrezco
Con orgullo
Todo lo que tengo es tuyo

Seria mentira decir que ahora mismo
Puedo darte el viaje que tu te mereces
No sera Europa pero el sol cayendo
Desde mi balcon medio se le parece

Y yo que tu no me acostumbraria
A estar aqui en estas cuatro paredes
Haria todo para comprarte un dia
Casa con piscina si Diosito quiere

Yo no tengo pa' darte ni un peso
Pero si puedo darte mis besos
Pa' sacarte yo tengo poquito
Pero es gratis bailar pegaito

Yo no tengo pa' abrirte champana
Pero si cervecita en la playa
Aunque es poco lo que yo te ofrezco
Con orgullo
Todo lo que tengo es tuyo

Aunque no es mucho
Es tuyo, tuyo, tuyo

No es vida de rico
Pero se pasa bien rico (Se pasa bien rico)
Y si en la casa no alcanza pa'l aire
Te pongo abanico

Yo no tengo pa' darte ni un peso
Pero si puedo darte mis besos
Pa' sacarte yo tengo poquito
Pero es gratis bailar pegaito (Ay, pegaito)

Yo no tengo pa' abrirte champana
Pero si cervecita en la playa (Ay, en la playa)
Aunque es poco lo que yo te ofrezco
Con orgullo
Todo loque tengo es tuyo

In the fading light, hearts collide
Shadows dance in the distance
Something just ain't right, I'm cold inside
Help me find what I'm missing

We're all scared to fly, still, we try
Learn to be brave, see the other side
Won't you lead me there? Have no fear
Close your eyes, find paradise

Oh, my, my, my
There's a thousand miles between you and I
Oh, my, my, my
Just a thousand miles between me and paradise

Oh, my, my, my
There's a thousand miles between you and I
Oh, my, my, my
Just a thousand miles between me and paradise

Oh (Paradise), oh, my, my, my
Oh (Paradise), oh, my, my, my
Oh (Paradise), oh, my, my, my
Just a thousand miles between me and paradise

When the dark has gone, the morning's won
We're gonna feel something different
It will set you free if you just tell me
Every secret, I'll listen

We're all scared to fly, still, we try
Learn to be brave, see the other side
Won't you lead me there? Have no fear
Close your eyes, find paradise

Paradise, paradise
Close your eyes, find paradise
Paradise, paradise
Close your eyes, find para

Oh, my, my, my
There's a thousand miles between you and I
Oh, my, my, my
Just a thousand miles between me and paradise

Oh, oh, my, my, my
Oh, oh, my, my, my
Oh, oh, my, my, my
Just a thousand miles between me and paradise

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree

I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you, yeah

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
And I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree

I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day

I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
And I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe

I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click

'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do?
Baby, all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

Oh, all the lights are shining so brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's laughter fills the air

And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need?
Won't you please bring my baby to me?

Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just wanna see my baby
Standing right outside my door

Oh, I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Baby, all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

All I want for Christmas is you, baby

A ella ya no le motiva salir
Quedo traumada
Todavia piensa en ese infeliz
Sus amigas la sonsacan a llevarsela pa' la calle
A que se despeje y olvide

De una relacion toxica acaba 'e salir
La convencieron y se arreglo pa' ir

(Lara MercyGang)
(Farru)

Y se va pa' la calle en busca de un jangueo
Donde pongan musica, haya hookah y botelleo
Y se va pa' la calle en busca de un jangueo
Ella no quiere amores, ella esta puesta pa'l perreo

Ella llego depresiva pero le pusieron "Tusa"
Ahi se solto y se desabotono la blusa
Se le pego a la hookah y de la botella abusa
Dice que hoy se bebe y pone a ese cabron de excusa

Le da hasta abajo al ritmo del bajo
Lo que hablen de ella le importa un carajo
No quiere saber de compromiso
Y que se muera el cabron que dano le hizo

Le da hasta abajo al ritmo del bajo
Lo que hablen de ella le importa un carajo
Esta puesta pa' romper la carretera
Y ahora mas, que esta de moda estar soltera

Y se va pa' la calle en busca de un jangueo
Donde pongan musica, haya hookah y botelleo
Y se va pa' la calle en busca de un jangueo
Ella no quiere amores, ella esta puesta pa'l perreo

( Donde estan las mujeres que no tienen marido?)
Estamos en vivo (Farru)
Ya, ya, ya, ya

Si es lo que quieres, toma
Bailame de frente y dime (Tra, tra)
Con la mano arriba grita (Tra, tra)
Asi es que mi corillo grita (Farru)

Ahora tu, mami, dile (Farru)
Tu eres la que manda, dile (Tra, tra)
Yo hice esto pa' ti, grita
 Donde estan las mujeres solteras?

Le da hasta abajo al ritmo del bajo
Lo que hablen de ella le importa un carajo
No quiere saber de compromiso
Y que se muera el cabron que dano le hizo

Le da hasta abajo al ritmo del bajo
Lo que hablen de ella le importa un carajo
Esta puesta pa' romper la carretera
Y ahora mas, que esta de moda estar soltera

Y se va pa' la calle en busca de un jangueo
Donde pongan musica, haya hookah y botelleo
Y se va pa' la calle en busca de un jangueo
Ella no quiere amores, ella esta puesta pa'l perreo
---------------------------------------------------
Debo confesar
Ahora estoy buscando algo mas
Una razon para volverme a enamorar
Puede que seas tu

Quiero una chica, quiero una yal
El amor de mi vida
Una que pueda amar

Quiero una chica, quiero una yal
Quiero una mujer que sea muy especial
Quiero una dama que me sepa amar
Y por supuesto que se sepa menear, oye

Quiero una chica, quiero una yal
Quiero una mujer que sea muy especial
Quiero una dama que me sepa amar

Que no diga que no, que no, que no, que no, que no, que
Que la toque y se aloque loque, loque, loque, loque, loque
Que baile y le rebote, bote, bote, bote, bote
Por eso la quiero
Pa' que ella me quiera

Que no diga que no, que no, que no, que no, que no, que
Que la toque y se aloque loque, loque, loque, loque, loque
Que baile y le rebote, bote, bote, bote, bote
Por eso la quiero
Pa' que ella me quiera

Me monte en un barco
He cruzado el mar, he subido el rio
Por usted me he buscado mis lios
Quiero me que abrace en Bogota, en la noche hay frio
Y que me sobes el pelo mami, mientras me quedo dormido
Necesito alguien pa' conversar
Necesito alguien pa' reir y alguien pa' llorar
Alguien que coma mucho
Alguien que salga a rumbear
Pa' quitarle los tacos cuando lleguemos de bailar

Quiero una chica, quiero una yal
Quiero una mujer que sea muy especial
Quiero una dama que me sepa amar
Y por supuesto que se sepa menear, oye

Quiero una chica, quiero una yal
Quiero una mujer que sea muy especial
Quiero una dama que me sepa amar

Si yo fuera tu le
Bajo un poco esa actitud que me tiene distante
Piensalo un instante
Puede ser que yo te encante

Si yo fuera tu le
Bajo un poco esa actitud que me tiene de ti distante
Piensalo un instante
Puede ser que yo te encante, bebe

Quiero una chica, quiero una yal
Quiero una mujer que sea muy especial
Quiero una dama que me sepa amar
Y por supuesto que se sepa menear, oye

Quiero una chica, quiero una yal
Quiero una mujer que sea muy especial
Quiero una dama que me sepa amar
Y por supuesto que se sepa menear, oye

I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy

I need somebody to heal
Somebody to know
Somebody to have
Somebody to hold
It's easy to say
But it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

Now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you

Now, I need somebody to know
Somebody to heal
Somebody to have
Just to know how it feels
It's easy to say
But it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape

Now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound til I come back around

For now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

But now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
---------------------------------------------------
All I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach but I stand
In California with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater
Let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high waisted shorts, oh

She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no

'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides a mind
To move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue
'Cause you love the taste, yeah
These hearts adore
Everyone the other beats hardest for
Inside this place is warm
Outside it starts to pour

Comin' down
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about
No, no, no

'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater, woah

Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah

'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
'Cause it's too cold for you here
Now, let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

And it's too cold, it's too cold
The holes of my sweater
---------------------------------------------------
Three little birds sat on my window
And they told me I don't need to worry
Summer came like cinnamon, so sweet
Little girls double-dutch on the concrete

Maybe sometimes we got it wrong, but it's all right
The more things seem to change, the more they stay the same
Don't you hesitate

Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down

You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow

Blue as the sky, sunburnt and lonely
Sipping tea in the bar by the roadside (Just relax, just relax)
Don't you let those other boys fool you
Gotta love that afro hairdo

Maybe sometimes we feel afraid, but it's all right
The more you stay the same, the more that they seem to change
Don't ya think it's strange?

Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down

You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow

Just more than I could take, pity for pity's sake
Some nights kept me awake, I thought that I was stronger
When you gonna realize that you don't even have to try any longer?
Do what you want to

Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song
Just go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down
You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow
---------------------------------------------------
I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open/shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneaking in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a 90's trend

Wait for the signal and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open/shut case
I guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Hey, that's my man
That's my man
Yeah, that's my man
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
That's my man
Hey, that's my man
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

We couldn't turn around till we were upside down
I'll be the bad guy now, but know I ain't too proud
I couldn't be there even when I try
You don't believe it, we do this every time

Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

Let go, I got a feeling that it's time to let go
I said so, I knew that this was doomed from the get-go
You thought that it was special, special
But it was just the sex though, the sex though
And I still hear the echoes (The echoes)
I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go

Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

Maybe you don't understand what I'm going through
It's only me, what you got to lose?
Make up your mind, tell me, what are you gonna do?
It's only me, let it go

Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

Don't stay awake for too long
Don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed

Yeah...
I don't wanna fall asleep, I don't wanna pass away
I been thinking of our future cause I'll never see those days
I don't know why this has happened, but I probably deserve it
I tried to do my best, but you know that I'm not perfect
I been praying for forgiveness, you been praying for my health
When I leave this earth, hoping you'll find someone else
Cause yeah, we still young there's so much we haven't done
Getting married, start a family, watch your husband with his son
I wish it could be me, but I won't make it off this bed
I hope I go to heaven, so I see you once again
My life was kinda short, but I got so many blessings
Happy you were mine, it sucks that it's all ending

Don't stay awake for too long
Don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed

And I, don't stay awake for too long
Don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed

I'm happy that you're here with me, I'm sorry if I tear up
When me and you were younger you would always make me cheer up
Taking goofy videos while walking through the park
You would jump into my arms every time you heard a bark
Cuddle in your sheets, sang me sound asleep
And sneak out through your kitchen at exactly 1:03
Sundays went to church, on Mondays watched a movie
Soon you'll be alone, sorry that you have to lose me

Don't stay awake for too long
Don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed

And I, don't stay awake for too long
Don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed

Don't stay awake for too long
Don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed

And I, don't stay awake for too long
Don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed

And I, don't stay awake for too long
Don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed

You know sometimes I think about us now and then
But I never want to fall again

Yo no te quisiera olvidar
Pero contigo es todo o na'

You are deep in water
Now you are drowning us
You question my love
Like it's not enough
But I hate that you know, you know, you know
You got me tied up

You regret it now
But it's your mistake
What makes you think
That my mind will change
And you hate that you know, you know, you know, you know
You messed up

One day you'll love me again
One day you'll love me for sure
One day you'll wake up feeling how I've been feeling, baby
Knock on my door

One day you'll love me again
Hug me again till the end
One day you'll beg me to try

One day you'll realize I'm more than your lover
I'm more than your lover, I'm your friend

Acercate un poquito no mas
Que yo quiero que te quedes conmigo
Deja tus amigas alla atras
Que nos vamos en un viaje escondidos
Nos vamos pa' Turk & Caicos
Y ahi calmamos las ganas
Sueltate conmigo, mama
Que ya no hay marcha atras

Una noche sin ti, no es tan facil, baby
Que yo soy pa' ti, y tu eres pa' mi
Nunca me dejes de querer
Oh, na, na, na
Contigo por siempre, baby
No quiero dejarte esta vez

One day you'll love me again
One day you'll love me for sure
One day you'll wake up feeling how I've been feeling, baby
Knock on my door

One day you'll love me again
Hug me again till the end
One day you'll beg me to try

One day you'll realize I'm more than your lover
I'm more than your lover, I'm your friend

Ya se que estoy en tu corazon
Quizas en el fondo
Otras babies me escriben, nunca les respondo
La vida da vueltas y el mundo es redondo
Y yo voy a que te beso de nuevo en London
O si no en Marbella
Encima de la arena viendo las estrellas
Yo se que ni olas han borrado mi huella
Pero tu pichaera es lo que me atropella

Sol, playa y en la arena vamo' alla
Baby, no te quedes calla'
Yo se que tu quieres guayar conmigo
Otra vez me tienes en depresion
Fumando en la habitacion
Pero yo se que

One day you'll love me again
One day you'll love me for sure
One day you'll wake up feeling how I've been feeling, baby
Knock on my door

One day you'll love me again
Hug me again till the end
One day you'll beg me to try

One day you'll realize I'm more than your lover
I'm more than your lover, I'm your friend

One day you'll love me again
One day you'll realize am more than your lover
I'm more than your lover, I'm your friend

Whoa, whoa
Yeah

Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they're doin' all this and all that?

Tired of beefin' you bums, you can't even pay me enough to react
Been wakin' up in the crib and sometimes I don't even know where I'm at
Please don't play that nigga songs in this party, I can't even listen to that
Anytime that I ran into somebody, it must be a victory lap, ay
Shorty, come sit on my lap, ay, they're sayin' Drizzy just snap
Distance between us is not like a store, this isn't a closeable gap, ay
I've seen some niggas attack and don't end up makin' it back

I know that they're at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they're doin' all this and all that?

I'm in the trenches, relax
Can you not play that little boy in the club? 'Cause we do not listen to rats
We in Atlanta, I buy her a wig, she tellin' me Tae is the best
Point at the nigga who act like a killer, but you only one from the 'net
I'm like DaBaby, I'm not just a rapper, you play with me, you gon' get stretched
Ooh-oh
Bring Drake to the hood, surround Drake around Dracs
Even though I got a case, I'ma do what it take
And I never been embraced
And the money's hard to make
So I bet they're on their face right now

I know that they're at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they're doin' all this and all that?

When he tell the story, that's not how it went
Know they be lyin', a hundred percent
Moved out the Ritz and forgot 'bout the Bent'
Valet just called me to tell me come get it
Knocked that boy off and I don't want no credit
If it was me, they wouldn't regret it
Left me for dead and now they wan' dead it, yeah
Heart is still beatin', my niggas still eatin'
Backyard, it look like the Garden of Eden
Pillow talk with 'em, she spillin' the tea
And then shorty came back and said she didn't mean it
It's hard to believe it

I know that they're at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they're doin' all this and all that?

Si hay rumba no quiero mas na
Yo lo que vine fue a pasarla bien
Cual es el plan
Que yo me activo
Dimelo que lo que
Que tu quieres conmigo
Que suene el Dembow
Viene agresivo
Pero te advierto que deje el corazon en la casa
No es la primera vez que esto me pasa
Tu actitud lo he visto muchas veces
Por mas que disimule ya lo se se se

Se te nota que quieres de mi boca
Cuida'o que si te toca
No va a querer parar iai iai
Se te nota que estas pasa'o de copas
Cuida'o que te equivocas (Ey el Guaynaa Bichi, Lele Pons)
Y no te dejo probar iai iai

Lo que tu me diga I'm obey
Pero esta noche yo no ando lonely
Ando con el motherf... Toby
De pasajero que yo conduzco
Comiendome un vasito de molusco
Mandame el pin de tu corazon que yo lo busco
Se se le nota
Ma mamasota
Como lo mueve esa muchachota
Menea que se empalaga
Sacude que se empelota
Y es que yo lo se bebe se

Se me nota que quiero de tu boca
Si es que tu me provocas
Y me pones a temblar iar iar
Se te nota que bailando te alocas
Yo se que te sofoca mi manera de perriar iar iar

Stop ahi no te pases de la raya
Tranquilito si no quieres que me vaya
Te me puedes pegar
Pero te advierto que deje el corazon en la casa
No es la primera vez que esto me pasa
Tu actitud lo he visto muchas veces
Por mas que disimule ya lo se se se

Se te nota que quieres de mi boca
Cuida'o que si te toca
No va querer parar iai iai
Se te nota que bailando te alocas
Yo se que te sofoca mi manera de perriar iar iar

I could do it all my life

So tell me if you wanna
'Cause I got this feeling

You're breaking me

Spinning 'round inside this room

Won't you come on over
I'm a sucker for ya
Wishing we'll be out here soon

So tell me if you wanna
'Cause I got this feeling
I wanna hear you say it
Cause I can't believe it

(Woah-oh)
(El negrito de ojos claros)

Llevo tiempo diciendoselo, que algo mejor se merece
Perdiendo su tiempo sigue, sabiendo que no me pertenece
Y desde que la conoci se va con su amiga pa' la disco
Pero cuando le sube la nota, siempre vuelve a mi
Me dice "Vida mia, yo se que tengo que dejar que tu hagas tus locuras"

Tu mi locura, baby, pasan las horas y mas, me pide mas
No se cansa, parece no tener final
Lo nuestro es una locura
Tu mi locura baby, pasan las horas y mas, me pide mas
No se cansa, parece no tener final
Lo nuestro es una locura

Una locura, me encanta cuando lo hacemos en la Acura
Antes de llegar con la foto me tortura
Se vuelve loca si le aprieto la cintura
Ella es mi baby, se pasa toda la noche apretadita conmigo
Nadie sospecha porque ni por las redes la sigo
Solo somos amigos
Como Pique y Shakira
Yo en mi cama la cuido, mi baby
Se pasa toda la noche apretadita conmigo
Nadie sospecha porque ni por las redes la sigo
Solo somos amigos
Como Pique y Shakira
Yo en mi cama la cuido, mi baby

Tu mi locura, baby, pasan las horas y mas, me pide mas
No se cansa, parece no tener final
Lo nuestro es una locura
Tu mi locura, baby, pasan las horas y mas, me pide mas
No se cansa, parece no tener final
Lo nuestro es una locura

Siempre que escucho una cancion que me recuerda a ti
O una foto tuya atrevida que me llega a mi
Me activa el deseo, de ti me dan ganas
Y te llamo porque se que nunca hay traba
Tu misma me dices que lo nuestro es eternity
Porque ella es boyante no hace falta tu fatality
El de cinco letras, soy quien te penetra
Corleone cuando te lo hace high quality
Te pones insanity porque soy tu debility
En privacidad lo que tenemos es un reality
Hace' con tu vida lo que quiera y yo lo permiti
Pero tu me llama o yo te llamo y le caemos ahi

Dime  cual es el proposito?
Que vea tus videos como esta el esposito
Me tienes bien loquito
No entiendo cual es el problema
Si nos gustamos tanto,  cual es el dilema?

Estoy tentado a tocarte, tentado a pecar
Por mi te secuestro y de aqui no te vas
Pero si vuelve a mi
Me dice "Vida mia, yo se que tengo que dejar que tu hagas tus locuras"
Tentado a tocarte, tentado a pecar
Por mi te secuestro y de aqui no te vas
Pero si vuelve a mi
Me dice "Vida mia, yo se que tengo que dejar que tu hagas tus locuras"

Tu mi locura, baby, pasan las horas y mas, me pide mas
No se cansa, parece no tener final
Lo nuestro es una locura
Tu mi locura, baby, pasan las horas y mas, me pide mas
No se cansa, parece no tener final
Lo nuestro es una locura

El lado de tu cama que estaba caliente se esta congelando
Miro el telefono y todas tus fotos me estan torturando
No te olvido todavia
 Quien te dijo esa mentira?
Sabes que yo no te olvido
Yo no quiero alas pa' volar a otro lugar
Yo solamente quiero estar contigo

Dime ya,  por que?
Dime por que te fuiste, dimelo bebe
Dime ya,  por que?
 Por que no me llamas?  Es que no me extranas?
Dime,  por que?
Dime por que te fuiste, dimelo bebe
Dime ya,  por que?
 Por que no me llamas?  Es que no me extranas, bebe?

Mami, no te vayas, tu eres mi tesoro
Sin ti yo no vivo, mi amor, yo no como
A mis amigos en la calle no le hago coro
Yo llego volando donde ti, no demoro
Damelo hoy, no me digas tomorrow
Esa caderita y tu cuerpo devoro
Tu eres mi perla, diamante y tesoro
Lo que yo mas amo en el mundo y no es coro

Si, 'toy loco por volver a tenerte
Si, mi cama dice que eres mi suerte
Si, la unica que me ama y no es por lo que tengo
Hay algo tuyo que se viene donde mi pero no me detengo

Dime ya,  por que?
Dime por que te fuiste, dimelo bebe
Dime ya,  por que?
 Por que no me llamas?  Es que no me extranas?
Dime,  por que? ( Por que te fuiste?)
Dime por que te fuiste, dimelo bebe (No te me vayas)
Dime ya,  por que?
 Por que no me llamas?  Es que no me extranas, bebe?

Yo se que esa boca tuya
Solo quiere con la mia
Solo queda tu recuerdo pa' arroparme noche y dia

Yo se que esa boca tuya
Solo quiere con la mia
Una vida sin tus besos yo no se como seria

Dime ya,  por que?
Dime por que te fuiste, dimelo bebe
Dime ya,  por que?
 Por que no me llamas?  Es que no me extranas?
Dime,  por que?
Dime por que te fuiste, dimelo bebe
Dime ya,  por que?
 Por que no me llamas?  Es que no me extranas, bebe?

Convertimos el hotel en un putero
Veinticuatro horas no dan pa' lo que quiero
Baby, si tu fueras la muerte yo me muero, oh, oh

La noche grita sexo, oh, oh, oh
Adentro de esos labios, bebe, dejame preso
Te abro las dos piernas y te atravieso, ey

Baby, me gustaria comerte el dia completo
To' lo que yo te haria
Si el reloj nos diera mas tiempo
Baby, es que tu eres mia
Lo que te haria, eh-eh
Si el reloj nos diera mas tiempo
Baby, es que tu eres mia
Lo que te haria, eh-eh
Si el reloj nos diera mas tiempo

No es frontear, es aguantar
Cuando yo te lo meta
Operada las tetas
El miedo lo dejamos' en la gaveta
El abdomen es de atleta
Te lo juro que ese culo es de otro planeta

Tiene mahon mas apretado que un coso
Vin Diesel, yo le meto rapido y furioso
Tu me tiras la mala, dicen que yo soy mafioso
Porque tengo combo ya tu sabe' estan celoso'

Tu ere' una droga cuando mueve ese booty
Me tiene hookeao como tecato en el shooting
Ella perrea sola to' los clasicos de Luny
Yo le compre una Urus pa que vaya pa' al uni
Ella tiene novio y,  que paso?
Lo nego pero se envicio
Ahi vas con la fruta, cambiate de ruta
Cuando el te llame dile, "Fuck you, hijueputa"
(Real hasta la muerte,  prr!)

Baby, me gustaria comerte el dia completo
To' lo que yo te haria
Si el reloj nos diera mas tiempo
Baby, es que tu eres mia
Lo que te haria, eh-eh
Si el reloj nos diera mas tiempo

No hizo nada mal, pero quiere que la castigue
Y me como una munequita de anime
Como una serie pega' viendo me sigue
Y yo loco con verla mordiendo los cojines
Baby, tu matas, es que te pasas
Con esa foto si el va tu te afogatas
Te espero en casa
Te vo'a dar de lo que te arrebata
Cuando te vuelva a ver
Te voy a amarrar en la cama
Mi lengua por tu piel
Me gusta tenerte de espalda'
Tu no puedes mentirme
Yo se que a mi tu me amas
Tu me debes algo y lo sabes
No dejemos que esta noche se acabe
Que nadie sabe

Baby, me gustaria comerte el dia completo
To' lo que yo te haria
Si el reloj nos diera mas tiempo
Baby, es que tu eres mia
Lo que te haria, eh-eh
Si el reloj nos diera mas tiempo
Baby, es que tu eres mia

They say, "Oh my God, I see the way you shine
Take your hands, my dear, and place them both in mine"
You know you stopped me dead while I was passing by
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time

Ooh, I see you, see you, see you every time
And oh my, I, I like your style
You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time

Prisoner, prisoner
Locked up, can't get you off my mind, off my mind
Lord knows I tried a million times, million times, oh whoa
Why can't you, why can't you just let me go?

Strung out on a feeling, my hands are tied
Your face on my ceiling, I fantasize
Oh, I can't control it, I can't control it

I try to replace it with city lights
I'll never escape it, I need the high
Oh, I can't control it, I can't control it

You keep making it harder to stay
But I still can't run away
I gotta know why can't you
Why can't you just let me go?

Prisoner, prisoner
Locked up, can't get you off my mind, off my mind
Lord knows I tried a million times, million times, oh whoa

Locked up, can't get you off my mind, off my mind
Lord knows I tried a million times, million times, oh whoa

I tasted heaven now I can't live without it
I can't forget you and your love is the loudest
Oh, I can't control it, I can't control it

You keep making it harder to stay
But I still can't run away
I gotta know why can't you, why can't you just let me go?

Prisoner, prisoner

Golden, golden, golden
As I open my eyes
Hold it, focus, hoping
Take me back to the light
I know you were way too bright for me
I'm hopeless, broken
So you wait for me in the sky
Browns my skin just right

You're so golden
You're so golden
I'm out of my head
And I know that you're scared
Because hearts get broken

I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be alone
When it ends
Don't wanna let you know
I don't wanna be alone
But I, I can feel it take a hold
I can feel you take control
Of who I am and all I've ever known
Loving you's the antidote

Golden
You're so golden
I don't wanna be alone
You're so golden
You're so golden
I'm out of my head
And I know that you're scared
Because hearts get broken

(Golden, golden, golden, golden)
(Golden, golden, golden, golden)
(Golden, golden, golden, golden)
(Golden, golden, golden, golden)
(Golden, golden, golden, golden)
(Golden, golden, golden, golden)
I know that you're scared
Because I'm so open

You're so golden
I don't wanna be alone
You're so golden
You're so golden
You're so golden
I'm out of my head
And I know that you're scared
Because hearts get broken
---------------------------------------------------
Thought I found a way
Thought I found a way out (found)
But you never go away (never go away)
So I guess I gotta stay now

Oh, I hope someday I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear

Isn't it lovely? All alone
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home

Walking out of time
Looking for a better place (looking for a better place)
Something's on my mind
Always in my head space

But I know someday I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive outside I can't fight my fear

Isn't it lovely? All alone
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello. Welcome home

Whoa, yeah
Yeah, ah
Whoa, whoa
Hello, welcome home

Enviyon on the mix
No, no, no, no
No-no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you so I must replace you (oh)
Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listening to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but
I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you so I must replace you (oh)
Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listening to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but
I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head

I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past
But I want it to last
You were made outta plastic (fake)
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heart break

You made my heart break
You made my heart ache
(I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache
(Can't take back the love that I gave you)
You made my heart break
(Were made outta plastic fake)
You made my heart ache
(I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break again
(I was tangled up your drastic ways)
(Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?)

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you so I must replace you (oh)
Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listening to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but
I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you so I must replace you (oh)
Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listening to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but
I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

Leave this shit in the past but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic (fake)
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?

Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
(Instead of my head)
I won't let you forget me

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here
Next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here
Next year

Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm tryna play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
"Let It Snow" is blasting out
But I won't get in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know
It's true love that he thinks of
So next Christmas
I'm not all alone, boy

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here
Next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here
Next year

I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's Day I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling
Or if it's true love that he thinks of
So next Christmas
I'm not all alone, boy

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here
Next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here
Next year

Oh, I wanna have him beside me like oh-oh-oh
On the 25th by the fireplace, oh-oh-oh
But I don't want a new broken heart
This year I've got to be smart

Oh, baby
(Santa tell me)
If ya won't be
(Santa tell me)
If ya won't be here!
(Santa tell me)

Santa, tell me if you're really there (Santa tell me)
(If you're really there)
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here
Next year (He won't be here next year)
Santa, tell me if he really cares (Tell me)
(Tell me babe)
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here
Next year (He won't be here next year)

Santa, tell me if you're really there (Tell me)
(Tell me baby)
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here
Next year (If he won't be, if he won't be here)
Santa, tell me if he really cares (Tell me)
(Do you care)
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here (He won't be here next year)
Next year

Mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, uh
I can't breathe (Chopsquad), I can't breathe, 999
Waiting for the exhale
I toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well

I can't breathe, I'm waiting for the exhale
Toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well
Still no luck, but oh, well
I still try even though I know I'm gon' fail
Stress on my shoulders like an anvil
Perky got me itching like an anthill
Drugs killing me softly, Lauryn Hill
Sometimes I don't know how to feel

Ring-ring, phone call from depression
You used my past and my memories as a weapon
On the other line, I talk to addiction, huh
Speaking of the devil, all the drugs, I miss them
This can't be real, is it fiction?
Somethin' feels broke, need to fix it
I cry out for help, do they listen?
I'ma be alone until it's finished

This is the part where I tell you I'm fine
But I'm lying, I just don't want you to worry
This is the part where I take all my feelings and hide 'em
'Cause I don't want nobody to hurt me

I can't breathe, I'm waiting for the exhale
Toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well
Still no luck, but oh, well
I still try even though I know I'm gon' fail
It's stress on my shoulders like an anvil
Perky got me itching like an anthill
Drugs killing me softly, Lauryn Hill
Sometimes I don't know how to feel

Sometimes I don't know how to feel
Let's be for real
If it wasn't for the pills, I wouldn't be here
But if I keep taking these pills, I won't be here, yeah
I just told y'all my secret, yeah
It's tearing me to pieces
I really think I need them
I stopped taking the drugs and now the drugs take me

This is the part where I tell you I'm fine
But I'm lying, I just don't want you to worry
This is the part where I take all my feelings and hide 'em
'Cause I don't want nobody to hurt me

I can't breathe, I'm waiting for the exhale
Toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well
Still no luck, but oh, well
I still try even though I know I'm gon' fail
It's stress on my shoulders like an anvil
Perky got me itching like an anthill
Drugs killing me softly, Lauryn Hill
Sometimes I don't know how to feel

No lo quise aceptar, no (No, no)
Pero la tierra y tu tienen algo similar (Similar)
Me pusiste por el suelo, oh
Aunque no creia me pudiste afectar
No pusiste en agua to'a las rosa' que te di
Se secaron, parecen a ti
Mi cielo azul lo pusiste gris
Ojala y no te hagan lo que tu me hiciste a mi


Gozala
Que la vida es una, mami, gozala
Mira que este mundo da mil vueltas
Ojala y no llegues a mi puerta porque no te abrire
Pero, bebecita, gozala
Que la vida es una, mami, gozala
Mira que este mundo da mil vueltas
Ojala y no llegues a mi puerta porque no te abrire
Pero, bebecita


Parce, me dejaste solo
Y ahora estoy que me enamoro
De las nalguita' de esa chimbita
Cara de angel, pero maldita

Todo fue tu culpa, me saliste hija 'e puta
Me saliste media actriz
No sabia que era' astuta, babe
Todo fue tu culpa, me saliste hija 'e puta
Me saliste media actriz
No sabia que era' astuta, babe


Gozala
Que la vida es una, mami, gozala
Mira que este mundo da mil vueltas
Ojala y no vuelvas a mi puerta porque no te abrire
Pero, bebecita, gozala
Que la vida es una, mami, gozala
Mira que este mundo da mil vueltas
Ojala y no vuelvas a mi puerta porque no te abrire
Pero, bebecita, gozala


Porque yo me voy a gozar
Mejore' gata' que tu yo me voy a chingar
Una que me quiera y que me sea leal
No como tu, que no sirve', te supiste virar
Te solte en banda y ahora mi vida e' una parranda
Tu ere' do' colore' como un Panda
Ahora que venga, venga un bongazo
Ya no e' por amor que el pecho coge los cantazo' (No, no)


Gozala
Que la vida es una, mami, gozala
Mira que este mundo da mil vueltas
Ojala y no llegues a mi puerta porque no te abrire (Eh-eh)
Pero, bebecita, gozala
Que la vida es una, mami, gozala
Mira que este mundo da mil vueltas
Ojala y no llegues a mi puerta porque no te abrire


Ya no abran mas cristal en la suite presidencial, no
Nadie que te incline frente al mar
Y yo te ponia a gritar como naufrago perdido en el mar
Eso' momento' ya no vuelven a pasar (Wuh)

Todo fue tu culpa, me saliste hijueputa
Me saliste media actriz
No sabia que era' astuta
Todo fue tu culpa, me saliste hijueputa
Me saliste media actriz
No sabia que era' astuta


No lo quise aceptar, no (No, no, no, no)
Pero la tierra y tu tienen algo similar (Similar)
Me pusiste por el suelo, uoh
Aunque no creia me pudiste afectar


Gozala
Que la vida es una, mami, gozala
Mira que este mundo da mil vueltas
Ojala y no vuelvas a mi puerta porque no te abrire

Laying in the silence
Waiting for the sirens
Signs, any signs I'm alive still
I don't wanna lose it
But I'm not getting through this
Hey, should I pray, should I pray
Yeah, to myself, to a God?
To a saviour who can...

Unbreak the broken
Unsay these spoken words
Find hope in the hopeless
Pull me out of the train wreck
Unburn the ashes
Unchain the reactions
I'm not ready to die, not yet
Pull me out of the train wreck
Pull me out, pull me out, pull me out
Pull me out, pull me out

Underneath our bad blood
We still got a sanctum
Home, still a home, still a home here
It's not too late to build it back
'Cause a one in a million chance
Is still a chance, still a chance
And I would take those odds

Unbreak the broken
Unsay these spoken words
Find hope in the hopeless
Pull me out of the train wreck
Unburn the ashes
Unchain the reactions
I'm not ready to die, not yet
Pull me out of the train wreck
Pull me out, pull me out, pull me out
Pull me out, pull me out, pull me out

You can say what you like 'cause see, I would die for you
I'm down on my knees, and I need you to be my God
Be my help, be a saviour who can

Unbreak the broken
Unsay these reckless words
Find hope in the hopeless
Pull me out of the train wreck
Unburn the ashes
Unchain the reactions
I'm not ready to die, not yet
Pull me out of the train wreck
Pull me out, pull me out, pull me out
Pull me out, pull me out, pull me out

Savage love (685, baby)

If I woke up without ya, I don't know what I would do
Thought I could be single forever 'til I met you
Usually don't be fallin', be fallin', fallin' fast
You got a way of keepin' me comin' back-to-back
I just found out, the only reason that you lovin' me
Was to get back at your ex-lover but before you leave
Usually I would never, would never even care
Baby, I know she creepin', I feel it in the air

Every night and every day (Every day)
I try to make you stay, but your

Savage love, did somebody, did somebody break your heart?
Lookin' like an angel, but your savage love
When you kiss me, I know you don't give two fucks
But I still want that

Your savage love
Your savage lo-lo-love
Your savage lo-lo-love
You could use me 'cause I still want that (Your savage love)

Baby, I hope that this ain't karma 'cause I get around
You wanna run it up, I wanna lock it down
Usually don't be fallin', be fallin', fallin' fast
You got a way of makin' me spend up all my cash

Every night and every day (Every day)
I try to make you stay, but your

Savage love, did somebody, did somebody break your heart?
Lookin' like an angel, but your savage love
When you kiss me, I know you don't give two fucks

Deja de mentirte
La foto que subiste con el diciendo que era tu cielo
Bebe, yo te conozco tan bien, se que fue pa' darme celos
No te dire quien, pero llorando por mi te vieron, por mi te vieron

Dejame decirte
Se ve que el te trata bien, que es todo un caballero
Pero eso no cambiara que yo llegue primero
Se que te va ir bien, pero no te quiere como yo te quiero

Puede que no te haga falta na', aparentemente na'
Hawai de vacaciones, mis felicitaciones
Muy lindo en Instagram lo que posteas, pa' que yo vea
Como te va, pa' que yo vea

Puede que no te haga falta na', aparentemente na'
Hawai de vacaciones, mis felicitaciones
Muy lindo en Instagram lo que posteas, pa' que yo vea
Como te va de bien pero te haces mal, porque el amor no se compra con na'

Mientele a todos tus seguidores
Dile que los tiempos de ahora son mejores
No creo que cuando te llame me ignores
Si despues de mi ya no habra mas amores

Tu y yo fuimos uno
Lo haciamos en ayunas antes del desayuno
Fumabamos la hooka y te pasaba el humo
Y ahora en esta guerra no gana ninguno

Si me preguntas nadie tiene culpa
A veces los problemas a uno se le juntan
Dejame hablar, porfa, no me interrumpas
Si te hice algo malo entonces disculpame
La gente te lo va a creer, actuas bien ese papel, baby
Pero no eres feliz con el

Puede que no te haga falta na', aparentemente na'
Hawai de vacaciones, mis felicitaciones
Muy lindo en Instagram lo que posteas, pa' que yo vea
Como te va, pa' que yo vea

Puede que no te haga falta na', aparentemente na'

Sin que to' estos bobos te tiren

De a poquito-to
Que la musica sean tus gritos
Yo pegao ti como perrito
Siempre sucio mas nunca bonito

Que tal si te lo quito-to
De a poquito-to
Que la musica sean tus gritos
Yo pegao ti como perrito
Siempre sucio mas nunca bonito

Hay que buscar el squeegee por como se moja
Sucio como Luigi y se me sonroja
Siempre que le meto yo la dejo coja
Terminamos y enrolamos, buscate la hoja
Ese mahon tan apretao que te queda wow
Que te luce demasiao
Tu estas poseida porque tiene' un culo endemoniao
Te he dado muchas veces pero nunca he dicho que te he dado
Un secreto como Chemchy lo llevo guardado

Agresivo, te gusta si me pongo posesivo
Si en la cama duro te castigo
Siempre que te veo te lo digo

Que tal si te lo quito-to
De a poquito-to
Que la musica sean tus gritos
Yo pegao ti como perrito
Siempre sucio mas nunca bonito

Que tal si te lo quito-to
De a poquito-to
Que la musica sean tus gritos
Yo pegao ti como perrito
Siempre sucio mas nunca bonito

Debes sentir gratitud
El booty de tu mai lo heredaste tu, boo
Ninguna esta mas dura que tu
Con las otras yo la apago y contigo prendo la luz

Agresivo, te gusta si me pongo posesivo
Si en la cama duro te castigo
Siempre que te veo te lo digo

Como te pusiste esos jeanes (Jeanes)
Haces que mi mente maquine (Oh)
No te puedo sacar ni al cine
Sin que to' estos bobos te tiren

Que tal si te lo quito-to
De a poquito-to
Que la musica sean tus gritos
Yo pegao ti como perrito
Siempre sucio mas nunca bonito

Que tal si te lo quito-to
De a poquito-to
Que la musica sean tus gritos
Yo pegao ti como perrito
Siempre sucio mas nunca bonito

Mm
Hey, yeah
(That's just for fun)
(What?)
(I'm stuck with you)
Ah

I'm not one to stick around
One strike and you're out, baby
Don't care if I sound crazy
But you never let me down, no, no
That's why when the sun's up, I'm stayin'
Still layin' in your bed, singin'

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Got all this time on our hands
Might as well cancel our plans, yeah
I could stay here for a lifetime

So, lock the door and throw out the key
Can't fight this no more, it's just you and me
And there's nothin' I, nothin' I, I can do
I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you
So, go ahead and drive me insane
Baby, run your mouth, I still wouldn't change
Being stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you

There's nowhere we need to be, (no, no, no)
I'ma get to know you better
Kinda hope we're here forever

If you told me that the world's endin'
(Ain't no other way that I can spend it)


Oh, oh, oh, oh {Ooh}
Got all this (time in my hands)
Might as well (cancel our plans) {Yeah}, yeah
(I could stay here forever)


So, lock the door and throw out the key
Can't fight this no more, it's just you and me
And (there's nothin' I, nothin' I, I can do)
I'm (stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you)
So, (go ahead) and drive me insane
Baby, (run your mouth), I still wouldn't trade
Being (stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you)
I'm (stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you)


Whoa

We got all that we need {here tonight}

Stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you
---------------------------------------------------
I got room in my fumes (Yeah)
She fill my mind up with ideas
I'm the highest in the room (It's lit)
Hope I make it outta here (Let's go)

She saw my eyes, she know I'm gone (Ah)
I see some things that you might fear
I'm doin' a show, I'll be back soon (Soon)
That ain't what she wanna hear (Nah)
Now I got her in my room (Ah)
Legs wrapped around my beard
Got the fastest car, it zoom (Skrrt)
Hope we make it outta here (Ah)
When I'm with you, I feel alive
You say you love me, don't you lie (Yeah)
Won't cross my heart, don't wanna die

Turn it up 'til they can't hear (We can't)
Runnin', runnin' 'round for the thrill
Yeah, dawg, dawg, 'round my real (Gang)
Raw, raw, I been pourin' to the real (Drank)
Nah, nah, nah, they not back of the VIP (In the VIP)
Gorgeous, baby, keep me hard as steel
Ah, this my life, I did not choose
Uh, been on this since we was kids
We gon' stay on top and break the rules

Case it's fumes
She fill my mind up with ideas (Straight up)
I'm the highest in the room (I'm the highest, it's lit)

---------------------------------------------------
White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleeping, you're on your tippy toes
Creeping around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal

Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please, I do
What I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical

So you're a tough guy
Like-it-really-rough guy
Just-can't-get-enough guy
Chest-always-so-puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make-your-mama-sad type
Make-your-girlfriend-mad type
Might-seduce-your-dad type
I'm the bad guy, duh

I'm the bad guy

I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal

My mommy likes to sing along
With me but she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know

So you're a tough guy
Like-it-really-rough guy
Just-can't-get-enough guy
Chest-always-so-puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make-your-mama-sad type
Make-your-girlfriend-mad type
Might-seduce-your-dad type
I'm the bad guy, duh

I'm the bad guy, duh

I'm only good at being bad
Bad

I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad
That you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean
I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne

I'm a bad guy
I'm, I'm a bad guy
Bad guy, bad guy
I'm a bad guy
---------------------------------------------------
I wonder if I'm being real
Do I speak my truth or do I filter to how I feel?
I wonder, wouldn't it be nice
To live inside a world that isn't black and white?
I wonder what it's like to be my friends
Hope that they don't think I forget about them
I wonder
I wonder

Right before I close my eyes
The only thing that's on my mind
Been dreaming that you feel it too
I wonder what it's like to be loved by you
Yeah
I wonder what it's like
I wonder what it's like to be loved by...

I wonder why I'm so afraid
Of saying something wrong and never said I was a saint
I wonder when I cry into my hands
I'm conditioned to feel like it makes me less of a man
And I wonder if some day you'll be by my side
And tell me that the world will end up alright
I wonder
I wonder

Right before I close my eyes
The only thing that's on my mind
Been dreaming that you feel it too
I wonder what it's like to be loved by you
Yeah
I wonder what it's like
I wonder what it's like to be loved by you

I wonder what it's like to be loved by you
Yeah
I wonder what it's like to be loved by you
I wonder what it's like to be loved by...

Right before I close my eyes
The only thing that's on my mind
Been dreaming that you feel it too
I wonder what it's like to be loved by you

Shouldn't feel like a crime

Standing here alone now

Wishing that you were mine
Pull you in, it's alright

Me pregunto que traera puesto
Aunque saber no lo merezco
Tu me escribias y a veces te pichaba
Y ahora tu no respondes ni un texto

Vi la foto que subiste
Le di like, no se si lo viste
Recuerda el ultimo dia que en casa estuviste
Ese dia te convertiste

En mi polvo favorito
La baby que yo necesito
 Por que no vienes aqui ahora?
No quiero terminar asi
No quiero que duermas sola
Mi polvo favorito
La baby que yo necesito
 Por que no vienes aqui ahora?
No quiero terminar asi
No quiero que duermas sola

Tu a mi me curas, a las otras soy alergico
Vive en Los Angeles pero ella nacio en Mexico
Demonia que quiere dejarme paraplejico
Estoy enfermo de amor, bebe, busquen lo paramedicos
Mi polvo favorito
Si hacerlo es un delito
Que me metan preso que la llave la derrito
La baje pa' Puerto Rico
Siempre que yo bajo eso esta exquisito
Mami, yo te doy like y te respondo los history
Te contesto de una y tu me dejas en visto a mi
Me danaste la mente cuando esa foto en gistro vi
Y no se si yo te perdi, yo se que, bebe

Tu eres mi polvo favorito
La baby que yo necesito
 Por que no vienes aqui ahora?
No quiero terminar asi
No quiero que duermas sola
Mi polvo favorito
La baby que yo necesito
 Por que no vienes aqui ahora?
No quiero terminar asi
No quiero que duermas sola

Perdoname si te llame
Pero la calentura no me la aguante
Me tiene' hablando con Jesu'
 Por que en mi mente solo tu y tu?
Mi bellaquita y yo tu bellaquito
Sabe' que cuando empezamo' no me quito
Si fuera por mi todas las noche' lo' repito
Dale pa' aca, no te quiero de lejitos

Como cuando nos matabamos
To' los tiempos que bellaqueabamos
Porque siempre que peleabamos
En la cama se arreglaba todo

Tu eres mi polvo favorito
La baby que yo necesito
 Por que no vienes aqui ahora?
No quiero terminar asi
No quiero que duermas sola
Mi polvo favorito
La baby que yo necesito
 Por que no vienes aqui ahora?
No quiero terminar asi
No quiero que duermas sola

Man, what? (Haha)
This shit funny, one sec
Oof, this Hennessy strong as fuck, boy

She told me put my heart in the bag (In the bag)
And nobody gets hurt (No hurt)
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast (Fast)
So I'm making it worse (Making it worse)
Now I'm digging up a grave from my past
I'm a whole different person (I'm a whole different person)
It's a gift and a curse (It's a gift and a curse)
But I cannot reverse it

I can't reverse it
It was a gift and a curse
And now I'm drinkin' too much, so I'ma talk with a slur
Last time I saw you, it ended in a blur
I woke up in a hearse
You said, "You loved me first" (First)
One thing my dad told me was, "Never let your woman know when you're insecure"
So I put Gucci on the fur
And I put my wrist on iceberg
One thing my heart tells me is
"Flex on a ho every time they're insecure"
I guess you came through, I'm running from you
Is your love for real? (For real? For real?)
Is your love really true?

She told me put my heart in the bag (In the bag)
And nobody gets hurt (Hurt)
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast (Fast)
So I'm making it worse (Worse)
Now I'm digging up a grave from my past (Past)
I'm a whole different person (Person)
It's a gift and a curse (Curse)
But I cannot reverse it

You gave me the runaround
I really hate the runaround
You really got me paranoid
I always keep a gun around
You always give me butterflies
When you come around
When you come around
When you come around

You let me know love is not the answer
Not the answer, not the answer
I love to do drugs, so mind my manners
I get high when you don't decide to answer
Phone home, I need to phone home
I'm throwing rocks at your window, I need to go home
I don't wanna leave
I just wanna be with you
You, you, you

She told me put my heart in the bag (In the bag)
And nobody gets hurt (No hurt)
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast (Fast)
So I'm making it worse (I'm making it worse)
Now I'm digging up a grave from my past
I'm a whole different person (I'm a whole different person)
It's a gift and a curse (It's a gift and a curse)
But I cannot reverse it

 Que paso contigo?
Dimelo
 Rrrr
(Ovy on the Drums)

Ya no tiene excusa
Hoy salio con su amiga dizque pa' matar la tusa
Que porque un hombre le pago mal
Esta dura y abusa
Se canso de ser buena
Ahora es ella quien los usa
Que porque un hombre le pago mal
Ya no se le ve sentimental
Dice que por otro man no llora, no

Pero si le ponen la cancion
Le da una depresion tonta
Llorando lo comienza a llamar
Pero el la dejo en buzon
Sera porque con otra esta
Fingiendo que a otra se puede amar

Pero hice todo este llanto por nada
Ahora soy una chica mala

And now you kickin' and screamin', a big toddler
Don't try to get your friends to come holler
Holler, ay-oh, I used to lay low
I wasn't in the clubs, I was on my J.O.
Until I realized you a epic fail
So don't tell your guys that I'm still your bae, yo
'Cause it's a new day, I'm in a new place
Gettin' some new D, sittin' on a new face, OK
'Cause I know I'm the baddest bitch you ever really met
You searchin' for a badder bitch and you ain't met her yet

Ay yo, tell 'em to back off
He wanna slack off
Ain't no more booty calls
You gotta jack off
It's me and Karol G
We let them rats talk
Don't run up on us
cause they letting them MACs off (Brrr!)

Pero si le ponen la cancion
Le da una depresion tonta
Llorando lo comienza a llamar
Pero el la dejo en buzon
Sera porque con otra esta
Fingiendo que a otra se puede amar

Un shot pa' la pena profunda
Y seguimos gastando la funda
Otro shot pa' la mente
Pa' que el recuerdo no la atormente
Ya no le copia a nada
Su ex ya no vale nada
Se va pa' la disco y solo quiere perrear
Pero se confunde cuando empieza a tomar

Ella se cura con rumba
Y el amor pa' la tumba
To' los hombre' le zumban

Pero si le ponen la cancion
Le da una depresion tonta
Llorando lo comienza a llamar
Pero el la dejo en buzon
Sera porque con otra esta
Fingiendo que a otra se puede amar

Walk in your rainbow paradise
Strawberry lipstick state of mind
I get so lost inside your eyes
Would you believe it?

You don't have to say you love me
You don't have to say nothing
You don't have to say you're mine

Honey
I'd walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Oh honey
I'd walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do

You're wonder, under summer skies
Brown skin and lemon over ice
Would you believe it?

You don't have to say you love me
I just wanna tell you something
Lately you've been on my mind

Honey
I'd walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Oh honey
I'd walk through fire for you

You're lying to yourself and him to make me jealous (Oh, no)
You put on such an act when you're sleepin' together
All this 'cause I said I don't want marriage (Marriage)
I don't want marriage (Hey)

I'd rather go half on a baby
'Cause at least I know that it's not temporary (Temporary)
And at least we'll share something that's real (Oh, yeah)
I can tell that you're just tryna feel (Oh, no)

Puede que no te haga falta na', aparentemente na'
Hawai de vacaciones, mis felicitaciones
Muy lindo en Instagram lo que posteas (Oh, yeah)

Pa' que yo vea como te va de bien, pero te haces mal
Porque el amor no se compra con na'

Mientele a todos tus seguidores
Dile que los tiempos de ahora son mejores
No creo que cuando te llame me ignores
Si despues de mi ya no habran mas amores

Tu y yo fuimo' uno
Lo haciamo' en ayuna' antes del desayuno
Fumabamo' la hookah y te pasaba el humo
Y ahora en esta guerra no gana ninguno

Si me preguntas, nadie tiene culpa
A veces los problemas a uno se le juntan
Dejame hablar, porfa, no me interrumpas
Si te hice algo malo, entonces disculpame
La gente te lo va a creer, actuas bien ese papel (Yeah)
Baby, pero no eres feliz con el

Puede que no te haga falta na', aparentemente na'

I can't play that song 'cause it reminds me of you
I can't watch that show 'cause it reminds me of you
I can't even go there, it reminds me of you
I don't wanna do that, it reminds me of you
Cut off all of my friends 'cause they remind me of you
I can't drink again 'cause I'm reminded of you
I don't wanna do shit that reminds me of you
Everything and everywhere reminds me of you

I know we can't be together ever again
You told me this forever, I ain't know forever could end
You had me fucked up, had me thinkin' I would die here for you
Shit got me fucked up, can't believe I was so blinded by you
But I don't wanna cry
Got my finger on the trigger and I'm thinkin' 'bout a homicide
I feel like I could die
Baby, if it was all over, I could have you in another life

I can't play that song 'cause it reminds me of you
I can't watch that show 'cause it reminds me of you
I can't even go there, it reminds me of you
I don't wanna do that, it reminds me of you
Cut off all of my friends 'cause they remind me of you
I can't drink again 'cause I'm reminded of you
I don't wanna do shit that reminds me of you
Everything and everywhere reminds me of you


Gotta step out, get some fresh air
Posted in the club, saw you pull up with your rebound
Remind me again, uh, who kicked who out whose house?
Remind me again, who's fuckin' on who now?
Fightin' for my heart and baby, I ain't neverlose
No, I can't get high, 'cause it reminds me of you
If you ever needed me, girl, I was flyin' to you
Told you that I loved you, girl, I wasn't lyin' to you

Fightin' for my heart and baby, I ain't never lose
No, I can't get high, 'cause it reminds me of you
If you ever needed me, girl, I was flyin' to you
Told you that I loved you, girl, I wasn't lyin' to you


I can't play that song 'cause it reminds me of you
I can't watch that show 'cause it reminds me of you
I can't even go there, it reminds me of you
I don't wanna do that, it reminds me of you
Cut off all of my friends 'cause they remind me of you
I can't drink again 'cause I'm reminded of you
I don't wanna do shit that reminds me of you
Everything and everywhere reminds me of you
---------------------------------------------------
I'm in my bed
And you're not here
And there's no one to blame but the drink and my wandering hands

Forget what I said
It's not what I meant
And I can't take it back, I can't unpack the baggage you left

What am I now?
What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again
I'm falling again
I'm falling

What if I'm down?
What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again
I'm falling again
I'm falling

You said you cared
And you missed me too
And I'm well aware I write too many songs about you

And the coffee's out
At the Beachwood Cafe
And it kills me 'cause I know we've run out of things we can say

What am I now?
What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again
I'm falling again
I'm falling

What if I'm down?
What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again
I'm falling again
I'm falling

And I get the feeling that you'll never need me again

What am I now?
What am I now?
What if you're someone I just want around?
I'm falling again
I'm falling again
I'm falling

What if I'm down?
What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again
I'm falling again
I'm falling

It's like you got superpowers
Turn my minutes into hours
You got more than 20/20, babe
Made of glass, the way you see through me
You know me better than I do
Can't seem to keep nothing from you
How you touch my soul from the outside
Permeate my ego and my pride

I wanna love me (Ooh)
The way that you love me (Ooh)
Ooh, for all of my pretty and all of my ugly too
I'd love to see me from your point of view
I wanna trust me (Trust me)
The way that you trust me (Trust me)
Ooh, 'cause nobody ever loved me like you do
I'd love to see me from your point of view

I'm getting used to receiving
Still getting good at not leaving
I'ma love you even though I'm scared (Oh, scared)
Learnin' to be grateful for myself (Oh, oh, oh)
You love my lips 'cause they say the
Things we've always been afraid of
I can feel it startin' to subside
Learnin' to believe in what is mine

I wanna love me (Ooh)
The way that you love me (Ooh)
Ooh, for all of my pretty and all of my ugly too
I'd love to see me from your point of view
I wanna trust me (Trust me)
The way that you trust me (Trust me)
Ooh, 'cause nobody ever loved me like you do
I'd love to see me from your point of view

I couldn't believe it or see it for myself
Know I be impatient
But now I'm out here, fallin', fallin'
Frozen, slowly thawing, got me right
I won't keep you waitin', waitin'
All my baggage fadin' safely (My baggage fadin')
And if my eyes deceive me
Won't let them stray too far away

I wanna love me (Ooh)
The way that you love me (Ooh)
Ooh, for all of my pretty and all of my ugly too
I'd love to see me from your point of view
I wanna trust me, ooh (Trust me)
The way that you trust me, baby (Trust me)
'Cause nobody ever loved me like you do
I'd love to see me from your point of view (Oh)
Yeah

They're rotting my brain, love
These hoes are the same

I admit it, another hoe got me finished
Broke my heart, oh no you didn't
Fuck sippin', I'mma down a whole bottle
Hard liquor, hard truth can't swallow
Need a bartender, put me out my sorrow
Wake up the next day in the Monte Carlo
With a new woman
Tell me she from Colorado
And she love women
She'll be gone by tomorrow
Who am I kiddin'
All this jealousy and agony that I sit in
I'm a jealous boy, really feel like John Lennon
I just want real love, guess it's been a minute
Pissed off from the way that I don't fit in, I don't fit in
Tell me what's the secret to love, I don't get it
Feel like I be runnin' a race I'm not winnin'
Ran into the devil today and she grinnin'

Hey, these girls are insane
All girls are the same
They're rotting my brain, love
Think I need a change
Before I go insane, love
All girls are the same
They're rotting my brain, love
Think I need a change
Before I go insane, love

Ten minutes, she told me it would take ten minutes
To break my heart, oh no she didn't
Fuck living, Imma drown in my sorrow
Fuck giving, Imma take not borrow
And I'm still sinnin'
I'm still losing my mind
I know I been trippin'
I'm still wasting my time
All the time given, am I dying, am I living
It's fuck feelin's, my sorrow go up to the ceilin'

Now I am insane
Demons in my brain, love
Peace I can't obtain
Cause all these girls the same, love
Now I am insane
Demons in my brain, love
Peace I can't obtain
Cause all these girls the same, love

This is all we got
Dreaming 'bout a revolution in our minds
This is all we got

Lock me out of this life institution
I am angry and high on illusions
Yes I hate, but it's not a solution
Try my best, but hey I'm just a human, oh

We don't need to say we're sorry
We don't need to worship heaven's art
We don't need to say we're sorry
So where's the love?

This is all we got
Dreaming 'bout a revolution in our minds
This is all we got
Talking 'bout our resolutions getting high
We don't need a lot
And we don't care if we fuck it up
If it's what we got
Then why not give it all we got?

I can see in your eyes you're defeated
Try to fool yourself till you believe it
That you're better off numb and not feeling
But there's a sky if you jump through the ceiling, oh

We don't need to say we're sorry
We don't need to worship heaven's art
We don't need to say we're sorry
So where's the love?

This is all we got
Dreaming 'bout a revolution in our minds
This is all we got
Talking 'bout our resolutions getting high
We don't need a lot
And we don't care if we fuck it up
If it's what we got
Then why not give it all we got? (we got)
Then why not give it all we got? (we got)

Lock me out of this life institution, no

Start liftin' up your dress, start kissin' on your neck (Oh no, no)
Start rubbin' on your butt, start massagin' your breasts

You know, I never found love until I looked between your eyes (Between your eyes)
First time blushin', I ain't even gon' lie (Ain't even gon' lie)
Full round ten, leavin' bruises on your thighs
You the only bitch could make me spin off on the guys
And the only bitch that make me wanna nut when I'm inside
It's your vibe, leave with me you gettin' high
Plenty bitches fuckin' with you even if they tried
Pussy on tsunami, I ain't never felt it dry
Close my eyes while I sleep, hope you be there when I wake
Honestly, I feel the vibe we have is great
And if there's something in your mind, you can tell me
And if I told you what's on mine, would you help me?
See the bigger picture, it's just gon' take time
That's because you mine
I'ma keep you lookin' like a dime
Ain't no imperfections, girl, you fine
Baby, what's your sign?
Hope you went and guessed, just slow down
(Work, work, it's me and you) Me and you
Keep it silent, there ain't nothin' we can't do
Through the storm, baby, we can make it through
Why you actin' brand new? You know you my lil' boo, yeah
Got up on my Birkin, it's workin'
She said she a virgin (It's hurtin')
She my biggest fan, she always lurkin'
She know I'm a man, I'ma put that work in
I know she can't stand me, I'm fancy

Late night sex, she can't find her panties
Couldn't hold it in, now she need a plan B

Ayy
You know my ex so that makes it all feel complicated, yeah
(It all seems complicated)
I read those texts that you sent to yours but I'll never say it, yeah
(I'll never say it)


You walked in my life at 2 AM
'Cause my boy's new girl is your best friend
Act like you don't see me, we'll play pretend
Your eyes already told me what you never said

Now we're in the back seat of the black car going home
When she asked me, "Is it wrong if I come up with you?"
We're both drunk on the elevator when I kissed you for the first time in New York City, uh

I swear to God, I never fall in love
Then you showed up and I can't get enough of it
I swear to God, I never fall in love
I never fall in love but I can't get enough of it (Yeah)


First off, I'm not sorry
I won't apologize to nobody
You play like I'm invisible
Girl, don't act like you ain't saw me
Last year was a mess and how I acted was beyond me
But the past still revolves me
You text me, I ain't responding
But now shit's done changed
Go our separate ways
But look at this damage you did to me
I still want nothing to do between you and me
Please, don't say nothing at all
Sounds so true to me
We don't got nothing to say, hey


I swear to God, I never fall in love
Then you showed up and I can't get enough of it
I swear to God, I never fall in love
I never fall in love, but I can't get enough of it (Yeah)
I swear to God (I swear to God), I never fall in love
Then you showed up and I can't get enough of it (I can't get enough of you)
I swear to God (I swear to God), I never fall in love (In love)
I never fall in love, but I can't get enough of it (I can't get enough of it, yeah)

You don't wanna see me bratty
Pet the kitty, call me catty
Make your man call me daddy
He talk too much, he's too chatty (not cool)
CEO, I'm savvy
Respect a bitch, I'm a maverick
Flexible, so elastic
But don't you dare bend a bitch backwards

Fuck a princess, I'm a king
Bow down and kiss on my ring
Being a bitch is my kink
What the fuck else did you think?
Fuck a princess, I'm a king
Bow down and kiss on my ring
It's gonna hurt, it'll sting
Spitting up blood in the sink

I'm crazy, but you like that
I bite back, daisies on your nightstand
Never forget, I blossom in the moonlight
Screw eyes, glacial with the blue ice
I'm terrifying

I'm no Cinderella, but I like the shoes
Big glass platforms, bitch, I'm choosy
Long blue hair, blue as a bruise
Only trust a fella for some light amusement
I'm no prey, but I am pursued
Pray for me, nana, on the church's pews
No dickstraction, can confuse me
Whiskey in my hip flask, nothing fruity

Fuck a princess, I'm a king
Bow down and kiss on my ring
Being a bitch is my kink
What the fuck else did you think?
Fuck a princess, I'm a king
Bow down and kiss on my ring
It's gonna hurt, it'll sting
Spitting up blood in the sink

I'm crazy, but you like that
I bite back, daisies on your nightstand
Never forget, I blossom in the moonlight
Screw eyes, glacial with the blue ice
I'm terrifying

I'm crazy but you like that
I bite back, daisies on your nightstand
Never forget, I blossom in the moonlight
Screw eyes, glacial with the blue ice
I'm terrifying

I'm terrifying
I'm terrifying

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Every couple tries to stop

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling

You will get a sentimental feeling
When you hear
Voices singing let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone dancing merrily
In the new old-fashioned way

You will get a sentimental feeling
When you hear
Voices singing let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone dancing merrily
In the new old fashioned way

Take you like a drug
I taste you on my tongue

You ask me what I'm thinking about
I tell you that I'm thinking about
Whatever you're thinking about (Ah)
Tell me something that I'll forget
And you might have to tell me again
It's crazy what you'll do for a friend

Go ahead and cry, little girl
Nobody does it like you do
I know how much it matters to you
I know that you got daddy issues
And if you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I know that you got daddy issues, and I do too

I tried to write your name in the rain
But the rain never came
So I made with the sun
The shade
Always comes at the worst time (Ah)

You ask me what I'm thinking about
I tell you that I'm thinking about
Whatever you're thinking about
Tell me something that I'll forget
And you might have to tell me again
It's crazy what you'll do for a friend

Go ahead and cry, little girl
Nobody does it like you do
I know how much it matters to you
I know that you got daddy issues
And if you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I know that you got daddy issues

I keep on trying to let you go
I'm dying to let you know
How I'm getting on
I didn't cry when you left at first
But now that you're dead it hurts
This time I gotta know
Where did my daddy go?
I'm not entirely here
Half of me has disappeared

Go ahead and cry, little boy
You know that your daddy did too
You know what your mama went through
You gotta let it out soon, just let it out

Go ahead and cry, little girl
Nobody does it like you do
I know how much it matters to you
I know that you got daddy issues
And if you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I know that you got daddy issues, and I do too

If you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I know that you got daddy issues, and I do too

First things first
I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh ooh
The way that things have been, oh ooh

Second things second
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh ooh
The master of my sea, oh ooh

I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Third things third
Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh ooh
Your spirit up above, oh ooh

I was choking in the crowd
Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
Till it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...

Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Last things last
By the grace of the fire and the flames
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh ooh
The blood in my veins, oh ooh
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
Till it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...

Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

I know you so well, so well
I mean, I can do anything that he can
I've been pretty...


I know you're somewhere, somewhere
I've been trapped in my mind, girl, just holding on
I don't wanna pretend we're something, we're nothing
I've been stuck thinking 'bout her, I can't hold on (I'll be feeling)

I'm in pain, wanna put ten shots in my brain
I've been trippin' 'bout some things, can't change
Suicidal, same time I'm tame
Picture this, in bed, get a phone call
Girl that you fucked with killed herself
That was this summer when nobody helped
And ever since then, man, I hate myself
Wanna fuckin' end it, pessimistic
All wanna see me with no pot to piss in
But niggas been excited 'bout the grave I'm diggin'
Havin' conversations 'bout my haste decisions
Fuckin' sickenin'; at the same time
Memories surface through the grapevine
'Bout my uncle playin' with a slip knot
Post-traumatic stress got me fucked up
Been fucked up since the couple months they had a nigga locked up

I'll be feelin' pain, I'll be feelin' pain just to hold on
And I don't feel the same, I'm so numb
I'll be feelin' pain, I'll be feelin' pain just to hold on
And I don't feel the same, I'm so numb


I know you so well (I know you, girl)
I mean, I can do better than he can
I've been pretty...
I know you so well
---------------------------------------------------
I met you in the dark
You lit me up
You made me feel as though
I was enough
We danced the night away
We drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute I was stone-cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told you
I think that you should get some rest

I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you
But I never showed
But I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I'll wake you up with some
Breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee
With a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars
For that night

When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that every day you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling, your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far, my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me
When I needed you most

I'm gonna love you 'til
My lungs give out
I promise 'til death we part
Like in our vows
So I wrote this song for you
Now everybody knows
That it's just you and me
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

Just say you won't let go
Oh, just say you won't let go

(Ride it, we're all alone)
(Ride it, just lose control)
(Ride it, ride it, come touch my soul)
(Ride it, ride it, let me feel you)
Ride it, turn the lights down low
Ride it, from head to toe
Ride it, ride it, come touch my soul
Ride it, ride it, let me feel you

It's been about a month and twenty days
And we're going 'round and 'round, just playing silly games
Now you're saying, slow it down, not right now
Then ya wink at me and walk away
Now, let it be, let it be, let it be known
Hold on, don't go
Touching and teasing me, telling me no
But this time I need to feel you

Ride it, we're all alone
Ride it, just lose control
Ride it, ride it, come touch my soul
Ride it, ride it, let me feel you
Ride it, turn the lights down low
Ride it, from head to toe
Ride it, ride it, come touch my soul
Ride it, ride it, let me feel you

Movida was the club on Saturday
Ya actin' like a diva, sayin' you don't wanna pay
It's gotta be ya feisty style, raised eyebrow
I love it when you look at me that way
Now we're in, you order a mojito at the bar
We applying lippy cause it came off from the glass
The DJ plays your favorite song, Kanye's on
Now ya beckoning for me to dance
Mmm, pullin' me, pullin' me, pullin' me close
Just close your eyes, girl
Whispering, tellin' me we gotta go
Won't you take me home, I wanna

Ride it, we're all alone
Ride it, just lose control
Ride it, ride it, come touch my soul
Ride it, ride it, let me feel you
Ride it, turn the lights down low

---------------------------------------------------
Wait right here
I'll be back in the mornin'
I know that I'm not that important to you
But to me, girl, you're so much more than gorgeous
So much more than perfect (yeah)
Right now I know that I'm not really worth it
If you give me time, I could work on it
Give me some time while I work on it

Losin' your patience, and, girl, I don't blame you
The Earth's in rotation, you're waitin' for me
Look at my face, when I fuck on your waist
'Cause we only have one conversation a week

That's why your friends always hatin' on me
Fuck 'em though, I did this all by myself
Matter fact, I ain't never asked no one for help
And that's why I don't pick up my phone when it rings

None of my exes is over Lil Peep
Nobody flexin' as much as I be
That's why she text me and tell me she love me
She know that someday I'll be over the sea

Makin' my money and smokin' my weed
I think it's funny, she open up to me, get comfortable with me
Once I got it comin', I love her, she love me
I know that I'm nothing like someone her family want me to be
If I find a way, would you walk it with me?
Look at my face while you talkin' to me
'Cause we only have one conversation a week

Can I get one conversation at least?
Shout out to everyone makin' my beats, you helpin' me preach
This music's the only thing keepin' the peace when I'm fallin' to pieces

Look at the sky tonight, all of the stars have a reason
A reason to shine, a reason like mine and I'm fallin' to pieces
Look at the sky tonight, all of the stars have a reason

Jason Derulo
Oh
Ooh

Bust it open for a gift
I put diamonds on your wrist
I can't buy your lovin'
It's never enough
I took that girl on a trip
'Cause we was arguin'
Ever since we stopped touchin'
We're not in touch

I know money can't buy, buy, buy your love
I guess I didn't try, try hard enough
But we could work this like a nine-to-five
(Whoa-oh)
Mama told me stop playin', playin' all the games
Steady throwin' dollars expectin' change
But every war ends the same

Can we just
Make love
Not war?
Oh

Can we just
Make love
Not war?
Oh

I solve my problems with a check
Now I'm payin' for it
You wanted nothin', uh
Nothin' but love
I can't lie, I'm a mess
I'm too jealous, yes
It's so hard to trust you
When I don't trust myself

I know money can't buy, buy, buy your love
I guess I didn't try, try hard enough
But we could work this like a nine-to-five (Oh-whoa)
Mama told me stop playin', playin' all the games
Steady throwin' dollars expectin' change
But every war ends the same

Can we just
Make love
Not war?
Oh

Can we just
Make love
Not war?
Oh

And my people say
(Oh) Oh-whoa (Oh)
Let's just try some lovin', babe
'Cause shawty, I know

I know money can't buy, buy, buy your love
I guess I didn't try, try hard enough
Girl, we could work it like a nine-to-five-five-five, whoa-oh, baby
Mama told me stop playin', playin' all the games (Stop playin' the games)
Steady throwin' dollars expectin' change
But every war ends the same

Can we just
Make love
Not war?
Oh, babe

Can we just
Make love
Not war?
Oh

Not war, babe
---------------------------------------------------
I found a love for me
Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me

'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes you're holding mine

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess
I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it,
Darling, you look perfect tonight

Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

We are still kids but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favourite song
When I saw you in that dress
Looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this
Darling, you look perfect tonight

No, no, no

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favourite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight

She said, "Where we goin'?" I said, "The moon"

Now here you go again
You say you want your freedom
Well, who am I to keep you down?
It's only right that you should
Play the way you feel it
But listen carefully to the sound
Of your loneliness

Like a heartbeat... drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost...
And what you had...
And what you lost

Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Say... Women... they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean... you'll know, you'll know

Now here I go again, I see the crystal visions
I keep my visions to myself
It's only me
Who wants to wrap around your dreams and...
Have you any dreams you'd like to sell?
Dreams of loneliness...

Like a heartbeat... drives you mad...
In the stillness of remembering what you had...
And what you lost...
And what you had...
And what you lost

Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Women they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know

Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Say women they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know, you'll know
You will know, you'll know

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly (Fly)
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried (Cried, cried, cried, cried)
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care (Might care, might care)

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

And you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'"

I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

And you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'"

If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?

Live for the minor event, I finally slip
Built on the bodies of men, nobody winning
Contain what I'm bottling in just benefits them

Shawty gon' get that paper
Shawty tongue rip like razor
Shawty got with, got flavor
Pardon my tits and make-up, uh, uh, pay her
Dribble then hit that lay up
Shawty ain't with them games, yeah
Shawty gon' get that paper, pay her

I been trying not to go off the deep end
I don't think you wanna give me a reason
I been trying not to go off the deep end
I don't think you wanna give, give me
---------------------------------------------------
I love you, baby, and if it's quite all right
I need you, baby, to warm these lonely nights

Can I call you baby? Can you be my friend?
Can you be my lover up until the very end?
Let me show you love, oh, no pretend
Stick by my side even when the world is caving in, yeah

Oh, oh, oh, don't, don't you worry
I'll be there whenever you want me

I need somebody who can love me at my worst
No, I'm not perfect, but I hope you see my worth
'Cause it's only you, nobody new, I put you first
And for you, girl, I swear I'd do the worst

Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

If you stay forever, let me hold your hand
I can fill those places in your heart no one else can
Let me show you love, oh, no pretend, yeah
I'll be right here, baby, you know it's sink or swim

Oh, oh, oh, don't, don't you worry

No, I'm not perfect, but I hope you see my worth
'Cause it's only you, nobody new, I put you first
And for you, girl, I swear I'd do the worst
---------------------------------------------------
The mirror's image
Tells me it's home time
But I'm not finished
'Cause you're not by my side
And as I arrived I thought I saw you leaving
Carrying your shoes
Decided that once again I was just dreaming
Of bumping into you

Now it's three in the morning and I'm trying to change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls and to my message you reply
"Why'd you only call me when you're high?
Hi, why'd you only call me when you're high?"

Somewhere darker
Talking the same shite
I need a partner (hey)
Well, are you out tonight?
It's harder and harder to get you to listen
More I get through the gears
Incapable of making alright decisions
And having bad ideas

Now it's three in the morning and I'm trying to change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls and to my message you reply (message you reply)
"Why'd you only call me when you're high? (why'd you only call me when you're high?)
Hi, why'd you only call me when you're high?"

And I can't see you here wonder where I might?
Sort of feels like I'm running out of time
I haven't found what I was hoping to find
You said, "You gotta be up in the morning, gonna have an early night
And you're starting to bore me, baby
Why'd you only call me when you're high?"

Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
---------------------------------------------------
Ugh, you're a monster

can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I'll feel like Godzilla
Better hit the deck like the card dealer
My whole squad's in here, walking around the party
A cross between a zombie apocalypse and B-Bobby "The
Brain" Heenan which is probably the
Same reason wrestle with mania
Shady's in this bitch, posse'd up
Consider it to cross me a costly mistake
they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia
ADHD, Hydroxycut
Pass the Courvoisier (Hey, hey)
In AA with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate
Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday
This beat is cray-cray, Ray J,
Laughing all the way to the bank, I spray flames
They cannot tame or placate the

Monster
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet

just a product of Slick Rick and Onyx, told 'em lick the balls
Had 'em just appalled, did so many things that pissed 'em off
It's impossible to list 'em all
And in the midst of all this
in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal, voices whisper
My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on a guy with a missile launcher
I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological
Quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of vodka
When you twist the top of the bottle, I'm a

Monster
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet

If you never gave a damn (Ayy), raise your hand
'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans
I'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is
The motherfuckin' finger (Finger), prostate exam ('Xam)
How can I have all these fans and perspire?
Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flyer
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers
And what goes around comes around just like the blades on the chainsaw
'Cause I caught the flack, but my dollars stacked right off the bat like a baseball
Like Kid Ink, bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy
'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake, yeah)
Bitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher
Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her
Face in my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez
Cristhian Rivera, 'cause my lyrics never sit well
So they wanna give me the chair
Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Hari Kari
'Cause e'ry Tom and Dick and Harry carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary on 'em
Swearing up and down they can spit, this shit's hilarious
It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column
We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem
Get the shaft like a steering column (Monster)
Trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink
Evil half of the Bad Meets
Evil, that means take a back seat
Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi single
Look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people
Is my 'Gangsta Bitch' like Apache with a catchy jingle
I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em
Other words, I Minute Maid 'em
I don't wanna hurt 'em, but I did, I'm in a fit of rage
I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade
I'm finna kill 'em and dump all their fuckin' bodies in the lake
Obliterating everything, incinerate a renegade
I'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill
I'm Attila, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla
You're bringin' the killer within me outta me
You don't wanna be the enemy of the demon who entered me
And be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be
Every bit of me's the epitome of a spitter
When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck
Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me
A hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me
I'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you, bitch, I'm unfadable
You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowin' up like an inflatable
I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable
I'm on the toilet bowl, I got a trailer full of money and I'm paid in full
I'm not afraid to pull a 

Man, stop
Look what I'm plannin', haha
---------------------------------------------------
Yeah
Breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things

Yeah
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who would have thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)

My wrist, stop watchin'
My neck is flossy
Make big deposits
My gloss is poppin'

You like my hair?
Gee, thanks! Just bought it
I see it, I like it

Gee, thanks! Just bought it

(Yep)

Wearin' a ring but ain't gon' be no "Mrs."
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction

Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, "Which one?" I say, "Nah, I want all of 'em"
Happiness is the same price as "red-bottoms"

My smile is beamin' (yeah)
My skin is gleamin' (is gleamin')
The way it shine
I know you've seen it
You've seen it

I bought a crib
Just for just for the closet closet
Both his and hers

Baby

Gee, thanks! Just bought it
Oh, yeah

Yep

Yeah, my receipts be lookin' like phone numbers
If it ain't money, then wrong number
Black Card is my business card
The way it be settin' the tone for me

I don't mean to brag
But I be like, "Put it in the bag"
Yeah
When you see them racks
They stacked up like my ass
Yeah

Shoot
Go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop
Gimme the loot
Never mind, I got the juice
Nothin' but net when we shoot

Look at my neck
Look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it then that's what I get
Yeah

I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
(Oh yeah)
Yeah
I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
Oh, yeah, yeah

You like my hair?
Gee, thanks! Just bought it
I see it, I like it
I want it, I got it
(I see, yep)
---------------------------------------------------
Woah

Oh, oh-oh, oh (Mello made it right, uh)

I try to be everything that I can
But sometimes I come out as bein' nothin'
I try to be everything that I can
But sometimes I come out as bein' nothin'
I pray to God that he make me a better man (Uh)
Maybe one day I'ma stand for somethin'
I'm thankin' God that he made you part of the plan
I guess I ain't go through all that Hell for nothin'
I'm always fuckin' up and wreckin' shit, it seems like I perfected it
I offer you my love, I hope you take it like some medicine
You tell me, ain't nobody better than me
I think that there's better than me
Hope you see the better in me
Always end up betterin' me

I don't wanna ruin this one
This type of love don't always come and go

This type of love don't always come and go

I don't wanna ruin this one
This type of love don't always come and go
I don't wanna ruin this one
This type of love don't always come and go

We take drugs then you hold me close
Then I tell you how you make me whole
Sometimes I feel you like bein' alone
Then you tell me that I shoulda stayed in the room
Guess I got it all wrong, all along, my fault
My mistakes prolly wipe all the rights I've done
Sayin' goodbye to bygones, those are bygones
Head up, baby stay strong, we gon' live long

I don't wanna ruin this one
This type of love don't always come and go
I don't wanna ruin this one
This type of love don't always come and go
I don't wanna ruin this one
This type of love don't always come and go
I don't wanna ruin this one
This type of love don't always come and go

I don't wanna ruin this one
This type of love don't always come and go
I don't wanna ruin this one
This type of love don't always come and go (Go, go)

Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And everything you do
Yeah, they were all yellow

I came along
I wrote a song for you
And all the things you do
And it was called "Yellow"

So then I took my turn
Oh what a thing to have done
And it was all yellow

Your skin
Oh yeah your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
Do you know
You know I love you so
You know I love you so

I swam across
I jumped across for you
Oh what a thing to do
'Cause you were all yellow

I drew a line
I drew a line for you
Oh what a thing to do

---------------------------------------------------
Ya no confio en tu mirada
Y tus besos no saben igual, eh
Queda algo pero casi nada
Y el amor no se trata de intentar, eh

Ya no se siente igual cuando hacemos el amor
Tratar de olvidar, ese ha sido nuestro error
Porque hay heridas que no sanan
De la noche a la manana
Eh, eh-eh, eh, eh

Y si ya se acabo
No lo ocultes, dimelo
No lo hagas peor
Haciendo que me amas
Haciendo que me amas

Y si ya se acabo
No lo ocultes, dimelo
No lo hagas peor
Haciendo que me amas
Haciendo que me amas
Ey, ey

Recuerdo el dia en que te conoci
Tu sonrisa despues de decir que si
Me besaste y en el aire me meci
Tenia poco, pero todo te ofreci
Y esta cabron, han pasado tantos anos
Desde que te conozco y de nuevo somos dos extranos
Tus primeros besos los extrano
Los polvo' en la cocina y en el bano
Las noches de cine y cena para dos
Tus "te amo" se oyen raro, te ha cambiado hasta la voz
Me siento hasta pendejo, creyendome to' lo que deciamos
Pero es verdad, es tiempo de decir adios
Ey, ey

No se quien tuvo la culpa, pero ya ni viene el caso
Devuelveme mi corazon, aunque sea en pedazos, ey
Que yo lo pego paso a paso
Pero ya sueltame en banda que me atraso
Por el bien tuyo, por el bien mio
Tu sabes que esto del amor termina en lio
Si te veo con otro te sonrio
Pa' que odiarnos despues de lo que hemos vivido
Uno nace solo y solo se muere
Se comparte, se disfruta, se ama y se quiere
Pero nunca te olvides de quien tu eres
Nah, nah
Ni por hombre, ni mujeres
Eh
---------------------------------------------------
Yeah

The ones that hate me the most look just like me
You tell me what that means
Make a slick comment and see what that brings
I seen it go down, we can reenact things
Extreme like BMXing
These boys pussy and they PMSing
People in the city see the movement occurring
And say, "My God, I wanna be in that scene"
Damn right, you wanna be in this scene
She at the video tryna be in this scene
Used to fantasize 'bout bein' this seen (Seen)
Bluegrass girl but she got big dreams
Can't touch me, I got instincts
Locked in the house, but I'm plottin' things
I brought a gang to the party with me
Five white boys but they not NSYNC (Yeah, woo)

Fuck what y'all think
Fuck everything that you say about me
My dawgs like to play Madden and 2K
But one thing they don't do is play about me
My homeboy Tyler, he play in South Beach
He told me this summer he gon' fix my jumper
I told Boi-1da that we might got a thumper
I been tryna pop, now I'm on like Shumpert (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Now they on my bumper
Green room chock-full of all my comforts
Hotel room like heaven on earth
Got angels in my bed with some all-white covers
Ace Pro, Nemo, Lucci and Quiiso, Shloob, Clay, 2for
And I got a few more I call my brothers
I got a lot of flows and they all like butter, ooh (Ah)
You know what that means
I came home nice, but I'm goin' back mean
I'm 'bout to globe-trot when they know a vaccine
Motherfuckers act lost, but they know exactly what's goin' on
Made a mil' and I don't know what to blow it on
I tell the critics, "Shut up," like my show is on
Gave a T-shirt to her, said, "Throw it on"
She one of many high school classmates I'm growin' on (Growin' on, growin' on)
My peers ain't poppin', they don't know what's goin' wrong
Y'all well dressed, but you ain't got soul and you just can't sew it on
I'm tryna tell y'all boys, I got a few songs I could sell y'all boys
I tried it back then, it was, "Hell nah, boy" (Nah)
Now I'm in a box like a Kellogg's toy (Like a, like a, ooh)

The ones that hate me the most look just like me (Like me)
You tell me what that means

That's my type of distraction, that's my type and she Latin (That's facts, ooh)
Got my own flow and I'm 'bout to get a patent
Brand new sheets for the bed, they satin (Soft, real soft)
Y'all wasn't tuned in back then (Nah)
My swag, they keep jackin' (Keep on jackin')
I ain't doin' no verse, quit askin' (Quit askin')

What's poppin'? (Pooh, you a fool for this one)
Brand new whip just hopped in (Just hopped in)
I got options
I could pass that bitch like Stockton (It ain't nothin')
Just joshin'
I'ma spend this holiday locked in (Ooh)
My body got rid of them toxins (Mmh, mmh)
SportsCenter, top ten
---------------------------------------------------
You booked the night train for a reason
So you could sit there in this hurt
Bustling crowds or silent sleepers
You're not sure which is worse

Because I dropped your hand while dancing
Left you out there standing
Crestfallen on the landing
Champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
My picture in your wallet
Your heart was glass, I dropped it
Champagne problems

You told your family for a reason
You couldn't keep it in
Your sister splashed out on the bottle
Now no one's celebrating

Dom Perignon, you brought it
No crowd of friends applauded
Your hometown skeptics called it
Champagne problems
You had a speech, you're speechless
Love slipped beyond your reaches
And I couldn't give a reason
Champagne problems

Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
November flush and your flannel cure
"This dorm was once a madhouse"
I made a joke, "Well, it's made for me"
How evergreen, our group of friends
Don't think we'll say that word again
And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
That we once walked through
One for the money, two for the show
I never was ready, so I watch you go
Sometimes you just don't know the answer
'Til someone's on their knees and asks you
"She would've made such a lovely bride
What a shame she's fucked in the head," they said
But you'll find the real thing instead
She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred

And hold your hand while dancing
Never leave you standing
Crestfallen on the landing
With champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
Her picture in your wallet
You won't remember all my
Champagne problems

You won't remember all my
Champagne problems
---------------------------------------------------
Ooh, ahh, ahh, ahh
Don't go, don't go to sleep
Don't go, stay up and


Tired of feelin' like I'm trapped in my damn mind
Tired of feelin' like I'm wrapped in a damn lie
Tired of feelin' like my life is a damn game
Nigga really wanna die in the night time

Only time I feel pain, when I'm feelin' love
That's why it's tatted on my face that I'm damn numb
Only tell you 'bout my mind when I'm all alone
That's why I'm never really 'lone in the night time
Change hoes like clothes, I can't get attached
'Cause these hoes fire starters like lit matches
I've been feelin' really lost, duckin' all attachments
I don't really go outside 'cause I hate traffic
I don't wanna go outside, get caught in traffic, traffic


Ooh, ahh, ahh, ahh
Don't go, don't go to sleep
Don't go, stay up and


Tired of feelin' like I'm trapped in my damn mind
Tired of feelin' like I'm wrapped in a damn lie
Tired of feelin' like my life is a damn game
Nigga really wanna die in the night time
Tired of feelin' like I'm trapped in my damn mind
Tired of feelin' like I'm wrapped in a damn lie
Tired of feelin' like my life is a damn game
Nigga really wanna die in the night time
Tired of feelin' like I'm trapped in my damn mind
Tired of feelin' like I'm wrapped in a damn lie
Tired of feelin' like my life is a damn game
Nigga really wanna die in the night time
Nigga really wanna die in the night time
Nigga really wanna die in the night time
Nigga really wanna die in the night time, uh
Nigga really wanna die in the night time, uh
Nigga really wanna die in the night time


Don't go to sleep
Don't go, stay up with me
Don't go, don't go to sleep
Don't go, stay up and don't go to sleep
Ooh, ahh, ahh, ahh
Don't go, don't go to sleep
Don't go, stay up and don't

Choke me like you hate me, but you love me
Low-key wanna date me when you fuck me (Uwu)
Touch me with the lights off and my chains on
Baby, I'm not the right one you should wait on

She a freak, lil' bad ho
Gaspare told me kill it, I said, "Let me grab my Death Note"
Uh, she pulled me in like a lasso
Sayin' that she know me, I don't even know her at, though
Ain't no daddy issues, then I won't even bother
She say I kill her cat like I'm Luka Magnotta
Real bad bitch, pussy bald like Saitama
They used to hate me, now they want me, bitch, I feel like I'm Gaara
Uh, girl, you fuckin' with a wrong one
Fuck his team, fuck your clique, bitch, I'm on one
Fuck your stream, fuck your clip, you ain't saw one
Got your bitch on my dick like she want one


Look and she got Death Note, dead souls, split dye, chain cold
Think I fell in love when she said, "Grab me by the neck," though
All through the night, colder than ice
Man, I swear these goth girls finna fuck up my life
Bat wing fly like the moon in the sky
She just look into my soul with them Shinigami eyes
Coke in my nose and a blade on her thigh
Man, I think this girl is really tryna plan my demise
It's the pumpkin patch king with the corpse with the ring
And she'd fuck my best friend if I die here today


Choke me like you hate me, but you love me
Low-key wanna date me when you fuck me
Touch me with the lights off and my chains on
Baby, I'm not the right one you should wait on
---------------------------------------------------
The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go (mmmm)
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow (mmmm)
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now (mmmm)
Take my hand, stop, put Van The Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance
And now I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead (mmmm)

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body

Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date (mmmm)
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate (mmmm)
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay (mmmm)
And leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play
And I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead (mmmm)

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too

It's the most wonderful time of the year
With the kids jingle belling
And everyone telling you "be of good cheer"
It's the most wonderful time of the year

It's the hap-happiest season of all
With those holiday greetings
And gay happy meetings when friends come to call
It's the hap-happiest season of all

There'll be parties for hosting
Marshmallows for toasting
And caroling out in the snow
There'll be scary ghost stories
And tales of the glories
Of Christmases long, long ago

It's the most wonderful time of the year
There'll be much mistletoeing
And hearts will be glowing when loved ones are near
It's the most wonderful time of the year

There'll be parties for hosting

And hearts will be glowing when loved ones are near
It's the most wonderful time
Yes, the most wonderful time
Oh, the most wonderful time

Okay, I realize now, that everything that I did was wrong
Okay, I realize now, some things are better off said than done
Okay, I realize now, that maybe I'm not ready for love
Okay, I realize now, I finished us before we begun-un-un

I'm done, so done, I'm done with all the games you play
I'm numb, so numb, I'm numb to all the pain you bring
I'm tryna figure this all out for myself
I don't need you or nobody else, I'm done, so done
So done, so done, so done, so done, I'm done
(Oh no, no-no-no, no-no-no)

I think that it's time for you to realize
That I'm not gon' be here forever but I
Wish that I was, but you were the cause
For every lil' feelin' I'm feeling inside
Sometimes I sit and I think about why
I even trusted you, shit, unsurprised
I'm walkin' away from you, it's about time
Want you to walk out and walk out of my life
And you, yeah, you (Yeah, you)
You stay on my mind way more than I would like for you to
And you, yeah, you
The reason I can't find no love, don't wanna find no one

'Cause I'm done, so done, I'm done with all the games you play
I'm numb, so numb, I'm numb to all the pain you bring
I'm tryna figure this all out for myself
I don't need you or nobody else, I'm done, so done
So done, so done, so done, so done, I'm done

Wanna believe

That you don't have a bad bone in your body
But the bruises on your ego make you go wild, wild, wild, yeah
Wanna believe
Wanna believe
That even when you're stone cold
You're sorry
Tell me why you gotta be so out of your mind, yeah

I know you're chokin' on your fears
Already told you I'm right here
I will stay by your side
Every night

I don't know why you hide from the one
And close your eyes to the one
Mess up and lie to the one that you love
When you know you can cry to the one
Always confide in the one
You can be kind to the one that you love
I

I know you need, I know you need
The upper hand even when we aren't fighting
'Cause in the past, you had to prepare every time, yeah
Don't wanna leave, don't wanna leave
But if you're gonna fight then do it for me
I know you're built to love, but broken now, so just try
Yeah

I know you're chokin' on your fears
Already told you, I'm right here
I will stay by your side
Every night

I don't know why you hide from the one

Mess up and lie to the one that you love
When you know you can cry to the one
Always confide in the one
You can be kind to the one that you love

Going sick in the head, tryna get you there
And I know it's hard for you, but it's not fair
It's not fair

And close your eyes to the one
Mess up and lie to the one that you love

And I can't be without you
Why can't I find no one like you?
I can't sleep no more
In my head, we belong
And I can't be without you
Why can't I find no one like you?

Baby, we tried to fight it
We all been there some days
Thought I needed something else
And acted like I was okay
We just had to work it out
And baby, I needed space
Ain't nobody 'round here on your level
You're so far away
You're pouring your heart out
I'm acting like I knew
You held me so down
So down I never grew up
I tried to find out
When none of them came through
And now I'm stuck in the middle
And baby had to pull me out, oh

Like you, like you
Like you, ooh
I found it hard to find someone like you
Like you, like you
Send your location, come through (Yeah)

Damn papa, you a rare breed, no comparing

Let a ho know I ain't motherfuckin' sharing
I could take you to the parents, then to Paris
Plan a motherfuckin' wedding
You the type I wanna marry (Yeah) and keep you merry
I'll put the ring on when you ready
We play our fantasies out in real life ways and
No Final Fantasy, can we end these games though?
You give me energy, make me feel lightweight
Like the birds of a feather, baby
We real life made for each other
And it's hard to keep my cool
When other bitches tryna get with my dude and
When other chickens tryna get in my coop
'Cause you're a one in a million
There ain't no man like you

Like you, like you
Like you, ooh
I found it hard to find someone like you
Like you, like you
Send your location, come through

I can't sleep no more
In my head, we belong
And I can't be without you
Why can't I find no one like you?
I can't sleep no more

(Maniac)

You were with your friends, partyin'
When the alcohol kicked in
Said you wanted me dead so
You show up at my home all alone
With a shovel and a rose
Do you think I'm a joke? 'Cause

People like you always want back
What they can't have
But I'm past that
And you know that
So you should turn back
To your rat pack
Tell 'em I'm trash

Tell all of your friends that I'm crazy
And drive you mad
That I'm such a stalker, a watcher
A psychopath
Then tell them you hate me and dated
Me just for laughs
So why do you call me and tell me
You want me back?
You maniac

Call me crying in the dark
Now you're breaking my heart
So I show up at your place right away
Wipe the tears off of your face
While you beg me to stay, well

People like you always want back
What they can't have
But I'm past that
And you know that
So you should turn back
To your rat pack
Tell 'em I'm trash

Tell all of your friends that I'm crazy
And drive you mad
That I'm such a stalker, a watcher

Psychopathic, don't be so dramatic
We had magic, but you made it tragic
Now you're manic, honestly I've had it
Listen to yourself, think you need to get some help

Tell all of your friends that I'm crazy
And drive you mad
That I'm such a stalker, a watcher
A psychopath
Then tell them you hate me and dated
Me just for laughs
So why do you call me and tell me
You want me back?

Man, I feel just like a rockstar (star)
Ayy, ayy, all my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, man them the shottas
When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grrrata-ta-ta (pow, pow, pow)

Ayy, ayy, switch my whip, came back in black

Prolly leave my fuckin' show in a cop car

Threw a TV out the window of the Montage
Cocaine on the table, liquor pourin', don't give a damn
Dude, your girlfriend is a groupie, she just tryna get in
Sayin', "I'm with the band"

I've been in the Hills fuckin' superstars
Feelin' like a popstar (21, 21, 21)
Drankin' Henny, bad bitches jumpin' in the pool
And they ain't got on no bra (no bra)
Hit her from the back, pullin' on her tracks
And now she screamin' out, "No mas" (yeah, yeah, yeah)
They like, "Savage, why you got a 12 car garage
And you only got 6 cars?" (21)
I ain't with the cakin', how you kiss that? (kiss that?)
Your wifey say I'm lookin' like a whole snack (big snack)
Green hundreds in my safe, I got old racks (old racks)
L.A. bitches always askin' "Where the coke at?"
Livin' like a rockstar, smash out on a cop car
Sweeter than a Pop-Tart, you know you are not hard
I done made the hot chart, 'member I used to trap hard
Livin' like a rockstar, I'm livin' like a rockstar


Ayy, I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar (star)
Ayy, ayy, all my brothers got that gas

My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything
My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love

Talk to me, I need to hear you need me like I need ya
Fall for me, I wanna know you feel how I feel for you, love
Before you, baby, I was numb, drown the pain by pouring up
Speeding fast on the run, never want to get caught up
Now you the one that I'm calling
Swore that I'd never forget, don't think I'm just talking
I think I might go all in, no exceptions, girl, I need ya

Feeling like I'm out of my mind, cause I can't get enough
Only one that I give my time, 'cause I got eyes for ya
Might make an exception for ya, 'cause I been feeling ya
Think I might be out of my mind, I think that you're the one

My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything
My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything

I'll never give my all again
'Cause I'm sick of falling down
When I open up and give my trust
They find a way to break it down
Tear me up inside, and you break me down

Te ves tan rica, esa carita y ese tattoo
Ay, hace' que la nota nunca se baje
No hace falta nada si estas tu (Ra-Rauw), yeih

Yo no se ni que hacer (No se) cuando estoy cerca de ti (Wuh)
Tus ojos color cafe se apoderaron de mi (Yih-ih)
Muero por un beso de esos que no son de amigos, ey (De esos que no son de amigos)
Me di cuenta que por esa sonrisa yo vivo

(Camilo)
Yo quiero conocerte como nadie te conoce
Dime que me quieres pa' ponerlo en altavoces
Pa' mostrarte que yo soy tuyo
En las costillas me tatuo tu nombre, yeah-eh-eh

If you don't wanna see me

Did a full one-eighty, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now

Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word "goodbye"?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
(Don't, don't, don't)

Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now ('Bout me now, 'bout me)

Up, up
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Don't start now (Oh)
Up, up
Don't come out, out
I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

Don't show up (Don't show up), don't come out (Don't come out)
Don't start caring about me now ('Bout me now)
Walk away (Walk away), you know how (You know how)
Don't start caring about me now (So)

Up, up
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Walk away, walk away (So)
Up, up
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Walk away, walk away, oh

I fell by the wayside like everyone else
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you
But I was just kidding myself
Our every moment, I start to replace
'Cause now that they're gone
All I hear are the words that I needed to say

When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal but this won't

So, before you go
Was there something I could've said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go

Was never the right time whenever you called
Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all
Our every moment, I start to replay
But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face

When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal but this won't

So, before you go
Was there something I could've said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go

Would we be better off by now
If I'd have let my walls come down
Maybe I guess we'll never know
You know
You know

Before you go
Was there something I could've said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowin' and blowin' up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air

What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh

Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jinglin' feet
That's the jingle bell rock

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bell chime in jingle bell time
Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air

What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh

Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jinglin' feet
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell rock

Desde el principio fuiste tu la que impuso
Que lo dejaramos asi
El alma y la mente en un duelo
Forcejando pa' quedarte aqui
Haciendolo esta muy adelanta' la nena
Seca con los demas y conmigo en humedad

Bien maquillada, asi sera
Tu piel mojada, tan despeinada
Sin decir nada, asi se va

Asi sera
No hemos empezao' y odio cuando tu te vas
Solo hemos hablao' y te siento muy humeda

Una mujer como tu yo quiero
Quedate que yo te necesito

Ay, si tu te vas guardame un laito'
Que me voy detras
Vamonos de aqui, pa' no volver jamas
Porque yo me muero cuando tu no estas
Siento que sobra el aire
Y estoy acostumbrado a que me falte contigo
Como tu no hay nadie
Se que tu quieres estar conmigo, eso es asi
Una mujer como tu yo quiero
Quedate que yo te necesito
Pueden regalarme el mundo entero

Ay pero por algo sera
Que no cambio lo de conocerte
Cambio que te vayas cuando amanece

Bitch, I'm a thot, get me lit
I can't fuck with these niggas 'cause niggas is gay
All on my page suckin' dick
All in my comments and screamin' my name
While I'm in the club, throwin' them hundreds and fifties and ones and ones
Pop Smoke, they know I'm wildin'
If I'm on the island, I'm snatchin' the cell
Brody got locked, denied his bail
Until he free, I'm raisin' hell
Tell my shooters call me FaceTime
For all the times we had to face time
Free D-Nice, he doin' state time
If you need the glizzy, you could take mine
Please don't come out your mouth, you know I'm like that
I'll make a movie like TNT
Glock-30 on me, ask who really want it
I bet I air it like BNB
Nappy Blue wildin' in my section
And I keep that .38 for the weapon
Remember when I came home from corrections
All the bad bitches in my direction

She like the way that I dance

Don't you know I'm no good for you?
I've learned to lose you can't afford to
Tore my shirt to stop you bleeding
But nothing ever stops you leaving

Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

Don't you know too much already?
I'll only hurt you if you let me
Call me friend, but keep me closer
(Call me back)
And I'll call you when the party's over

Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
Yeah, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

But nothing is better, sometimes
Once we've both said our goodbyes
Let's just let it go
Let me let you go

Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

Le gusta salir y amanecer
Beber y enloquecerse
Y cuando el dia termine
No se si la vuelvo a ver

Y yo que no traje bloqueador
Pa' tanto calor que quema
Y ese cuerpito que tu tiene
El traje 'e bano chiquitito te queda

Esa blanquita con el sol
Y de una ya se pone morena
Un trago en mano, bien borracha
Todos saben que su vida es extrema
Dice que no, pero se que mi flow le corre por las venas

Y ese cuerpito que tu tiene
El traje 'e bano chiquitito te queda

Esa blanquita con el sol
Y de una ya se pone morena
Un trago en mano, bien borracha
Todos saben que su vida es extrema
Dice que no, pero se que mi flow le corre por las venas

Leggo

Mami, sacudete la arena
Con ese booty me duele que seas ajena, yeah
Se puso una de mis cadenas
Nunca le baja, siempre con la copa llena

Ella entro, saludo y en el bote se monto
Dos cachas y tosio cuando Sky se lo paso
Me pegue, lo meneo, nunca me dijo que no
Se lucio, abuso y eso que ni se esforzo

Y yo que no traje bloqueador
Pa' tanto calor que quema
Y ese cuerpito que tu tiene
El traje 'e bano chiquitito te queda

Esa blanquita con el sol
Y de una ya se pone morena
Un trago en mano, bien borracha
Todos saben que su vida es extrema
Dice que no, pero se que mi flow le corre por las venas

Con tu cuerpo sube la marea
En traje 'e bano bobo me deja
A lo Yankee, estas dura
Como Maluma, pa' que suba la temperatura
Hace calor, hace calor
Por tu cuerpo baja tu sudor
Toma agua ardiente y lo pasa con ron
Si no es bikini, ropa interior
Cuando la vi yo le dije  como fue?
Abajo 'el yate fue que la pille
Esta loca y de todo prueba

Y ese cuerpito que tu tiene
El traje 'e bano chiquitito te queda

Esa blanquita con el sol
Y de una ya se pone morena
Un trago en mano, bien borracha
Todos saben que su vida es extrema
Dice que no, pero se que mi flow le corre por las venas

Y ese cuerpito que tu tiene
El traje 'e bano chiquitito te queda

Esa blanquita con el sol
Y de una ya se pone morena
Un trago en mano, bien borracha
Todos saben que su vida es extrema
Dice que no, pero se que mi flow le corre por las venas

What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawin' me in and you kickin' me out
You've got my head spinnin', no kiddin'
I can't pin you down
What's goin' on in that beautiful mind?
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me
But I'll be alright

My head's under water, but I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginnin'
Even when I lose, I'm winnin'

'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh

How many times do I have to tell you?
Even when you're crying, you're beautiful too
The world is beating you down, I'm around
Through every mood
You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing
In my head for you

My head's under water, but I'm breathin' fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginnin'
Even when I lose, I'm winnin'

'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh

Give me all of you, oh
Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts
Risking it all, though it's hard

'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginnin'
Even when I lose, I'm winnin'

'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you

I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh

Ey, ey
Los pongo a bailar La Pelua'
Y el que no baile que los despeluquen (Ey)
Hijueputa no me cuquen
Lean los numero' pa' que se eduquen
Yo no hago canciones, hago himnos pa' que no caduquen (Ey)
En este genero yo fui un Hadoken (Ey, ey)

Y se extinguieron como lo dinosaur (Prr)
Antes que me apague se apaga el sol
Subimos y rompimos el ascensor
El spray que les tiro Bulbasaur
Maldito conejo
Ahora los miro de arriba y de lejo' (Ey)
No contesto DM (No)
Hablen con mi manejo, pero
El tambien va pichar
Te juro que yo me quise enbichar, ey
Le meti a to' mis crush, shh
Ya me aburre hasta chichar

Y yo si soy Milli sin usar Richard
Yankee se retira y vamos a switchar
Voy a ser el jefe, me van fichar
Mi nombre por siempre se va escuchar

Porque estoy en mi peak (Ey)
Estoy en mi peak (Estoy en mi peak, ey)
Soy un rey campeon Booker T (Wo-wo-wo)
Ey, ey, estoy en mi peak (Estoy en mi peak)
Estoy en mi peak
Mirame en lo que me converti

Les molesta mi premio de compositor
Pero es que ya nadie compone
Ninguna 'e esta gente escriben sus canciones
So, no se emocionen

El disco mas vendido de este puto ano
Los lleve pa' la escuela
To' el mundo tratando de hacerle secuela
Sigan en la fila, nadie se me cuela, ey

Cheki, morena, cheki
Cheki, morena, eh
Bad Bunny se llevo to' los premio'
Y el cabron ni fue

Ustedes pagando pa' irse virales
Yo pegando tema sin hacerle promo
La gente se pregunta como
Desde chamaquito sabes como somo'
Nunca pido tenqui

Yo soy coco, ustedes baking
Booker T tirandome un breaking
Estoy en mi peak, cabron
Y voy a seguir en mi peak, cabron, ey

Soy un rey, campeon, Booker T, ey
Estoy en mi peak, ey
Y voy a seguir en mi peak, ey, ey
Mirame,  que tu que?  que tu que?, na-na
Cabron, tu eres feka
(Can you dig it, sucka?)

Ey, ey, ey
Ni voy a frontear
Dale repeat cabron, pa' que vea que estoy bien hijueputa
---------------------------------------------------
La-la, la-la, la

Yeah, it's been a long night and the mirror's telling me to go home (Home)
But it's been a long time since I felt this good on my own
Lotta years went by with my hands tied up in your ropes
Forever, and ever, no more (No more)

The midnight sky's, the road I'm taking
Head high up in the clouds (Oh-whoa)

I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh, no
I don't need to be loved by you (By you)
Fire in my lungs, can't bite the devil on my tongue, oh, no
I don't need to be loved by you
See my lips, on her mouth, everybody's talking now, baby
Ooh, you know it's true, yeah
That I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh, no
I don't need to be loved by you (Loved by you)

La-la, la-la, la

She got her hair pulled back 'cause the sweat's dripping off of her face (Her face)
Said it ain't so bad if I wanna make a couple mistakes
You should know right now that I never stay put in one place
Forever and ever, no more (No more)

The midnight sky's, the road I'm taking
Head high up in the clouds (Oh-whoa)

I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh, no
I don't need to be loved by you (By you)
Fire in my lungs, can't bite the devil on my tongue, oh, no
I don't need to be loved by you
See my lips, on her mouth, everybody's talking now, baby
Ooh, you know it's true, yeah
That I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh, no
I don't need to be loved by you (By you)

Oh

I don't hide, blurry eyes like you
Like you

I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh, no
I don't need to be loved by you (By you)
Fire in my lungs, can't bite the devil on my tongue, you know
I don't need to be loved by you
See his hands 'round my waist, thought you never be replaced, baby
Ooh, you know it's true, yeah
That I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh, no
I don't need to be loved by you
Yea

La-la, la-la, la
La-la

You know it's true
You know it's true
(Loved by you)

If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time

You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
You, moonlight, you're my starlight (You're the moonlight)
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating

I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy
I see us written in the stars
We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never
Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far
Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
Shining just the way we are
I feel like we're forever every time we get together
But whatever, let's get lost on Mars

You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
You, moonlight, you're my starlight (You're the moonlight)
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating

You can fly away with me tonight
You can fly away with me tonight
Baby, let me take you for a ride
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm levitating (Woo)
You can fly away with me tonight
You can fly away with me tonight
Baby, let me take you for a ride
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Woo)

My love is like a rocket, watch it blast off
And I'm feeling so electric, dance my ass off
And even if I wanted to, I can't stop
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
My love is like a rocket, watch it blast off
And I'm feeling so electric, dance my ass off
And even if I wanted to, I can't stop
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading

I got you (Yeah), moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night (All night), come on, dance with me
I'm levitating (Woo)

You can fly away with me tonight (Tonight)

You, moonlight, you're my starlight (You're the moonlight)
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
---------------------------------------------------
If all of the kings had their queens on the throne
We would pop champagne and raise a toast
To all of the queens who are fighting alone
Baby, you're not dancin' on your own

Can't live without me, you wanna' but you can't, nah-nah-nah
Think it's funny, but honey, can't run this show on your own
I can feel my body shake, there's only so much I can take
I'll show you how a real queen behaves, oh

No damsel in distress, don't need to save me
Once I start breathin' fire, you can't tame me
And you might think I'm weak without a sword
But if I had one, it'd be bigger than yours

If all of the kings had their queens on the throne
We would pop champagne and raise a toast
To all of the queens who are fighting alone
Baby, you're not dancin' on your own

Disobey me, then baby, it's off with your head
Gonna' change it and make it a world you won't forget
No damsel in distress, don't need to save me
Once I start breathin' fire, you can't tame me
And you might think I'm weak without a sword
But I'm stronger than I ever was before

If all of the kings had their queens on the throne
We would pop champagne and raise a toast
To all of the queens who are fighting alone
Baby, you're not dancin' on your own

In chess, the king can move one space at a time
But queens are free to go wherever they like
You get too close, you'll get a royalty high
So breathe it in to feel alive

If all of the kings had their queens on the throne
We would pop champagne and raise a toast
To all of the queens who are fighting alone
Baby, you're not dancin' on your own
---------------------------------------------------
Someone said they left together
I ran out the door to get her
She was holding hands with Trevor
Not the greatest feeling ever
Said, "Pull yourself together
You should try your luck with Heather"
Then I heard they slept together
Oh, the less I know the better
The less I know the better

Oh my love, can't you see yourself by my side
No surprise when you're on his shoulder like every night
Oh my love, can't you see that you're on my mind
Don't suppose you could convince your lover to change his mind
So goodbye

She said, "It's not now or never
Wait 10 years, we'll be together"
I said, "Better late than never
Just don't make me wait forever"
Don't make me wait forever
Don't make me wait forever

Oh my love, can't you see yourself by my side?
I don't suppose you could convince your lover to change his mind

I was doing fine without ya
'Til I saw your face, now I can't erase
Giving in to all his bullshit
Is this what you want, is this who you are?
I was doing fine without ya
'Til I saw your eyes turn away from mine
Oh, sweet darling, where he wants you
Said, "Come on Superman, say your stupid line"
Said, "Come on Superman, say your stupid line"
Said, "Come on Superman, say your stupid line"
---------------------------------------------------
Candy, she's sweet like candy in my veins
Baby, I'm dying for another taste

And every night my mind is running around her
Thunder's getting louder and louder

Baby, you're like lightning in a bottle
I can't let you go now that I got it
And all I need is to be struck
By your electric love
Baby, your electric love
Electric love

Drown me
You make my heart beat like the rain
Surround me
Hold me deep beneath your waves

And every night my mind is running around her
Thunder's getting louder and louder and louder

Baby, you're like lightning in a bottle
I can't let you go now that I got it
And all I need is to be struck
By your electric love
Baby, your electric love
Electric love

Rushing through me
Feel your energy rushing through me
Feel your energy rushing through me

Baby, you're like lightning in a bottle
I can't let you go now that I got it
And all I need is to be struck by your electric love
Baby, your electric love
Baby, you're electric
---------------------------------------------------
Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift
The type that sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found that makes me think of you somehow and I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep
Spilling drinks on my settee

(Do I wanna know?)
If this feeling flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go)
Was sort of hoping that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know)
That the nights were mainly made for saying things that you can't say tomorrow day

Crawling back to you

Ever thought of calling when you've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
Now I've thought it through

Crawling back to you

So have you got the guts?
Been wondering if your heart's still open and if so I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down and pucker up
I'm sorry to interrupt. It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of trying to kiss you
I don't know if you feel the same as I do
But we could be together if you wanted to

(Do I wanna know?)
If this feeling flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go)
Was sort of hoping that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know)
That the nights were mainly made for saying things that you can't say tomorrow day

Crawling back to you (crawling back to you)

Ever thought of calling when you've had a few? (you've had a few)
'Cause I always do ('cause I always do)
Maybe I'm too (maybe I'm too busy) busy being yours to fall for somebody new
Now I've thought it through

Crawling back to you

(Do I wanna know?)
If this feeling flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go)
Was sort of hoping that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know)
That the nights were mainly made for saying things that you can't say tomorrow day

(Do I wanna know?)
Too busy being yours to fall
(Sad to see you go)
Ever thought of calling darling?
(Do I wanna know?)
Do you want me crawling back to you?
---------------------------------------------------
I've always been the one to say the first goodbye
Had to love and lose a hundred million times
Had to get it wrong to know just what I like
Now I'm falling

You say my name like I have never heard before
I'm indecisive, but this time I know for sure
I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all
Are you falling?

Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I woulda known it, baby

I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

Oh no, I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

I wonder, when you go, if I stay on your mind
Two can play that game, but you win me every time
Everyone before you was a waste of time
Yeah, you got me

Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I woulda known it, baby

I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

Oh no, I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

Ooh, break my heart
Ooh, break my heart
Ooh
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home (I would've stayed at home 'cause I)
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

Oh no (Oh no), I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
---------------------------------------------------
If you don't wanna see me

Did a full one-eighty, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now

Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word "goodbye"?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
(Don't, don't, don't)

Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now ('Bout me now, 'bout me)

Up, up
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Don't start now (Oh)
Up, up
Don't come out, out
I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

Don't show up (Don't show up), don't come out (Don't come out)
Don't start caring about me now ('Bout me now)
Walk away (Walk away), you know how (You know how)
Don't start caring about me now (So)

Up, up
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Walk away, walk away (So)
Up, up
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Walk away, walk away, oh
---------------------------------------------------
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
Take a look at the five and ten
It's glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow.

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door.

A pair of hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben;
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen;
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again.

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well,
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow.

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas;
Soon the bells will start,
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door.

Sure it's Christmas once more...
---------------------------------------------------
Why you always in a mood?
Fuckin 'round, actin' brand new
I ain't tryna tell you what to do
But try to play it cool
Baby, I ain't playing by your rules
Everything look better with a view
Why you always in a mood?
Fuckin 'round, actin' brand new
I ain't tryna tell you what to do
But try to play it cool
Baby, I ain't playing by your rules
Everything look better with a view


I could never get attached
When I start to feel, I unattach
Somehow I always end up feeling bad
Baby, I am not your dad, it's not all you want from me
I just want your company
Girl, it's obvious, elephant in the room
And we're a part of it, don't act so confused
And you love startin' it, now I'm in a mood
Now we're arguin' in my bedroom

We play games of love to avoid the depression
We've been here before
And I won't be your victim


Why you always in a mood?
Fuckin 'round, actin' brand new
I ain't tryna tell you what to do
But try to play it cool
Baby, I ain't playing by your rules
Everything look better with a view
Why you always in a mood?
Fuckin 'round, actin' brand new
I ain't tryna tell you what to do
But try to play it cool
Baby, I ain't playing by your rules
Everything look better with a view

So why you tryin' to fake your love on the regular
When you could be blowin' up just like my cellular
I won't ever let a shorty go and set me up
Only thing I need to know is if you wet enough
I'm talking slick back, kick back, gang sippin' forties
You keep playing, not another day with you shorty
Mismatched fits, that was way before you know me
Got a lot of love, well you better save it for me


We play games of love to avoid the depression
We've been here before
And I won't be your victim


Why you always in a mood?
Fuckin 'round, actin' brand new
I ain't tryna tell you what to do
But try to play it cool
Baby, I ain't playing by your rules
Everything look better with a view
Why you always in a mood?
Fuckin 'round, actin' brand new
I ain't tryna tell you what to do
But try to play it cool
Baby, I ain't playing by your rules
Everything look better with a view

Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck (wreck)
Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck (wreck)

Needless to say, I'm keepin' in check
She was a bad-bad, nevertheless
Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck
Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck

Thinkin' in a bad way, losin' your grip
Screamin' at my face, baby, don't trip
Someone took a big L, don't know how that felt
Lookin' at you sideways, party on tilt

Ooh-ooh
Some things you just can't refuse
She wanna ride me like a cruise
And I'm not tryna lose

Then you're left in the dust
Unless I stuck by ya
You're a sunflower
I think your love would be too much
Or you'll be left in the dust
Unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower
You're the sunflower


Every time I'm leavin' on you
You don't make it easy, no, no
Wish I could be there for you
Give me a reason to, oh, oh

Every time I'm walkin' out
I can hear you tellin' me to turn around
Fightin' for my trust and you won't back down
Even if we gotta risk it all right now, oh

I know you're scared of the unknown (-known)
You don't wanna be alone (alone)
I know I always come and go (and go)
But it's out of my control

And you'll be left in the dust
Unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower
I think your love would be too much
Or you'll be left in the dust
Unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower
You're the sunflower
Yeah

Are things better or worse the second time around?
Can we really do anything more than once?
---------------------------------------------------
Yeah
Rest in peace to all the kids that lost their lives in the Parkland shooting. This song is dedicated to you

OK, she keep crying, she keep crying every single night
Day and night, on my mind, please don't kill the vibe
Oh no, I swear to God, I be in my mind
Swear I wanna die, yeah, when you cross my 

Said I wanna die, yuh, no, I'm not alright, yuh
I might start a riot, yuh, I'm so fuckin' tired, yuh
So what's up? What you say? Feelin' good, I'm feelin' great
Tired of the fuckin' hate, stackin' cheese all on my plate

So outside my misery, I think I'll find
A way of envisioning a better life
For the rest of us, the rest of us
There's hope for the rest of us, the rest of us

OK, she keep crying, she keep crying every single night
Day and night, on my mind, please don't kill the vibe
Oh no, I swear to God, I be in my mind
Swear I wanna die, yeah, when you cross my 

Said I wanna die, yuh, no, I'm not alright, yuh
I might start a riot, yuh, I'm so fuckin' tired, yuh
So what's up? What you say? Feelin' good, I'm feelin' great
Tired of the fuckin' hate, stackin' cheese all on my plate

---------------------------------------------------
This night is cold in the kingdom
I can feel you fade away
From the kitchen to the bathroom sink and
Your steps keep me awake

Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
I once was a man with dignity and grace
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
So please, please

Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me

If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly

Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down
Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down

If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly

Cold skin, drag my feet on the tile
As I'm walking down the corridor
And I know we haven't talked in a while
So I'm looking for an open door

Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
I once was a man with dignity and grace
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
So please, please

Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me

If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly

Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down
Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down

If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly

And I can't stop myself from falling down
And I can't stop myself from falling down
And I can't stop myself from falling down
And I can't stop myself from falling down

Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me

If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly

Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down
Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down

If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly

If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly

Nobody's gonna get me on another rap
So, look at me now, I'm just making my play
Don't try to push your luck, just get out of my way

"What's wrong?" you've been asking
But I don't have an answer
How come, I'm still thinking
Let's pretend to fall asleep now
When we get old will we regret this?
Too young to think about all that shit
And stalling only goes so far
When you've got a head start

'Cause we could stay at home and watch the sunset
But I can't help from asking are you bored yet?
And if you're feeling lonely you should tell me
Before this ends up as another memory
Will you tell the truth so I don't have to lie
Will you tell the truth so I don't have to lie

Feels like I've known you my whole life
I can see right through your lies
I don't know where we're going
But I'd like to be by your side
If you could tell me how you're feeling
Maybe we'd get through this undefeated
Holding on for so long, oh

'Cause we could stay at home and watch the sunset
But I can't help from asking are you bored yet?
And if you're feeling lonely you should tell me
Before this ends up as another memory
Will you tell the truth so I don't have to lie (lie)
Will you tell the truth so I don't have to lie

I've been holding my breath
I've been counting to ten
Over something you said
I've been holding back tears
While you're throwing back beers
I'm alone in bed

You know I, I'm afraid of change
Guess that's why we stay the same

So tell me to leave
I'll pack my bags, get on the road
Find someone that loves you
Better than I do, darling I know
'Cause you remind me every day
I'm not enough but I still stay

Feels like a lifetime
Just tryna get by
While we're dying inside
I've done a lot of things wrong
Loving you being one
But I can't move on

You know I, I'm afraid of change
Guess that's why we stay the same

So tell me to leave
I'll pack my bags, get on the road
Find someone that loves you
Better than I do, darling I know
'Cause you remind me every day
I'm not enough but I still stay

If you want me to leave
Then tell me to leave, and baby I'll go

You remind me every day
I'm not enough but I still stay
---------------------------------------------------
I didn't ask for a free ride
I only asked you to show me a real good time
I never asked for the rainfall
At least I showed up, you showed me nothing at all

It's coming down on me
Water like misery
It's coming down on me
I'm ready, rain on me

I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me


Rain on me
Mmm, oh yeah, baby
Rain on me


Livin' in a world where no one's innocent
Oh, but at least we try, mmm
Gotta live my truth, not keep it bottled in
So I don't lose my mind, baby, yeah


I can feel it on my skin (It's comin' down on me)
Teardrops on my face (Water like misery)
Let it wash away my sins (It's coming down on me)
Let it wash away, yeah

I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain (Rain) on (On) me

Eh, eh, yeah
Rain on me
---------------------------------------------------
You call me on the telephone, you feel so far away
You tell me to come over, there's some games you wanna play
I'm walking to your house, nobody's home
Just me and you and you and me alone

We're just playing hide and seek
It's getting hard to breathe under the sheets with you
I don't want to play no games
I'm tired of always chasing, chasing after you

I don't give a fuck about you anyways
Whoever said I gave a shit 'bout you?
You never share your toys or communicate
I guess I'm just a play date to you

Wake up in your bedroom and there's nothing left to say
When I try to talk you're always playing board games
I wish I had monopoly over your mind
I wish I didn't care all the time

We're just playing hide and seek
It's getting hard to breathe under the sheets with you
I don't wanna play no games
I'm tired of always chasing, chasing after you

I don't give a fuck about you anyways
Whoever said I gave a shit 'bout you?
You never share your toys or communicate
I guess I'm just a play date to you

Ring around the rosy
I never know, I never know what you need
Ring around the rosy, I wanna give you, wanna give you
What you need

I don't give a fuck about you anyways
Whoever said I gave a shit 'bout you?
You never share your toys or communicate
I guess I'm just a play date to you

You know I give a fuck about you everyday
Guess it's time that I tell you the truth
If I share my toys, will you let me stay?
Don't wanna leave this play date with you
---------------------------------------------------
Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start

They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me


So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost

I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
Hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans

Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game made for everyone
And love is the prize


So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost

Didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know (didn't know, didn't know)
---------------------------------------------------
It's the most beautiful time of the year
Lights fill the streets spreading so much cheer
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I'mma be under the mistletoe

I don't wanna miss out on the holiday
But I can't stop staring at your face
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I'mma be under the mistletoe

With you, shawty with you

Everyone's gathering around the fire
Chestnuts roasting like a hot July

Reindeer's flying through the sky so high

But I'mma be under the mistletoe

With you under the mistletoe

With you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you

The way I followed my heart
And it led me to a miracle

Ayy, love, don't you buy me nothing
'Cause I am feeling one thing: your lips on my lips
That's a merry, merry Christmas

It's the most beautiful time of the year
Lights fill the streets spreading so much cheer
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I'mma be under the mistletoe

But I can't stop staring at your face
I should be playing in the winter snow

Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

Man, it doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've brought me some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow

When we finally kiss good-night
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

And the fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow and snow

When we finally kiss good-night
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really grab me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

Oh, the fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

Play me something to bop while I ride with the pole
Here you go (Uh, oh, hah, okay)

I needed some shit with some bop in it (Let's go)
I flew past the whip with that blunt in my mouth
Watch the swervin', that whip had a cop in it (Woo)
My bitch got good pussy, fly her 'cross the country

I'm still with the shits, I'm a hot nigga (I'm hot)

The ones that go to work by day, then, you know
Dance in the mirror by night (Hah)

---------------------------------------------------
Feeling good, like I should
Went and took a walk around the neighborhood
Feeling blessed, never stressed
Got that sunshine on my Sunday best

Everyday can be a better day despite the challenge
All you gotta do is leave it better than you found it
It's gonna get difficult to stand but hold your balance
I just say whatever cause there is no way around it cause

Everyone falls down sometimes
But you just gotta know it'll all be fine
It's okay, uh-huh
It's okay, it's okay

Feeling good, like I should
Went and took a walk around the neighborhood
Feeling blessed, never stressed
Got that sunshine on my Sunday best

Somedays you wake up and nothing works you feel surrounded
Gotta give your feet some gravity to get you grounded
Keep good things inside your ears just like the waves and sound did
And just say whatever cause there is no way around it

Everyone falls down sometimes
But you just gotta know it'll all be fine
It's okay, uh-huh
It's okay, it's okay

Feeling good, like I should
Went and took a walk around the neighborhood
Feeling blessed, never stressed
Got that sunshine on my Sunday best

Feeling good, like I should
Went and took a walk around the neighborhood
Feeling blessed, never stressed
Got that sunshine on my Sunday best

Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier
I want you to be happier

When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day, we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that the story ends

Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier
I want you to be happier

When the evening falls
And I'm left there with my thoughts
And the image of you being with someone else
Well, it's eating me up inside

But we ran our course, we pretended we're OK
Now if we jump together at least we can swing
Far away from the wreck we made

Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier
I want you to be happier

So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go

Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier
I want you to be happier
Even though I might not like this
I think that you'll be happier
I want you to be happier

Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier
I want you to be happier

So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go
---------------------------------------------------
Tell me somethin', girl
Are you happy in this modern world?
Or do you need more?
Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?

I'm falling
In all the good times I find myself longin' for change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself


Tell me something, boy
Aren't you tired tryna fill that void?
Or do you need more?
Ain't it hard keeping it so hardcore?

I'm falling
In all the good times I find myself longin' for change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself

I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now


In the sha-ha-sha-ha-low
In the sha-ha-sha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-ha-sha-ha-ha-low
We're far from the shallow now


Oh, ha, ah, ha
Oh-ah, ha
Oh, ha, ah, ha

I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now


In the sha-ha-sha-ha-low
In the sha-ha-sha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-ha-sha-ha-ha-low
We're far from the shallow now
---------------------------------------------------
I took your heart
I did things to you only lovers would do in the dark
It made you a god
Priests, popes, and preachers would tell me I did it wrong
But, hey
You made a negro flip
Now, what do I say
To make me exist? Oh
Stranger...

Still don't know my name
You still don't know my name
And I would die your slave, I'd tell you right now
But you still don't know my name, yeah

Wish you, wish you'd come over, mmh
Miss you, kiss you in make-believe
I'm dreaming of all of the possibilities
I'm kissing all over your body, my Nefertiti
And every time I think the planets aligning
You're still so close, but yet so far

Still don't know my name
You still don't know my name
And I would die your slave, I'd tell you right now
But you still don't know my name, yeah
---------------------------------------------------
Thought I'd end up with Sean
But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about Ricky
Now I listen and laugh
Even almost got married
And for Pete, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, "Thank you" to Malcolm
'Cause he was an angel

One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
Say I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
So, look what I got
Look what you taught me
And for that, I say

Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
I'm so fuckin'...

Spend more time with my friends
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Plus, I met someone else
We havin' better discussions
I know they say I move on too fast
But this one gon' last
'Cause her name is Ari
And I'm so good with that (So good with that)

She taught me love (Love)
She taught me patience (Patience)
How she handles pain (Pain)
That shit's amazing (Yeah, she's amazing)
I've loved and I've lost (Yeah, yeah)
But that's not what I see (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause look what I've found (Yeah, yeah, I've found)
Ain't no need for searching, and for that, I say

Thank you, next (Thank you, next)
Thank you, next (Thank you, next)
Thank you, next (Thank you)
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex
Thank you, next (Thank you, next)
Thank you, next (Said thank you, next)
Thank you, next (Next)
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex

Thank you, next
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
I'm so fucking...

One day I'll walk down the aisle
Holding hands with my mama
I'll be thanking my dad
'Cause she grew from the drama
Only wanna do it once, real bad
Gon' make that shit last
God forbid something happens
Least this song is a smash (Song is a smash)

I've got so much love (Love)
Got so much patience (Patience)
And I've learned from the pain (Pain)
I turned out amazing (Turned out amazing)
Say I've loved and I've lost (Yeah, yeah)
But that's not what I see (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause look what I've found (Yeah, yeah)
Ain't no need for searching
And for that, I say

Thank you, next (Thank you, next)
Thank you, next (Thank you, next)
Thank you, next
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex
Thank you, next (Thank you, next)
Thank you, next (Said thank you, next)

I love it when you call me Senorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true la-la-la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming
For ya

Land in Miami
The air was hot from summer rain
Sweat dripping off me
Before I even knew her name la-la-la
It felt like ooh-la-la-la
Yeah, no

Sapphire moonlight
We danced for hours in the sand
Tequila Sunrise
Her body fit right in my hands, la-la-la
It felt like ooh-la-la-la
Yeah

I love it when you call me Senorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true la-la-la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you know I love it

When you call me Senorita
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true la-la-la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming
For ya

Locked in the hotel
There's just some things that never change
You say, "We're just friends."
But friends don't know the way you taste-la-la-la
'Cause you know it's been a long time comin'
Don't you let me fall, oh

Ooh, when your lips undress me
Hooked on your tongue
Ooh, love, your kiss is deadly
Don't stop

I love it when you call me Senorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true la-la-la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you know I love it

When you call me Senorita
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true la-la-la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming
For ya

All along I'll be coming for ya (for ya)
And I hope it meant something to ya
Call my name, I'll be comin' for ya (comin' for ya)
Comin' for ya (comin' for ya)

For ya, for ya (oh, she loves it when I call her), for ya
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming
For ya
---------------------------------------------------
Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much and that's an issue
But I'm OK
Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them
Again

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no calls
Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar
And I, I, I, I, I can't stop
No, I, I, I, I, I can't stop

So, baby, pull me closer
In the back seat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of that mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

You look as good as the day I met you
I forget just why I left you,
I was insane
Stay and play that Blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson
OK

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no call
Now I'm looking pretty in a hotel bar
And I, I, I, I, I can't stop
No, I, I, I, I, I can't stop

So, baby, pull me closer
In the back seat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of that mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

So, baby, pull me closer
In the back seat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of that mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
No, we ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
No, we ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
No, we ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
No, we ain't ever getting older
---------------------------------------------------
First things first rest in peace Uncle Phil
For real, you the only father that I ever knew
I get my bitch pregnant I'mma be a better you
Prophecies that I made way back in the Ville
Fulfilled. Listen: even back when we was broke my team ill
Martin Luther King would have been on Dreamville
Talk to a nigga

One time for my LA sisters
One time for my LA hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who knows

Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved

No role models and I'm here right now
No role models to speak of
Searchin' through my memory, my memory
I couldn't find one
Last night I was gettin' my feet rubbed
By the baddest bitch, not Trina, but I swear to God
This bitch will make you call your girl up and tell her "Hey, what's good?"
"Sorry I'm never comin' home I'mma stay for good"
Then hang the phone up, and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame 'bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said "Nah, I was the same without it"
But then I thought back, back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
Before I started callin' bitches "bitches" so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody
You wasn't sweatin' me

One time for my LA sisters
One time for my LA hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who knows

Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved

I want a real love, dark-skinned and Aunt Viv love
That Jada and that Will love
That leave a toothbrush at your crib love
And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love
Nigga I don't want no bitch from reality shows
Out-of-touch-with-reality hoes
Out in Hollywood bringin' back 5 or 6 hoes
Fuck 'em then we kick 'em to the door
Nigga you know how it go
She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap
You think if I didn't rap she would flirt back
Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt before she leave
"I'mma need my shirt back"
Nigga you know how it go

One time for my LA sisters
One time for my LA hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who knows

Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved

There's an old saying in Tennessee - I know it's in Texas - probably in Tennessee that says fool me once, shame on - shame on you.
If you fool me we can't get fooled again

Fool me one time shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace signs
Load the chopper, let it rain on you
(Bop, bop, bop)

Fool me one time shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace signs
Load the chopper, let it rain on you
(Bop, bop, bop)

My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet
My only regret was too young for Nia Long
Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows
Hand her a script the bitch probably couldn't read along
My only regret was too young for Sade Adu
My only regret could never take Aaliyah home
Now all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone
With the stale face 'cause they know it's they song
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)

Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved

Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
---------------------------------------------------
I fell by the wayside like everyone else
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you
But I was just kidding myself
Our every moment, I start to replace
'Cause now that they're gone
All I hear are the words that I needed to say

When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal but this won't

So, before you go
Was there something I could've said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go

Was never the right time whenever you called
Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all
Our every moment, I start to replay
But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face

When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal but this won't

So, before you go
Was there something I could've said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go

Would we be better off by now
If I'd have let my walls come down
Maybe I guess we'll never know
You know
You know

Before you go
Was there something I could've said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go
