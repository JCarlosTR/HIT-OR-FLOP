I said, "I love you" first
Standing in your kitchen wearing nothing but your favorite shirt
And that's what makes this hurt
'Cause right now you're only remember-remembering the worst

And I hate this, yeah, I hate it
That we're ending so ugly, didn't have to be this way
And I hate that, that you hate me
That we're ending so ugly, didn't have to be this way

You, you, you can call me the bad guy

Tell me something girl
Are you happy in this modern world
Or do you need more
Is there somethin' else you're searching for

But I'm fallin'
In all the good times I find myself
Longing for change
And in the bad times I fear myself
Yeah, eh, eh

Tell me somethin' boy
Aren't you tired tryna fill that void
Or do you need more
Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore

I'm fallin'
In all the good times I find myself
Longing for change
And in the bad times I fear myself

I'm off the deep end
Watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface
Where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now

In the shallow
In the shallow
In the shallow
We're far from the shallow now

I'm off the deep end
Watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface

---------------------------------------------------
Breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things

Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who would have thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with cuffs and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing

My wrist, stop watchin'
My neck is flossin'
Make big deposits
My gloss is poppin'

You like my hair?
Gee, thanks! Just bought it
I see it, I like it
I want it, I got it
Yeah

I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it

You like my hair?
Gee, thanks! Just bought it
I see it, I like it
I want it, I got it
Yeah

Wearin' a ring but ain't gon' be no "Mrs."
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction

Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, "Which one?" I say, "Nah, I want all 'em."
Happiness is the same price as "red-bottoms"

My smile is beamin'
My skin is gleamin'
The way it shine
I know you've seen it

I bought a crib
Just for the closet
Both his and hers
I want it, I got it

I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it

You like my hair?
Gee, thanks! Just bought it
I see it, I like it
I want it, I got it

Yeah, my receipts be lookin' like phone numbers
If it ain't money, then wrong number
Black Card is my business card
The way it be settin' the tone for me

I don't mean to brag
But I be like, "Put it in the bag."
Yeah
When you see them racks
They stacked up like my ass
Yeah

Shoot
Go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop
Gimme the loot
Never mind, I got the juice
Nothin' but net when we shoot

Look at my neck, look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it then that's what I get
Yeah

I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
Yeah
I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
Oh, yeah, yeah

You like my hair?
Gee, thanks! Just bought it
I see it, I like it
I want it, I got it
Yeah
---------------------------------------------------
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier
I want you to be happier

When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that the story ends

Then only for a minute
I wanna change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I wanna see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier
I want you to be happier

When the evening falls
And I'm left there with my thoughts
And the image of you being with someone else
Well, it's eating me up inside
But we ran our course, we pretended we're okay
Now if we jump together at least we can swim
Far away from the wreck we made

Then only for a minute
I wanna change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I wanna see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier
I want you to be happier

So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go

Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
Even though I might not like this
I think that you'll be happier, I want you to be happier

Then only for a minute
I wanna change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I wanna see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier
I want you to be happier

So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go
---------------------------------------------------
Sandra, I'm ready to go
I don't wanna be here anymore
You're wasted and I'm bored
I supposed I'll show myself back to the door

Do you remember yesterday?
Did the conversation we had about life just float away?
I sat you down, I chose to say
You're gonna be better off without me in the way

You see everybody running around losing their minds
You wanted me to hang around and now I'm losing mine
A thousand days and you'll be doing fine
Without me
Without me

Life is wonderful on my own
A million hours left to waste in a warm window
But all I ever wanna do is fall in love
To reconvene with every dream that I've been dreaming of

You see everybody running around with their head in the clouds
All of us are doing our best to figure it out
A thousand tears and you'll be doing fine
Without me
Without me

Every night I'm growing colder
And every moon I'm feeling older
The cavalier is burning through my heart
I never wanna be alone
But here I am, pacing round my empty home
All in all, it's nothing without love

Lately I've been thinking about you
All the curiosity is near and far
What color is your hair, how I miss the way you stay
And do you still drive around your golden car

And do the birds still sing outside your window
Or is the mandolin I gave you still in tune
To this day you've never tried to get in touch with me
And I've never tried to get in touch with you

You see everybody running around in a crazy crowd
It's hard to hear when everyone's shouting out
A broken heart is never hard to find
But darling is it yours or is it mine?
All in all, I hear you're doing fine
Without me
Without me
---------------------------------------------------

I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road

I'm so tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, woah
So tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, woah

Party, trying my best to meet somebody
But everybody around me is falling in love to our song
I-I, oh I... yeah
Hate it, taking a shot 'cause I can't take it
But I don't think they make anything that strong so I hold on
I-I, oh I... yeah

I'm so tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, woah
So tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, woah


Strangers, killing my lonely nights with strangers
And when they leave, I go back to our song, I hold on
I-I, oh I...
Hurts like heaven, lost in the sound
Buzzcut season like you're still around
Can't unmiss you and I need you now
Yeah, I-I, oh I... yeah


I'm so tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, woah
So tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, woah
I'm so tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love songs
(Someone take me home)
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
('Cause I can't be alone)
Wanna go home, woah
So tired of love songs, tired of love songs (I'm so tired)
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, woah

When I'm underneath the bright lights
When I'm tryna have a good time
'Cause I'm good now you ain't mine
Now, now, now, now, don't call me up
When you're looking at my photos
Getting hot, losing control
You want me more now I let go
Now, now, now, now

I'm over you and I don't need your lies no more
'Cause the truth is, without you, boy, I'm stronger
And I know you said that I changed with my cold heart
But it was your game that left scars
Ooh, I'm over you

Don't call me up
I'm going out tonight
Feeling good now you're outta my life
Don't wanna talk about us
Gotta leave it behind
One drink and you're outta my mind
Now, now take it up
Baby, I'm on a high
You're alone, going out of your mind
When I'm here up in the club
And I don't wanna talk
So don't call me up

'Cause I'm here looking fine, babe
And I got eyes looking my way
And everybody's on my vibe, babe
Now, now, now, now, don't call me up
My friends said you were a bad man
I should have listened to them back then
And now you're tryna hit me up again
Now, now, now, now

I'm over you and I don't need your lies no more
'Cause the truth is, without you, boy, I'm stronger
And I know you said that I changed with my cold heart
But it was your game that left scars
Ooh, I'm over you

Don't call me up
I'm going out tonight
Feeling good now you're outta my life
Don't wanna talk about us
Gotta leave it behind
One drink and you're outta my mind
Now, now take it up
Baby, I'm on a high
You're alone, going out of your mind
When I'm here up in the club
And I don't wanna talk
So don't call me up

Don't call me up
So don't call me up
Don't call me up

I'm over you and I don't need your lies no more
'Cause the truth is, without you, boy, I'm stronger
And I know you said that I changed with my cold heart
But it was your game that left scars
Ooh, I'm over you

Don't call me up
I'm going out tonight
Feeling good now you're outta my life
Don't wanna talk about us
Gotta leave it behind
One drink and you're outta my mind
Now, now take it up
Baby, I'm on a high
You're alone, going out of your mind
When I'm here up in the club
And I don't wanna talk
So don't call me up

Seis de la manana tomando un cafe
Como el color de tus ojos (Extrano tu locura)
Al diablo el amor se nos fue
Si yo te lo di todo

Extrano verte sin ropa en el cuarto
Tengo secretos que no los comparto
Yo guardo tu amor en un frasco
Tu foto en un marco, bebe, dime algo

Extrano verte sin ropa en el cuarto
Tengo secretos que no los comparto
Yo guardo tu amor en un frasco
Tu foto en un marco, mi mundo es amargo

La baby que yo quiero eres tu, tu eras mi luz
Siento como que fue un deja vu
Me tienes escuchando cimbaleras por YouTube
Tal vez lo nuestro fue solo un amor de juventud
Para mi era tan profundo y tan alto
Todo lo nuestro se cayo por un barranco
Baby, yo te quise tanto
Y de nuestra historia solo quedaron hojas en blanco

Secreto, yo sigo queriendo tu calor
Tenerte a mi lado, poder hacerte el amor
Y me doy cuenta que no hay otro mejor
Que borre tu olor, que me quite el dolor

Extrano verte sin ropa en el cuarto
Tengo secretos que no los comparto
Yo guardo tu amor en un frasco
Tu foto en un marco, bebe, dime algo

Extrano verte sin ropa en el cuarto
Tengo secretos que no los comparto
Yo guardo tu amor en un frasco
Tu foto en un marco, mi mundo es amargo (Bebe, dejate llevar por el OG)

No fallo una foto en mi wallet tuya 2x2
Pa' verte a diario y si no lo hago no me siento yo
Lo de nosotros era una bomba 'e tiempo que ya estallo
Cruce la linea y el amor me atropello
Extrano en la mesa ver el reguero 'e tu maquillaje
Eres perfecta en maones, una diosa cuando usa' traje
Entre nosotros viven muchos secretos que nadie sabe
Por favor, regresa, no dejemos que esto acabe

Extrano tus peleas, extrano escucharte reir
Extrano abrazarte y darte un beso antes de dormir
Extrano tu presencia y que me reganes por maldecir
Extrano equivocarme y que tu no me venga' a corregir, baby I'm done

Extrano verte sin ropa en el bano
En verdad to'a esta mierda me hace dano
Por fuera feliz, por dentro es un engano
Porque no puedo estar sin ti

Extrano verte sin ropa en el cuarto
Tengo secretos que no los comparto
Yo guardo tu amor en un frasco
Tu foto en un marco, bebe, dime algo

You good, T-Minus?

Niggas been countin' me out
I'm countin' my bullets, I'm loadin' my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin' 'em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I'm back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get
I do not snort powder, I might take a sip
I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip
I ain't poppin' no pill, but you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends, I love 'em to death
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit
Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist
This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift
Back when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame
It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same
It won't be to sell you my latest little sneakers
It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows, it's destined to change
I love you little niggas, I'm glad that you came
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OGs, I'm thankin' you now
Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground
I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style
I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now
Fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice
I ain't do no promo, still made all that noise
This year gon' be different, I set my intentions
I promise to slap all that hate out your voice

Niggas been countin' me out
I'm countin' my bullets, I'm loadin' my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin' 'em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I'm back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on their neck, I got 'em stuck
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel
If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck
Pistol in your hand don't make you real

I'm dead in the middle of two generations
I'm little bro and big bro all at once
Just left the lab with young 21 Savage
I'm 'bout to go and meet Jigga for lunch
Had a long talk with the young nigga Kodak
Reminded me of young niggas from 'Ville
Straight out the projects, no fakin', just honest
I wish that he had more guidance, for real
Too many niggas in cycle of jail
Spending their birthdays inside of a cell
We coming from a long bloodline of trauma
We raised by our mamas, Lord, we gotta heal
We hurting our sisters, the babies as well
We killing our brothers, they poisoned the well
Distorted self-image, we set up to fail
I'ma make sure that the real gon' prevail, nigga

I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on their neck, I got 'em stuck
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel
If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck
Pistol in your hand don't make you real

Money in your palm don't make you real
Pistol in your hand don't make you real
Money in your palm don't make you real

I understood loneliness before I knew what it was
Saw the pills on the table for your unrequited love
Well, I would be nothing without you holding me up
Now I'm strong enough for both of us
Both of us, both of us, both of us

I am a giant (Ooh)
Stand up on my shoulders, tell me what you see
'Cause I am a giant (Ooh)
We'll be breaking boulders underneath our feet
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am a giant (Oh)
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am a giant (Oh)

Don't hide your emotions, you can throw down your guard
And feed from the notion we can be who we are
You taught me something, yeah, freedom is ours
It was you who taught me living is
Togetherness, togetherness, togetherness

I am a giant (Ooh)
Stand up on my shoulders, tell me what you see
'Cause I am a giant (Ooh)
We'll be breaking boulders, underneath our feet
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am a giant (Oh)
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am a giant (Oh)

(Oh, oh, oh, hey-oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, hey-oh)
I'm gonna shake, throw it away in the dirt under me, yeah, yeah
(Oh, oh, oh, hey-oh)
I'm gonna shake, throw it away in the dirt under me, yeah, yeah
(Oh, oh, oh, hey-oh)
Gonna shake, throw it away in the dirt, yeah, yeah
(Oh, oh, oh, hey-oh)
Gonna shake, throw it away in the dirt, yeah, yeah
(Oh, oh, oh, hey-oh)
Gonna shake, throw it away in the dirt, yeah, yeah
(Oh, oh, oh, hey-oh)
Gonna shake, throw it away in the dirt

(Ooh)
I am, I am, I am (Ooh)
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am a giant (Ooh)
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am a giant (Ooh)

Maluma, baby

Ella no esta buscando novio
Quiere salir a joder (Ey-yeah)
Quiere olvidarse de ese bobo
Porque el cabron le fue infiel (Oh-no-no-no)

Le rompera el corazon y no busca a nadie que se lo reponga
Solo quiere a alguien que se lo ponga
Ella quiere un man que no la llame y que no joda
Pa' reemplazar al perro que no la valora
Quiere aprovechar que esta mas buena y mas de moda
Empezo a meterle al gym desde que quedo sola
Las envidiosas dicen que eso se lo hizo el cirujano
Pero es ella misma queriendo salir del dano

Quiere salir, fumar, beber
Subir un video pa' que lo vea el
Pa' que se de cuenta de lo que perdio
Pa' que el hijueputa se sienta peor
Quiere salir, fumar, beber
Subir un video pa' que lo vea el

Y cuando se suelta
No existe una amiguita que la pare
No quiere un novio pa' rendirle cuentas
No necesita ningun HP en el party, que la pare
Y cuando se suelta
No existe una amiguita que la pare

Get to roll no...
Ayy, I'm in the studio, bro
Oh, nah, yeah, call me, ball me
Yeah, I'll... bet
Yeah, I'm at the studio, hold up though

I ain't get to roll no weed, I ain't get to roll no Swishers
I was locked up on Christmas, ain't get to see my niggas
Ain't get to hug my mama, couldn't even give her no kisses
Can't even post on my Instagram 'cause these pussy niggas be snitching
Everybody acting suspicious, might probably say that I'm tripping
When I'm all alone in my jail cell, I tend to get in my feelings
And all I smoke is that loud, don't pass me no midget
And I'ma smoke all of my pain away 'cause that's the only thing that gon' heal it
I don't understand these women who go around pretending
As if they really fuck with me, so I love 'em all from a distance
'Cause the same bitch say she down to ride be the main one who tricking
Got Molly mixed with promethazine 'cause every time

I wake up in the morning, I got murder on my mind
AK-47's, MAC-11, Glocks, and nines
And all these pussy niggas hating, tryna knock me off my grind
But I can't let 'em do it, I got murder on my mind
Bitch, I got murder on my mind (Bitch, I got murder on my mind)
I got murder on my mind (On my mind)
I got murder on my mind (I got murder on my mind)
I got murder on my mind, I got murder on my mind

Yellow tape around his body, it's a fucking homicide
His face is on a T-shirt and his family traumatized
I didn't even mean to shoot him, he just caught me by surprise
I reloaded my pistol, cocked it back, and shot him twice
His body dropped down to the floor and he got teardrops in his eyes
He grabbed me by my hands and said he was afraid to die
I told him, "It's too late, my friend, it's time to say goodbye"
And he died inside my arms, blood all on my shirt

Wake up in the morning, I got murder on my mind
AK-47's, MAC-11, Glocks, and nines
And all these pussy niggas hating, tryna knock me off my grind
But I can't let 'em do it, I got murder on my mind
Bitch, I got murder on my mind (Bitch, I got murder on my mind)
I got murder on my mind (On my mind)
I got murder on my mind
I got murder on my mind, I got murder on my mind
(I got murder on my mind)

Bite like tarantula, bitch, I'm an animal
Melly's a savage, no he not no amateur
Bad bitch named Angela, fucked her on camera
Bitch I'm a murderer (Yeah, yeah)
I might just kill the boy, don't wanna kill the boy
Bake him up, say he want beef, we gon' grill the boy
(Grill the boy, we gonna grill the boy)
I'm bleeding so good, I might dip his ass in it and spill the boy
Haha, murder on my mind, whoa, whoa
I got murder on my mind (On my mind)
I got murder on my mind, I got murder on my mind, huh

Wake up in the morning, I got murder on my mind
AK-47's, MAC-11, Glocks, and nines
And all these pussy niggas hating, tryna knock me off my grind
But I can't let 'em do it, I got murder on my mind
Bitch, I got murder on my mind
I got murder on my mind
I got murder on my mind
I got murder on my mind, I got murder on my mind

It's funny how they say when you find someone
Heart speeds up, time slows down
Things get heavy, heavy but you know we ain't done yet
It's funny how you wait 'til the moment comes
Moment's here, moment's gone
Kiss you heavy heavy but you know we ain't done yet

Cause it's those lights
Like somebody put that bluey on fire
Do you think there's anybody up high looking down
Watching us, wishing we'd enjoy the ride
'Cause we happen to be feeling alright
Whatever happens got this feeling I like
And it's happening to us
And we're not even on drugs

Why make things complicated
When we could stay like that
Why make things so much harder
We could be gone like that
We'll come across them days that go
Out their way to bring us down to our knees
So for once, baby for once
Baby for once, be here with me
Be here with me

It's funny how we say that it's all 'gon change
No more lies, no more space
When shit comes ready, ready 'cause you know we ain't done yet
I love you and you love me, but our boat is rocking
Storm's right here, let it in
But keep it steady, steady 'cause you know we ain't done yet

'Cause it's those lights
Like somebody put that bluey on fire
Do you think there's anybody up high looking down
Watching us, wishing we'd enjoy the ride
Cause we happen to be feeling alright
Whatever happens got this feeling I like
And it's happening to us
And we're not even on drugs

Why make things complicated
When we could stay like that
Why make things so much harder
We could be gone like that
We'll come across them days that go
Out their way to bring us down to our knees
So for once, baby for once
Baby for once, be here with me

'Cause it's those lights
Like somebody put that bluey on fire
Do you think there's anybody up high looking down
Watching us, wishing we'd enjoy the ride
Cause we happen to be feeling alright
Whatever happens got this feeling I like
And it's happening to us

This night is cold in the kingdom
I can feel you fade away
From the kitchen to the bathroom sink and
Your steps keep me awake

Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
I once was a man with dignity and grace
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
So please, please

Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me

If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly

Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down
Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down

If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly

Cold skin, drag my feet on the tile
As I'm walking down the corridor
And I know we haven't talked in a while
So I'm looking for an open door

Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
I once was a man with dignity and grace
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
So please, please

Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me

If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly

Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down
Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down

If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly

And I can't stop myself from falling down
And I can't stop myself from falling down
And I can't stop myself from falling down
And I can't stop myself from falling down

Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me

If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly

Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down
Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down

If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly

If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly

I'd be the voice that urged Orpheus
When her body was found
Hey yeah
I'd be the choiceless hope in grief
That drove him underground
Hey yeah
I'd be the dreadful need in the devotee
That made him turn around
Hey yeah
And I'd be the immediate forgiveness
In Eurydice
Imagine being loved by me

I won't deny I've got in my mind now (Hey, yeah)
All the things I would do
So I try to talk refined
For fear that you find out (Hey, yeah)
How I'm imagining you

I'd be the last shred of truth
In the lost myth of true love
Hey yeah
I'd be the sweet feeling of release
Mankind now dreams of
Hey yeah
That's found in the last witness before the wave hits
Marvelling at God
Hey yeah
Before he feels alone one final time
And marries the sea
Imagine being loved by me

I won't deny I've got in my mind now (Hey, yeah)
All the things I would do
So I try to talk refined
For fear that you find out (Hey, yeah)
How I'm imagining you

I won't deny I've got in my mind now (Hey, yeah)
All the things we could do
So I try to talk refined
For fear that you find out (Hey, yeah)
How I'm imagining you

Captain of the ship
Captain in my Coke
If the ship's going down
Then I'm going with the boat
And I stay down when it's going up in smoke
That's what I call high hopes
Fuck the sheep I'm the goat
I'm the G you the Joe
On her knees on a boat
Fuck her deep in the throat
In the Jeep blowing smoke
You peak in high school I peak as I go
Look, I don't give a fuck about the who's who
If you wasn't with me from the jump I gotta lose you
Bitch, excuse you
Guess she got a couple screws loose
But I eat her in the morning like some fucking Froot Loops
Yeah, then I gotta work
Call you when I get off
Promise you gon' get off
Promise you gon' get all
Give me that brain like get out then go and get on

Slow down
Girl you moving too fast, whoa now
Girl you moving too fast, slow down
Girl you moving too fast, whoa now
Girl you moving too fast
Slow down, whoa now

I got a chick from Texas her nickname Florida
Cause she love the Marlins and she fucked like four of 'em
Yeah, and if they make that trade she been hoping for
I'm pretty sure she gon' fuck a couple more of 'em
I'm a Steve so, where's my accordion
I'm in the studio recording shit til the morning hits
And by the time the morning ends I'll be mourning then
Cause I just made a couple songs and killed every one of them
At 21 I'm pretty sure that I was born again
I bought a one way ticked to the show and now I'm boarding it
I'm Scott Disick, got bitches I'm the lord of them
And I'm pretty busy but I'll call you when I'm bored again
Yeah, cause I'm starting to have fun now
I'm relaxed, wrote this in the bath like run's house
But it's my house
Blow the whistle that's a timeout

Girl you moving too fast, whoa now
Girl you moving too fast, slow down
Girl you moving too fast, whoa now
Girl you moving too fast
Slow down, whoa now
Girl you moving too fast, slow down

El booty sobresale de tu traje
No trajo pantisito pa' que el nene no trabaje

Cuenta que no quiere pero me tiene espionaje, eh-eh
El booty sobresale de tu traje

Bardi (Bardi)
He said he wants to touch it, and tease it, and squeeze it
Well my piggy bank is hungry, my nigga, you need to feed it
If the text ain't freaky, I don't wanna read it
And just to let you know, this punani is undefeated
Aye
He said he really wanna see me more
I said we should have a date, where? At the Lamborghini store
"I'm kinda scary, hard to read, I'm like a Ouija board"
"But I'm a boss bitch, who you gonna leave me for?"
You hoes got no class, you bitches is broke still

But the love be so fake, but the hate be so real (uh)

Careful when you come through my way

Work it, keep it tight every day
And I, I, I know you need a taste
When I ooh, you're fallin' in love
Give a little ooh-ooh, get it well done
Dancing on my ooh, make your girl wanna run
We keep moving 'til the sun come up
Porque I am the party, yo soy fiesta
Blow out your candles, have a siesta
They can try pero no one can stop me
What my taki taki wants, ya my taki taki gets, uh


Bailame como si fuera la ultima vez
Y ensename ese pasito que no se
Un besito bien suavecito bebe

What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

(Come here)
Say it, spit it out. What is it exactly?
You're payin'? Is the amount cleanin' you out? Am I satisfactory?
Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly
The way I'm drinkin' you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me

Step on the glass, staple your tongue (ah)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (ah-ah)
Cannibal class, killing the son (ah)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna... end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna...

What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

(Listen)
Keep you in the dark. What had you expected?
Me to make you my art and make you a star?
And get you connected?
I'll meet you in the park, I'll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart
'Cause I'm too expensive

It's probably somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now (wow)
Calling security, keepin' my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now

The debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no
Then my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close
And I can't say no, I can't say no
(Careful)

Step on the glass, staple your tongue (ah)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ah)
Cannibal class, killing the son (ah)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna... end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna...

What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy

I need somebody to heal
Somebody to know
Somebody to have
Somebody to hold
It's easy to say
But it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

Now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you

Now, I need somebody to know
Somebody to heal
Somebody to have
Just to know how it feels
It's easy to say
But it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape

Now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound til I come back around

For now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

But now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
---------------------------------------------------
Thought I found a way
Thought I found a way out (found)
But you never go away (never go away)
So I guess I gotta stay now

Oh, I hope someday I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear

Isn't it lovely? All alone
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home

Walking out of time
Looking for a better place (looking for a better place)
Something's on my mind
Always in my head space

But I know someday I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive outside I can't fight my fear

Isn't it lovely? All alone
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello. Welcome home

Whoa, yeah
Yeah, ah
Whoa, whoa
Hello, welcome home
---------------------------------------------------
What is it about them?
I must be missing something
They just keep doing nothing
Too intoxicated to be scared
Better off without them
They're nothing but unstable
Bring ashtrays to the table
And that's about the only thing they share

I'm in their second-hand smoke
Still just drinking canned Coke
I don't need a Xanny to feel better
On designated drives home
Only one who's not stoned
Don't give me a Xanny now or ever

Can you check your Uber rating?
Oh my god
(And it's like, wait, like, when?)

Waking up at sundown
They're late to every party
Nobody's ever sorry
Too inebriated now to dance
Morning as they come down (come down)
Their pretty heads are hurting (hurting)
They're awfully bad at learning (learning)
Make the same mistakes
Blame circumstance

I'm in their second-hand smoke
Still just drinking canned Coke
I don't need a Xanny to feel better
On designated drives home
Only one who's not stoned
Don't give me a Xanny now or ever

Please don't try to kiss me on the sidewalk
On your cigarette break
I can't afford to love someone
Who isn't dying by mistake
In Silver Lake

What is it about them?
I must be missing something
They just keep doing nothing
Too intoxicated to be scared

Come down
Hurting
Learning

My Lucifer is lonely

Standing there, killing time
Can't commit to anything but a crime
Peter's on vacation, an open invitation
Animals, evidence
Pearly Gates look more like a picket fence
Once you get inside 'em
Got friends but can't invite them

Hills burn in California
My turn to ignore ya
Don't say I didn't warn ya

All the good girls go to Hell
'Cause even God herself has enemies
And once the water starts to rise
And Heaven's out of sight
She'll want the Devil on her team

My Lucifer is lonely

Look at you needing me
You know I'm not your friend without some greenery
Walk in wearing fetters
Peter should know better
Your cover-up is caving in
Man is such a fool
Why are we saving him?
Poisoning themselves now
Begging for our help, wow!

Hills burn in California
My turn to ignore ya
Don't say I didn't warn ya

All the good girls go to Hell (All the good girls go to Hell)
'Cause even God herself (God herself) has enemies
And once the water starts to rise (Water starts to rise)
And Heaven's out of sight
She'll want the Devil on her team

My Lucifer is lonely
There's nothing left to save now
My God is gonna owe me
There's nothing left to save now

I cannot do the snowflake
---------------------------------------------------
Can't count up the times you've blown my line
And that's been on my mind a lot lately
I wanna leave the extra all behind, mmm
And I know that you wanna be my baby, mmm yeah

We were cool, yeah, we was vibin'
Gotta put my phone on silent

---------------------------------------------------
I look up from the ground to see your sad and teary eyes
You look away from me, and I see there' somethin' you're tryin' to hide
And I reach for your hand, but it's cold, you pull away again
And I wonder what's on your mind

And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake
You start to tremble, and your voice begins to break
You say the cigarettes on the counter
Weren't your friends, you need some space
And I feel the color drainin' from my face

And my friends say, I know you love her, man, but it's too late
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away
Let her go, it'll be alright

So I still look back at all the messages you sent
I know it wasn't right, but it was messin' with my head
And everything deleted like the past, yeah, it was gone
When I touched your face, I could tell you're movin' on

But it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday
It's the feelin' of betrayal that I just can't seem to shake
And everything tells me that I should walk away
But I just wanna stay

And my friends say, I know you love her, man, but it's too late
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away
Let her go, it'll be okay

It's gonna hurt for a bit of time
So bottoms up, let's forget it tonight
You'll find another, and you'll be just fine
Let her go

Nothing heals the past like time
And they can't steal the love you're born to find

Nothin' heals the past like time
And they can't steal the love you're born to find

I know you love her, man, but it's too late
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away
Let her go, it'll be okay

It's gonna hurt for a bit of time
So bottoms up, let's forget it tonight
You'll find another and you'll be just fine
Let her go

It'll be alright, it'll be alright
It'll be alright
---------------------------------------------------
I still see your shadows in my room
I can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you (oh)

Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listening to my heart instead of my head
You found another one
But I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

I still see your shadows in my room
I can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you (oh)

Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listening to my heart instead of my head
You found another one
But I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head

I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Did this shit in the past
But I want it to last
You were made outta plastic (fake)
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls have the prettiest face
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heart break

You made my heart break
You made my heart ache
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache
You made my heart break again

I still see your shadows in my room
I can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you (oh)

Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listening to my heart instead of my head
You found another one
But I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you (oh)

Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listening to my heart instead of my head
You found another one
But I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

Run that back, Turbo


You can get the biggest Chanel bag in the store if you want it
I gave 'em the drip, they sucked it up, I got 'em moanin'
I bought a new Patek, I had the watch, so I two-toned 'em
Takin' these drugs, I'm gon' be up until the mornin'
That ain't your car, you just a leaser, you don't own it
If I'm in the club, I got that fire when I'm performin'
The backend just came in, in all hundreds
Fives galore, cute shit, they all on us
I'm from Atlanta where young niggas run shit
I know they hatin' on me, but I don't read comments
Whenever I tell her to come, she comin'
Whenever it's smoke, we ain't runnin'


Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind
Soon as I get back, she gettin' slayed
Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise
Every other night, another movie gettin' made
Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind
Soon as I get back, she gettin' slayed
Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise (yeah)
Every other night, another movie gettin' made


Yeah, every other night, another dollar gettin' made
Every other night started with a good day
I feel like a child, I got boogers in the face
Diamonds dancin' in the dark like this shit is a parade
I don't want your chain, Young GonWunna not a slave
I had to draw the line, too many bitches gettin' saved
TSA harass me, so I took a private plane
These pussy niggas lackin', why I'm workin' on my aim
Drip too hard (too hard), charge it to the card (to the card)
Designer to the ground, I can barely spell the names
Drip too hard, caution on the floor
You gon' fuck around and drown tryna ride a nigga wave


Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind
Soon as I get back, she gettin' slayed
Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise
Every other night, another movie gettin' made
Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind
Soon as I get back, she gettin' slayed
Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise
Every other night, another movie gettin' made

I got the fire on me in BET Awards
When your well run dry, you know you need me for
When I pull up in the Buick, you know what I'm doin'
If the police get behind me, I'm fleein' and eludin'
Sleepin' on a pallet turned me to a savage

Hit that Z-Walk, Dickie's with my Reeboks

When I jumped up out the Beam', I was in Selene
Baby girl, you just a fling, that ain't what I mean
Money bustin' out my jeans like I do the scheme

Pull up in the Demon on God

Turn my headphone down a little bit, yeah
For so many reasons
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (I do), yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah, ah, ah, whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah

How much money you got? (Straight up)
How much money you got? (Straight up)
How much money you got? (Straight up)
How much money you got? (A lot)

How much money you got? (A lot)
How many problems you got? (A lot)
How many people done doubted you? (A lot)
Left you out to rot? (A lot)
How many pray that you flop? (A lot)
How many lawyers you got? (A lot)
How many times you got shot? (A lot)
How many niggas you shot? (A lot)
How many times did you ride? (A lot)
How many niggas done died? (A lot)
How many times did you cheat? (A lot)
How many times did you lie? (A lot)
How many times did she leave? (A lot)
How many times did she cry? (A lot)
How many chances she done gave you fucking around with these thots? (A lot)

Every day that I'm alive, I'ma ride with the stick
I'd rather be broke in jail than be dead and rich
Told my brothers take my breath if I turn to a snitch
But I'm 21 4L, ain't no way I'ma switch

Break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down

Penitentiary chances just to make a couple bucks
My heart so cold I could put it in my cup
Gang vs. the world, me and my dawg, it was us
Then you went and wrote a statement, and that really fucked me up
My brother lost his life and it turned me to a beast
My brother got life and it turned me to the streets
I been through the storm and it turned me to a G
But the other side was sunny, I get paid to rap on beats

How much money you got? (A lot)
How many problems you got? (A lot)
How many people done doubted you? (A lot)
Left you out to rot? (A lot)

Break it on down, I break it on down
I break it on down, I break it on down
Yeah, I just came from the A
I drove back home, six-hour drive, six-and-a-half
Before I left, I stopped by to see my nigga 21 in the studio
He had two of his kids with him right in the studio, that's when I knew
You a stand-up nigga, I love seein' shit like that

Question
How many faking they streams? (A lot)
Getting they plays from machines? (A lot)
I can see behind the smoke and mirrors
Niggas ain't really big as they seem (Hmm)
I never say anything (Nah), everybody got they thing (True)
Some niggas make millions, other niggas make memes (Hmm)
I'm on a money routine
I don't want smoke, I want cream
I don't want no more comparisons
This is a marathon and I'm aware
I been playing it back from a lack of promotions
I never was one for the bragging and boasting
I guess I was hoping the music would speak for itself, but the people want everything else
OK, no problem, I'll show up on everyone album
You know what the outcome will be
I'm batting a thousand
It's got to the point that these rappers don't even like rappin' with me
Fuck it 'cause my nigga 21 Savage just hit me
And told me he saved me a spot on a new record he got
He call it "a lot," I open my book and I jot
Pray for Tekashi, they want him to rot
I picture him inside a cell on a cot
'Flectin' on how he made it to the top
Wondering if it was worth it or not
I pray for Markelle 'cause they fucked up his shot
Just want you to know that you got it, my nigga
Though I never met you, I know that you special
And that the Lord blessed you, don't doubt it, my nigga
Dennis Smith, Jr., stay solid, my nigga
I'm on a tangent, not how I planned it
I had some fans that hopped and abandoned ship
When they thought that I wasn't gon' pan out, I got a plan
They say that success is the greatest revenge, tell all your friends
Cole on a mission, cementin' the spot as the greatest that did it
Before it all ends, nigga


How much money you got? (A lot)
How many problems you got? (A lot)
How many people done doubted you? (A lot)
Left you out to rot? (A lot)

I try to keep my secrets, but I must admit
Sometimes I drink my feelings, so I can let you in
Memories bleeding, when you touch my skin
Then you're back again, oh

And I never, ever called
It's because I hated goodbyes, you know
That I never, ever called
Because I didn't wanna let you go
And if I never, ever called
It's because I hated goodbyes, you know
So I never, ever called
Cause I didn't wanna let you know
That I'm such a bad, bad liar
And you just set my bones on fire

And I just need a hand on my mouth, when you're around
Stop it from pouring out
I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad, liar

Such a bad-
Such a bad, bad, bad, bad, liar

I tried to hide my emotions
But they're runnin' free
Sometimes they're hard to notion
I feel they're drownin' me
Why am I only open
When you're about to leave?
Yeah it makes no sense, oh
And I never, ever called
It's because I hated goodbyes, you know
That I never, ever called
Because I didn't wanna let you know

That I'm such a bad, bad liar
And you just set my bones on fire
And I just need a hand on my mouth, when you're around
Stop it from pouring out
I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad, liar

Such a bad-
Such a bad, bad, bad, bad-

If I'm bein' honest, I'll just say I wanted
Yeah, fight the feelin', I'll open up to you
I'll fight the feelin', I'll open up
And if I'm bein' honest, I'mma freefallin'
Yeah, fight the feelin', I'll open up to you

Cause you know I'm such a bad, bad liar
And you just set my bones on fire
And I just need a hand on my mouth, when you're around
Stop it from pouring out
I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad, liar

Such a bad-
Such a bad, bad, bad, bad, liar

"No, Billy, I haven't done that dance since my wife died."
"There's a whole crowd of people out there who need to learn how to do The Scarn."

Don't ask questions, you don't wanna know
Learned my lesson way too long ago
To be talkin' to you, belladonna
Shoulda taken a break, not an Oxford comma
Take what I want when I wanna
And I want ya

Bad, bad news
One of us is gonna lose
I'm the powder, you're the fuse
Just add some friction

You are my strange addiction
You are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But you are my strange addiction

"I'm really, really sorry, I think I was just relieved to see that Michael's Scarn got his confidence back."
"Yeah, Michael, the movie is amazing."
"It's like, one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life."

Deadly fever, please don't ever break
Be my reliever 'cause I don't self medicate
And it burns like a gin and I like it
Put your lips on my skin and you might ignite it
Hurts, but I know how to hide it, kinda like it (Teh)

Bad, bad news
One of us is gonna lose
I'm the powder, you're the fuse
Just add some friction

You are my strange addiction
You are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But you are my strange addiction

Bite my glass, set myself on fire
Can't you tell I'm crass? Can't you tell I'm wired?
Tell me nothing lasts, like I don't know
You could kiss my as-king about my motto

"You should enter in festivals or carnivals."
"Thoughts? Pretty good reaction."
"Pretty cool...right?"

You are my strange addiction
You are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But you are my strange addiction

"Did you like it? Did you like that?"
"Um, which part?"

Prometi olvidarte, pero a donde voy
Llevo tu recuerdo conmigo
Es mi corazon quien no te dice adios
Pero en mi mente te lo digo, oh

Hoy quiero decirle adios a la soledad
Salir a buscarte, sin ti no puedo mas
Voy a confesar lo que no dije jamas
No hay punto final

Yo te confieso, me vuelvo loco cuando tengo tu carino
Soy esclavo de tus besos, aceleran mis latidos
Tambien que sepas que se de apoco decir querer estar contigo
Tu nombre mi primer beso
Y Dutty no tu apellido

En mi desvelo
Cada que yo cierro los ojos yo a ti te veo
Poco a poco en tu recuerdo siento el deseo
De compartir contigo lo que ya no puedo
"Volvera" le digo to' el dia a la soledad
El brillo de su mirar regresara
Y se ira la oscuridad que me esta matando
"Volvera" le digo to' el dia a la soledad
Moriria si regresaras
Lady, no perdamos tiempo y dime la verdad

Yo te confieso, me vuelvo loco cuando tengo tu carino
Soy esclavo de tus besos, aceleran mis latidos
Tambien que sepas que se de apoco decir querer estar contigo
Tu nombre mi primer beso
Y Dutty no tu apellido (Ozuna)

Seria poco ya decir que quiero estar contigo
Seria poco que tu y yo seamo' solo amigo'
Hay mucho ma' en tu corazon que en el mio (Oh, oh)
Quiero abrigarte y abrazarte, que no te de frio
Nunca conocer la soledad
Seguro no querra' que se acabe la madruga' (Ah, ah-ah)
Un poco 'e vallenato pa' lo viejo recordar
Bachatita de Romeo cuando ella quiere bailar (Ooh, ooh)
Lo mas que me gusta de ella e': no necesita apariencia
Tiene die' amiga' y ninguna son competencia
Sabe lo que da, gana el auspin' en la audiencia
Entra pa' la disco y se me convierte en tendencia
Lo mas que me gusta de ella e': no necesita apariencia
Tiene die' amiga' y ninguna son competencia
Sabe lo que da, gana el auspin' en la audiencia (Woh-oh)
Entra pa' la disco y se me convierte en tendencia (Baby)

Yo te confieso, me vuelvo loco cuando tengo tu carino
Soy esclavo de tus besos, aceleran mis latidos
Tambien que sepas que se de apoco decir querer estar contigo
Tu nombre mi primer beso
Y Dutty no tu apellido (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

Manuel Turizo

(Prometi olvidarte, pero a donde voy
Llevo tu recuerdo conmigo
Es mi corazon quien no te dice adios
Pero en mi mente te lo digo, oh)
---------------------------------------------------
Running just to feel the
Night in our head for a while
It's foolish, I know
Chasing the moon between the buildings
Wouldn't it be nice
To howl just once

Suddenly I'm free
Of every heavy thing
The pain, the hurt
The sorrow, it leaves me
We run, quicksilver in the moonlight

We don't need words to speak
Just the electricity
Of silence around us
My heart calls out to you
Like a song of the sea
Trapped inside a shell

Suddenly I'm free
Of every heavy thing
The pain, the hurt
The sorrow, it leaves me
We run, quicksilver in the moonlight
Quicksilver in the moonlight

Years from now
Still see you shining in the night
Years from now
Still see you shining in the night
Years from now
Still see you shining in the night
Years from now

Watch as the sun rises
To change the magic in the air
From black to blue to gold
We walk beneath the sun
As the city inhales
And stars all over again

Once we were free
Of every heavy thing
The pain, the hurt
The sorrow that's in me
We run, quicksilver in the moonlight

Told you not to worry
But maybe that's a lie
Honey, what's your hurry?
Won't you stay inside?
Remember not to get too close to stars
They're never gonna give you love like ours

Where did you go?
I should know, but it's cold
And I don't wanna be lonely
So show me the way home
I can't lose another life

Hurry, I'm worried

The world's a little blurry
Or maybe it's my eyes
The friends I've had to bury
They keep me up at night
Said I couldn't love someone
'Cause I might break
If you're gonna die, not by mistake

So, where did you go?
I should know, but it's cold
And I don't wanna be lonely
So tell me you'll come home
Even if it's just a lie

I tried not to upset you
Let you rescue me the day I met you
I just wanted to protect you
But now I'll never get to

Hurry, I'm worried

Where did you go?
I should know, but it's cold
And I don't wanna be lonely
Was hoping you'd come home
I don't care if it's a lie
---------------------------------------------------
Take me to the rooftop
I wanna see the world when I stop breathing, turnin' blue
Tell me love is endless, don't be so pretentious
Leave me like you do (Like you do)

If you need me, wanna see me
Better hurry 'cause I'm leavin' soon

Sorry can't save me now
Sorry I don't know how
Sorry there's no way out (Sorry)
But down
Hmm, down

Taste me, the salty tears on my cheek
That's what a year-long headache does to you
I'm not okay, I feel so scattered
Don't say I'm all that matters
Leave me, deja vu (Hmm)

If you need me, wanna see me
You better hurry, I'm leavin' soon

Sorry can't save me now (Sorry)
Sorry I don't know how (Sorry)
Sorry there's no way out (Sorry)
But down
Hmm, down

Call my friends and tell them that I love them
And I'll miss them
But I'm not sorry
Call my friends and tell them that I love them
And I'll miss them
Sorry

And now, for my next number, I'd like to return to the classics

Growing up, I had a dream in my mind
Then it came true, now it got me losing my mind
I don't wanna seem ungrateful so I keep it inside
Got me reminiscing, thinking of a simpler time
Like me and Lopez used to skate down the block
Passing time, spitting rhymes at the old parking lot
I can't even drive past all the spots that I love
'Cause they're nothing even close to anything like it was
But when I see a group of kids in the spot
I wanna shake, I wanna tell 'em they don't know what they got
Wish that I could travel back and try to tell me to stop
'Cause I had everything, I never needed a lot

It's like I woke up one day and suddenly I grew up
I can't remember what had happened, it was all too abrupt
Drive around my old town, it's pathetic, I know
The only time that I was happy and I can't let it go

Was it all really better then?
Or am I just getting in my head?
And I just wanna go back
I wish that I could just go back
Was it all really better then?
Or am I just getting in my head?
And I just wanna go back
I wish that I could just go back

I would never trade a friend for the fame
But I been on the road touring and it isn't the same
Losing touch with all the ones that I love
How many calls I gotta miss 'till they stop giving a fuck?
Been feeling down so I hit up my mom
She told me everything will pass so put it all in a song
I know my family can see I got a lot on my plate
Seems like every time I'm home it's only just for the day
So I been putting all my thoughts in this verse
And I don't know that if it's helping or it's making it worse
I just know its been a while since I felt like I'm fine
I've been trying to learn to live my life one day at a time

It's like I woke up one day and suddenly I grew up
I can't remember what had happened, it was all too abrupt
Drive around my old town, it's pathetic, I know
The only time that I was happy and I can't let it go

Was it all really better then?
Or am I just getting in my head?
And I just wanna go back
I wish that I could just go back
Was it all really better then?
Or am I just getting in my head?
And I just wanna go back
I wish that I could just go back

Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up!

Future took the business and ran it for me

Prayed, then I prayed again (Amen, Lord)

Pinky ring 'til I get a wedding ring (Whoa, yeah)

Got a bubba on my other hand (Whoa, yeah, shit, yeah)
This shit ain't no hundred bands (Nah, nah, nah, nah)
Palace look like Buckingham
Bills so big, I call 'em Williams, for real
Reasons to go crazy, got a trillion, for real
They been tryin' me but I'm resilient, for real
I can't go in public like civilian, for real
And I hardly take offense
Money for revenge, man, that's hardly an expense
Al Haymon checks off of all of my events
I like all the profit, man, I hardly do percents (I don't do that shit)
A big part of me resents
Niggas that I knew from when I started in this shit
They see what I got and, man, it's hard to be content
Fuck what they got goin' on, I gotta represent (Ayy!)

That Arizona sky burning in your eyes
You look at me and, babe, I wanna catch on fire
It's buried in my soul like California gold
You found the light in me that I couldn't find

So when I'm all choked up
But I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye
Baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way

Lovers in the night
Poets tryna write
We don't know how to rhyme
But damn we try
But all I really know
You're where I wanna go
The part of me that's you will never die

So when I'm all choked up
But I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye
Baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way

Oh, yeah
I don't wanna be just a memory, baby, yeah
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo

And the whole world fades
I'll always remember us this way

If you take too long to hit me back
I can't promise you how I'll react
But all I can say
Is at least I'll wait for you

Lately, I've been on a roller-coaster
Tryna get a hold of my emotions
But all that I know
Is I need you close

And I'ma scream and shout for what I love
Passionate, but I don't give no fucks
I admit that I'm a lil' messed up
But I can hide it when I'm all dressed up

I'm obsessive and I love too hard
Good at overthinking with my heart
How you even think it got this far?
This far

And I can be needy, way too damn needy
I can be needy, tell me how good it feels to be needed
I can be needy, so hard to please me
I know it feels so good to be needed

Sorry if I'm up and down a lot (Yeah)
Sorry that I think I'm not enough
And sorry if I say "sorry" way too much

You can go ahead and call me selfish (Selfish)
But after all this damage, I can't help it (Help it, yeah)
But what you can trust is I need your touch

I'ma scream and shout for what I love
Passionate, but I don't give no fucks
I admit that I'm a lil' messed up
But I can hide it when I'm all dressed up

I'm obsessive and I love too hard
Good at overthinking with my heart
How you even think it got this far?
This far

And I can be needy, way too damn needy
I can be needy, tell me how good it feels to be needed
I can be needy, so hard to please me
I know it feels so good to be needed

(Hmm, oh-ah)
(Oh-ah)
---------------------------------------------------
Don't you know I'm no good for you?
I've learned to lose you, can't afford to
Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'
But nothin' ever stops you leavin'

Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

Don't you know too much already?
I'll only hurt you if you let me
Call me friend but keep me closer (Call me back)
And I'll call you when the party's over

Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
Yeah I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

But nothing is better sometimes
Once we've both said our goodbyes
Let's just let it go
Let me let you go

Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, and say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, and say I like it like that, like it like that

Sin ti no me va bien, tampoco me va mal
Pase lo que pase no te voy a llamar
Ya yo me quite, tu nunca me va' a amar
Pa' no pensar en ti tengo que fumar

Sin ti no me va bien, tampoco me va mal
Pase lo que pase no te voy a llamar
Ya yo me quite, tu nunca me va' a amar
Pa' no pensar en ti tengo que fumar

Hoy voy a romper la noche, hoy yo voy a janguear
Hoy voy a prender y no lo voy a pasar
Te juro por mami que en ti no vo'a pensar
Errores como tu no me vuelven a pasar (¡Yeh!)
A veces las noches se vuelven martirio
Como nuestro amor que se volvio un delirio
Mi alma esta en guerra, es terreno sirio (¡Ey!)
Las botellas de vinos terminan en vidrios (¡Ey!)
Y tu puta, en verdad no te envidio (¡Ey!)

Pero nada
Tu vas a extranarme cuando abras la cartera y no tengas nada
Cuando el te lo meta y no sientas nada
Cuando te sientas sola, perdida en la nada
Tu puedes arreglarlo, pero no haces nada
Baby, gracias por nada (¡Ey!)
Ahora sobran los totos y los chavos (¡Ey!)
Tu amiga dando like, si le meto, la grabo (¡Ey!)
Me cago en tu madre y la de tu abogado
Prende la radio, te dejo un recado

Sin ti no me va bien, tampoco me va mal
Pase lo que pase no te voy a llamar
Ya yo me quite, tu nunca me va' a amar
Pa' no pensar en ti tengo que fumar

Sin ti no me va bien, tampoco me va mal
Pase lo que pase no te voy a llamar
Ya yo me quite, tu nunca me va' a amar
Pa' no pensar en ti tengo que fumar

Lo mejor de todo es que ahora pa' salir
No tengo que esperar que te termines de vestir
Hoy es noche 'e maldad y me voy a divertir
A tu amiga la acabo e' partir
Como dice Miky, "No te vo'a mentir" (No te vo'a mentir)
Fui uno mas pa' tu coleccion
No se, entre tu y yo, ya no hay conexion
Pa'l carajo el perdon, no hay reconciliacion
Ahora te toca llorar en tu habitacion
Yo nunca forzo, dejo que todo fluya
Quieren mi vida y no pueden con la suya

Sin ti no me va bien, tampoco me va mal
Pase lo que pase no te voy a llamar
Ya yo me quite, tu nunca me va' a amar
Pa' no pensar en ti tengo que fumar

Sin ti no me va bien, tampoco me va mal
Pase lo que pase no te voy a llamar
Ya yo me quite, tu nunca me va' a amar
Pa' no pensar en ti tengo que fumar

I remember how it all started
Feeling warm though the summer was over
And our little lives, it felt so big then
We're only reaching stars at night
In the big black sky
And you said to me

If you love me, then say you love me
And you are mine
Hey come on darling, stop the hiding
Speak your mind

Woah, I loved you
But you left me speechless then
Say if you love me, then say you love me
That you are mine

I remember how it all started
Feeling warm tough the summer was over
And our little lives, it felt so big then
We're only reaching stars at night

And you are mine
Hey come on darling, stop the hiding
Speak your mind

Woah, I loved you
But you left me speechless then
Say if you love me, then say you love me
That you are mine

You left me speechless
Speechless
You left me speechless

You left me speechless
Speechless
You left me speechless
Speechless

So if you love me, then say you love me
And you are mine
Hey come on darling
Speechless

One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me

Let me take the night, I love real easy
And I know that you'll still wanna see me
On the Sunday morning, music real loud
Let me love you while the moon is still out

Something in you
Lit up heaven in me
The feeling won't let me sleep
'Cause I'm lost in the way you move, the way you feel

One kiss is all it takes

Hey
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful angel
Love your imperfections, every angle
Tomorrow comes and goes before you know
So I just had to let you know

The way that Gucci look on you amazing
But nothing can compare to when you're naked
Now a Backwood and some Henny got you faded
You're saying you're the one for me, I need to face it

Started when we were younger
Swear to God that I loved her
Sorry that your mum found out
Guess that we just really had the thunder
Ain't nobody else said I'd be under
Beautiful, beautiful life right now
Beautiful, beautiful night right now
No, no, no

Hey
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful angel
Love your imperfections, every angle
Tomorrow comes and goes before you know
So I just had to let you know

The way that dress fall off you is amazing
Love a miracle, a beautiful creation
Baby, come a little closer let me taste it
You came a little closer, now you're shaking

Never ever gon' mislead you
Don't believe the lies they feed you
Stop and stare like a sculpture
Painted in your colors
Beautiful, beautiful life right now
Beautiful, beautiful night right now
Beautiful, beautiful by my side right now, yeah

Hey

I wasn't higher than I was supposed to be
But the walls froze through then they shatter
I'm partially peaceful sitting in an empty room
While the lights outside never matter
There's a bitter pill on the other side
Smoky shaded space in a double-wide
We could come to the middle
Let it all pass through

I'm a pretender
It's like being the morning sun
All the lies I live make me wonder
I had a bottle
Filled it with the only one
That could turn my nights into thunder
How I wish it could be another way
And I wouldn't stumble and go away
Yeah, it makes you cry just a little
If it does us any good
I cannot see it

And I am shaping a madness

were planned
While the world spins faster than ever
And they say it's burning
All the things you need to say
You better get out now while you're limber
Morning never cuts like I want it to
There's a canyon in between me and you
And I would bleed just a little
And never be the same

Why am I so tired when all I do is sleep
Is it the same dream that I keep having
You there with me lying in a naked seat
But there was ample shelter and padding
But the wind whispers in a darkened street
Selling simple warnings to you and me
Yeah it makes me die just a little
A little every day

We don't wanna believe it, that it's all gone
Just a matter of minutes, before the sun goes down
We're afraid to admit it, but I know you know, know that
We should've known better, we kept on trying
I just stand now and see it, the fire's dying out
Can't believe that I see this, we're out of chances now
And I just want you to know that

You and me it was good but it wasn't right
And it'll be hard but I know I will make it out
Step by step, I'll move on and get on with life
So I let go, and I hope you'll be happy now
You and me it was good but it wasn't right

Yeah, I hope you'll be happy now
I hope you'll be happy now
Yeah, I hope you'll be happy now
Yeah, I hope you'll be happy now
I hope you'll be happy now

Thought we would make it, if I just held on
But it's really crazy, how love could fade so fast
We said "forever", but now we're in the past
And I just want you to know that

You and me it was good but it wasn't right
And it'll be hard but I know I will make it out
Step by step I'll move on and get on with life
So I let go and I hope you'll be happy now

My best friend never had a lot of money
He met a girl and he just kept runnin'
She had a fire and it just kept blazin'
Tried and tried and just couldn't tame it

And he called last night
Said she's gone
I'm alright but I'm all alone
Growing up breaks you down
All the leaves have fallen to the ground

And everything changes
And everything changes
And everything changes
And everything changes

I found out in the couch in the basement
The kind of day where it just doesn't stop rainin'
It's not you're fault they just kept saying
Tried and tried but we just couldn't make it

And I drove that night
No place to go
Got so high but I felt so low
Growing up breaks you down
All the leaves have fallen to the ground

And everything changes
And everything changes
And everything changes
And everything changes

My best friend never had a lot of money
He met a girl and he never saw it coming
He found a love that just kept blazin'
Tried and tried and just couldn't shake it

And everything changes
And everything changes
And everything changes
And everything changes
And everything changes
And everything changes
And everything changes
And everything changes
And everything changes
And everything changes
And everything changes
And everything changes

One time just a little bit, I

I-I-I don't wanna get close
I haven't been the same since I loved that ho
I haven't been the same since I lost my bro
I say I'm gonna change when I know I won't
I get high, I love to smoke
She gon' lie like I'm a joke
You wanna take flights across the coast
Remember those times no horoscope

Life goes on, I can't take breaks
I need face, no, I need faith
In my mind, I can't escape
I climb these heights like I'm a ape
Shine so bright in a world so dark
Break the bank, I'ma break the chart
Two door coupe, just push to start
Come right in, let me break your heart

I don't need no one
I don't need no one
I don't need no one
Still never sober
Still never sober
Got the world on my shoulders
Comin' out bolder
Yeah, I'm comin' out bolder
I ride with my soldiers
Ride for my soldiers
Thought that I told you
I thought that I told you

I-I-I don't wanna get close
I haven't been the same since I loved that ho
I haven't been the same since I lost my bro
I say I'm gonna change when I know I won't
I get high, I love to smoke

She gon' lie like I'm a joke
You wanna take flights across the coast
Remember those times no horoscope

I-I-I don't want the fame
I don't want to play these games
Tired of hiding from the pain
Never hanging with the lames
I-I'm not the one for the stupid shit
We shot a scene on some movie shit
And she came right through on some groupie shit
Be surprised how they act when they know you lit

I don't wanna get close
I haven't been the same since I loved that ho
I haven't been the same since I lost my bro
And I say I'm gonna change when I know I won't
I get high, I love to smoke
She gon' lie like I'm a joke
You wanna take flights across the coast
Remember those times no horoscope
I-I-I don't wanna get close
I haven't been the same since I loved that ho
I haven't been the same since I lost my bro
And I say I'm gonna change when I know I won't
I get high, nigga yes I smoke
She gon' lie like I'm a joke
You wanna take flights across the coast
Remember those times no horoscope

This is one small step for woman
One giant leap for woman-kind

I'd rather be alone tonight
You can say "I love you" through the phone tonight
Really don't wanna be in your arms tonight
I'll just use my covers to stay warm tonight
Think I'm better off here all alone tonight
Ain't no checkin' on when I get home tonight
Just makin' sure I'm good on my own tonight
Even though there isn't nothin' wrong tonight

Yeah, I'm just sayin', baby
I can't really miss you if I'm with you
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I kiss you
Baby, you know time apart is beneficial
It's like I'm the universe and you'll be N-A-S-A

Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)

Bottom line
Usually, I would love it if you stayed the night
I just think I'm on another page tonight
It ain't nothing wrong with saying I need me time

Usually, I would orbit around you
But gravity seems to be the only thing that's pulling me
You'll be my rise and shine soon as them stars align, mmm

Baby, I can't really miss you if I'm with you
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I kiss you
Baby, you know time apart is beneficial
It's like I'm the universe and you'll be N-A-S-A

Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)

You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover
Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under
You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover
(You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover)
Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under
(Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under)

I'd rather be alone tonight (Mmm)
You can say "I love you" through the phone tonight
Ah, hmm-mmm

Aura
No va a ser tan facil
Aunque me esquives como quiera
Tras de ti, voy tras de ti (yeh)
Tu tienes todo lo que quiero para mi


Y tu tan sola por ahi
Detras de ti voy a seguir
Yo se que lo bueno toma tiempo, lady


Es que me gustas tu na' ma'
No me importan las demas
Una vaina loca que me da
Que por mas que intento no se va


Me gustas tu na' ma'
No importan las demas
Una vaina loca que me da
Que por mas que intento no se va


Me gustas tu na' ma', no se disimular
La musica que hago solo en ti me hace pensar
Unica, una rosa yo me la quiero robar
Sencilla, bonita, no se tiene que maquillar
Me mata el piquete
Baila duro y le mete
Con nadie se compromete
Y menos si tu le promete
Tiene lo que quiero
Me tira que yo le llego
No se disimular, bailo contigo y yo me entrego
Me mata el piquete
Baila duro y le mete
Con nadie se compromete
Y menos si tu le promete
Tiene lo que quiero
Me tira que yo le llego
No se disimular, bailo contigo y yo me entrego


Es que me gustas tu na' ma'
No me importan las demas
Una vaina loca que me da
Que por mas que intento no se va


Es que me gustas tu na' ma'
No me importan las demas
Una vaina loca que me da
Que por mas que intento no se va


Porque cuando te tengo cerquita
Me entra una vaina loca que despues no se me quita
Es que en mi lista tu eres la favorita
Tu eres la unica que este hombre necesita
Baby tu eres lo que yo quiero
Vale mas que el dinero
Yo viajo el mundo entero
Si es por ti no hay pero
Siento que por ti desespero
Cuando no te tengo mas


Es que me gustas tu na' ma'
No me importan las demas
Una vaina loca que me da
Que por mas que intento no se va


Me gustas tu na' ma'
No me importan las demas
Una vaina loca que me da
Que por mas que intento no se va

You act like you need remindin'
Tryna do it over, bring it back and rewind it
But all that glitters isn't gold, I was blinded
Should have never gave you my heart on consignment

And I can't believe the lies that I went for
Thought you was mine, but you decided to be with him though
You took my feelings and just threw 'em out the window
Feel like it's too hard to fall in love again, no

On some nights like this, shawty, I can't help but think of us
I've been reminiscin', sippin', missin' ya
Can you tell me what's with all this distant love?
If I called, would you pick it up?
On some nights like this, I just wanna text you, but for what?
You gon' say you want me, then go switch it up
Just gon' play with my emotions just because, no (Oh)

All them times I played the fool for you
Thinkin' we could put it back together, thought we had forever
You never see my point of view
Our connection is so severed, you don't show no effort

And I can't believe the lies that I went for
Thought you was mine, but you decided to be with him though
Took my feelings and just threw 'em out the window
Feel like it's too hard to fall in love again, no

On some nights like this, shawty, I can't help but think of us
I've been reminiscin', sippin', missin' ya
Can you tell me what's with all this distant love?
If I called, would you pick it up?
On some nights like this, I just wanna text you, but for what?
You gon' say you want me, then go switch it up
Just gon' play with my emotions just because, no (Oh)

You gon' get my hopes high, girl
You gon' get my hopes high, girl
Just gon' tell me more lies, girl
Just gon' get my hopes high, girl


I've been way too good to you, you take me for granted
You was my day one since back at Big B's house on Adams
First day that we met, I flagged you down, I told you, "Hit my line."
Used to promise me you'd never switch on me like Gemini
You think I'm a fool, ain't nobody stupid
I see all the signs, I see all the clues
Yeah, sometimes I reminisce 'bout that shit when I'm bingin'
Can't believe it's been a whole year, yeah, but...


{On some nights like this}, shawty, I can't help but think of us
I've been reminiscin', sippin', missin' ya (Missin' ya)
Can you tell me what's with all this distant love? (Love)
If I called, would you pick it up?
On some nights like this, I just {wanna text you, but for what?}
You gon' say you want me, then go switch it up {Switch it up}
Just gon' play with my emotions just because, no (Oh)


You gon' get my hopes high, girl
You gon' get my hopes high, girl
Just gon' tell me more lies, girl
Just gon' get my hopes high, girl

Summer nights all align
As we drown in the moonlight
We collide in plain sight
Yeah, I know we'll be alright

And we come alive, we run the night with strangers
'Cause in the end, we're all familiar faces
We're young and wild, enjoy the ride, we made it
We made it

I don't need no sleep
'Cause I'm already dreaming, already dreaming
Say you'll never leave
Because I love the feeling, I love the feeling
Find myself awake at night
See you through my lucid eyes
Oh, I don't need no sleep
'Cause I'm already dreaming, already dreaming

I don't need no sleep
'Cause I'm already dreaming, already dreaming

Wide awake, no time to waste
Make a mark on my timeline
We're safe and sound, we come around
We are dancing, the sun down

And we come alive, we run the night with strangers
'Cause in the end, we're all familiar faces
We're young and wild, enjoy the ride, we made it
We made it

I don't need no sleep
'Cause I'm already dreaming, already dreaming
Say you'll never leave
Because I love the feeling, I love the feeling
Find myself awake at night
See you through my lucid eyes
Oh, I don't need no sleep
'Cause I'm already dreaming, already dreaming

Oh, I don't need no sleep
'Cause I'm already dreaming, already dreaming

Oh, I don't need no sleep
'Cause I'm already dreaming, already dreaming
---------------------------------------------------
I still remember the message
On my phone, on a late night in Texas
All these memories work like magic
I'm feeling so nostalgic
Thinking how we used to have it all back then

Well, I hope you're happy now
I hope you're good
If you could just be here right now
I'd be all good
Yeah, I know you've found what you're looking for
I know you did what you had to do
Well, I hope you're happy now
I hope you're all good

I hope you're all good
I hope you're all good
If you could just be here right now
I'd be all good
If you could just be here right now
I'd be all good

We got lost in the moment
In present tense it feels so tense without you
Last goodbyes were never spoken
And it left me fucking broken
Thinking 'bout the way we used to have it all

Well, I hope you're happy now
I hope you're good
If you could just be here right now
I'd be all good

I hope you're all good
I hope you're all good
If you could just be here right now
I'd be all good
If you could just be here right now
I'd be all good

365 and a day, that's how you know

The mission is before us, a coded gene inside us
A mathematic function I need, I'm monotonic
Conquering the highlife, hiding from the daylight
Sequences are feeding my killing, my correlation

Searching for the borders, a future in disorder
Analog corruption amongst the population
Altering the skyline, delete it from the baseline
365 becoming me, come with me, come with me, come with me

365 and a day, that's how you know
It is hard to say no
Before you learn to let go

365 and a day, that's how you know
It is hard to say no
Before you learn to let go
Come with me, come with me
365 and a day to save my soul
Just keep on, let the days go
We keep on telling them no

The mission to divide us will only unify us
The systematic functions erase the anachronic
Plan to set the outline, form you to the hive-mind
Frequencies are seeding your feeding, your automation

Decode the synchronizer, analyze the cipher
A parasitic system that feeds the embryonic
World beneath the high rise, a torment for the sidelined
365, and now you come with me

(Come with me, come with me)
(Follow me, follow me)
(Come with me, come with me)
And bow down before me!

365 and a day, that's how you know
It is hard to say no
Before you learn to let go
Come with me, come with me
365 and a day to save my soul
Just keep on, let the days go
We keep on telling them no

(3, 6, 5 and a day)

365 and a day, that's how you know
It is hard to say no
Before you learn to let go

365 and a day, that's how you know
It is hard to say no
Before you learn to let go
Come with me, come with me
365 and a day to save my soul
Just keep on, let the days go
We keep on telling them no
---------------------------------------------------
Wait a minute, let me finish
I know you don't care, but can you listen?
I came committed, guess I overdid it
Wore my heart out on a chain around my neck
But now it's missin'

So I think I better go
I never really know how to please you
You're lookin' at me like I'm see-through
I guess I'm gonna go
I just never know how you feel
Do you even feel anything?

You said, "Don't treat me badly,"
But you said it so sadly
So I did the best I could
Not thinking you would have left me gladly
I know you're not sorry
Why should you be?
'Cause who am I to be in love
When your love never is for me, me

So I think I better go
I never really know how to please you
You're lookin' at me like I'm see-through
I guess I'm gonna go
I just never know how you feel
Do you even feel anything?
---------------------------------------------------
Spent 24 hours, I need more hours with you
You spent the weekend getting even, ooh
We spent the late nights making things right between us

Maybe I know that I'm drunk
Maybe I know you're the one
Maybe you're thinking it's better if you drive

Oh, 'cause girls like you run 'round with guys like me
'Til sundown when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah
'Cause girls like you run 'round with guys like me
'Til sundown when I come through

Bat les couilles d'l'Himalaya, bat les couilles, j'vise plus l'sommet
Mon cœur fait "oulalala", crime passionnel que j'commets
Sur ton cœur j'fais trou d'boulette, j'fais tache de sang sur le pull
J'desire nullement vous connaitre, ni toi, ni ces fils de putes
J'me tire d'ici si j'm'ecoute, sang corse melange bougnoule
La Lune, j'l'aime plus, j'vous la laisse, j'm'endors sous dore, sous gnole
J'suis ni chez moi ni d'chez vous, elle veut la bise, elle veut qu'j'la baise
J'connais la route, j'connais l'adresse, j't'encule sur l'continent d'Hades
Sale comme Taneche, meches courtes, forte comme la ppe-f' qu'j'ecoule
J'tire la gueule, j'n'ecoute que mon ame seule, Mektoub
J'vis dans un reve erotique ou j'parle peu mais j'caresse le monde
J'meurs dans un cauchemar exotique ou la Terre ressemble a ma tombe, igo
Pourquoi toi, tu parles en igo? Si ca s'tue, ouais, dis-moi qui signe
Pas d'honneur, toi, tu sens d'ici, wAllah, baba m'a dit: "Mon fils, nan, nan
Toi, pas calculer ces pedales, moi, j'ai donne pendant longtemps
Puis, j'ai perdu mes petales"

Au DD, j'la passe, la detaille, la pe-cou, la vi-sser, des regrets d'vant ton bebe
J'sors de chez toi, j'reprends ta voiture mal garee puis j'retire ton PV
J'recherche un billet, des affaires, des plans dans la planque, un peu trop peine
J'fais un bisou a mes cafards dans la cave, du 6, les pectoraux gaines
Les BACqueux te-ma parce que les ients-cli ne tomberont jamais sur messagerie
Eh, poto, demarre dans la jungle, j'y suis H24, j'y fais des singeries
La rue, j'la devale a toute allure avec du Gucci comme Mitch
J'me promene dans les beaux quartiers avec le seum qui fait peur aux riches

Que la famille, personne nous inquiete jusqu'au dernier gramme
Toujours dans mon 91 parce que j'suis baise par Paname
(Sans, sans, sans l'benef de la rue, j'aurais jamais nique le game)
Me sens pas trop humain, un peu comme mes igos habites, yah
Y a du sang a vider, yah
Au DD, DD, DD, deuxieme degre, j'suis efface, yah
T'as reconnu le cri, cote animal, merde j'connais le prix, l'canon a Nyma.
Au DD
Que la famille dans le bat', on te la push, taille-de au DD
Pas melange, cœur d'etranger, rien n'a change
C'qu'il doit arriver va arriver, yah
C'est peut-etre mon dernier album, p't-etre ma derniere puta, p't-etre mon dernier sourire de toi, dans mon gars, dans mon gars
Pas plus de haine que d'amour, que j'largue entre mes tours
Moins d'humains apres minuit, je sors casse, mon tour sur un nuage de l'Enfer
Viens, on s'casse, mon frere, avant qu'on s'perde

Au DD, j'la passe, la detaille, la pe-cou, la vi-sser, des regrets d'vant ton bebe
J'sors de chez toi, j'reprends ta voiture mal garee puis j'retire ton PV
J'recherche un billet, des affaires, des plans dans la planque, un peu trop peine
J'fais un bisou a mes cafards dans la cave, du 6, les pectoraux gaines
Les BACqueux te-ma parce que les ients-cli ne tomberont jamais sur messagerie
Eh, poto, demarre dans la jungle, j'y suis H24, j'y fais des singeries
La rue, j'la devale a toute allure avec du Gucci comme Mitch
J'me promene dans les beaux quartiers avec le seum qui fait peur aux riches

Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood

Laying on the bathroom floor, feeling nothing
I'm overwhelmed and insecure, give me something
I could take to ease my mind slowly
Just have a drink and you'll feel better
Just take her home and you'll feel better
Keep telling me that it gets better
Does it ever?

Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me
I'm crawling in my skin
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood

It isn't in my blood

I'm looking through my phone again feeling anxious
Afraid to be alone again, I hate this
I'm trying to find a way to chill, can't breathe, oh
Is there somebody who could...

Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me
I'm crawling in my skin
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood

It isn't in my blood

I need somebody now
I need somebody now
Someone to help me out
I need somebody now

Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood

It isn't in my blood
It isn't in my blood
I need somebody now
It isn't in my blood
I need somebody now
It isn't in my blood

Ring! Do you hear me callin'?
(Purps On The Beat)
Me no want no drama

Do you hear me callin'?
Do you hear me callin'?
Me no want no drama
Not a fighter, a lover

Do you hear me callin'?
Do you hear me callin'?
Me no want no drama
I just want you, my darlin'

Break away
And make a way to make it
Love the way you lookin'
When you're naked
Treat your heart just like a blunt of OG
Roll it up, I kiss it and I smoke it

Gots to be jokin'
Where in the fuck did you think you were goin'?
Foldin' and packin' your clothes
Like you ain't know I was gon' unfold it
A wine-glass full of your emotions
Oh Pinot Grigio, sippin' beautiful
Heaven-soul woman

Me don't know, let me know
Let me in your heart
Don't you dare forget me
I'm your fan, your poster's on my walls
Inside my head, yeah, yeah
I'm your fan, your poster's on my wall
Inside my head, yeah, yeah

Do you hear me callin'?
Do you hear me callin'?
Me no want no drama
Not a fighter, a lover

Me no want no drama

You drive me insane
No girl make me feel this way, wait
Girl, you got your ways
Girl, you are my getaway wait
Let me keep you safe
In exchange, give me brain, brain
You're my main thing
Turn around, bang, bang

Hit the beach in L.A. like you a beach ball
Me and you in the Lambo' truck
You start it up and skirt off
We park after dark at the park by the Mansion
Take your skirt off
Oh, me, can't wait to get all up inside of it

My heart is racin' every time I'm tastin' it
Wait until the drugs fade out
Hate makin' love when I'm faded
That's because I wanna feel it
Girl, you give me the best feeling
Yes, girl, you the best, take away stress
You love me to death
Even when I'm a mess

Ring! Do you hear me callin'?
Me no want no drama

Do you hear me callin'?
Do you hear me callin'?
Me no want no drama
Not a fighter, a lover

Do you hear me callin'?

Ring, do you hear me calling?
Me no want no drama
Ring, do you hear me calling?
Me no want no drama

After laughter comes tears
After laughter comes tears

Another night, another party
Sayin' "Hi" to everybody
I'm sorry
It's time to leave, I gotta leave now
Got somewhere I gotta be now
I'm starving

Can somebody walk me to my car?
If I go alone, I'm not gon' make it very far
I'm happy for the love
And all of the above
If I'm being honest, I done been through way too much

I can't fake another smile
I can't fake like I'm alright
Ooh, ah (Ooh, ah)
And I won't say I'm feeling fine
After what I been through, I can't lie
Ooh, ah (Ooh, ah)

Fuck a fake smile, smile
Fuck a fake smile, fake smile

I read the things they write about me
Hear what they're sayin' on the TV
It's crazy
It's gettin' hard for them to shock me
But every now and then, it's shocking
Don't blame me

I know it's the life that I chose
But, baby, I'm grateful. I want you to know
I'm happy for the love
And all of the above
If I'm being honest, I done been through way too much

I can't fake another smile
I can't fake like I'm alright
Ooh, ah (Ooh, ah)
And I won't say I'm feeling fine
After what I been through, I can't lie
Ooh, ah (Ooh, ah)

Fuck a fake smile, smile
Fuck a fake smile, fake smile

If I'm hurt, I ain't gon' lie about it
Arms crossed with the attitude, lips pouted
If I'm mad, I ain't gon' lie about it
Neck roll with the attitude, yeah

If I'm hurt, I ain't gon' lie about it
Arms crossed with the attitude, lips pouted
If I'm mad, I ain't gon' lie about it
Neck roll with the attitude, yeah

I can't fake another smile (And I can't fake)
I can't fake like I'm alright (Another smile)
Ooh, ah (Ooh, ah) (Ooh)
And I won't say I'm feeling fine (I'm feeling fine)
After what I been through, I can't lie
Ooh, ah (Ooh, ah)

Fuck a fake smile, smile
Fuck a fake smile, fake smile (Yeah)

Wish I could get a little un-drunk so I could un-call you
At five in the morning, I would un-fuck you

Honestly, this party's over
Everyone here should have gone home
But I'm afraid of being sober
'Cause the first thing I do when I'm alone

I start touching myself to the photos that you used to send me
I should have deleted, but kept it a secret
Is that crazy to do?
So I squeeze out the lime on the ice of my drink
And the juice hits the cuts on my fingers
It still doesn't burn as much as the thought of you

Wish I could get a little un-drunk so I could un-call you
At five in the morning, I would un-fuck you
But some things you can't undo
I wish I could un-kiss the room full of strangers
So I could un-spite you, un-lose my temper
But some things you can't undo
And one of them's you

I'm afraid to turn the lights on
I don't wanna face this rebound
Is it weird if I come over?
I want to, but I know that she's around

So I'm touching myself to the photos that you used to send me
I should have deleted, but kept it a secret
Is that crazy to do?
Oh, I'm hungry and wasted and my hands are shaking
I shouldn't be cooking, but spilling hot water
It still doesn't burn as much as the thought of you

Wish I could get a little un-drunk so I could un-call you
At five in the morning, I would un-fuck you
But some things you can't undo
I wish I could un-kiss the room full of strangers
So I could un-spite you, un-lose my temper
But some things you can't undo
And one of them's you

Been through every emotion
Right now I'm sad and broken
Like the bottles on the floor
But I'm too buzzed to clean 'em up

Wish I could get a little un-drunk so I could, I could un-love you

Wish I could get a little un-drunk so I could un-call you
At five in the morning, I would un-fuck you
But some things you can't undo
I wish I could un-kiss the room full of strangers
So I could un-spite you, un-lose my temper
But some things you can't undo
And one of them's you
You, you, wish I could un-love you
You, you, you, wish I could un-call you, yeah
You, you, you, wish I could un-fuck you, you
Wish I could un-love you

---------------------------------------------------
I'm eleven minutes away and I have missed you all day
I'm eleven minutes away, so why aren't you here?


I think I missed you calling on the other line
I'm just thinking all these thoughts up in my mind
Talking love but I can't even read the signs
I would sell my soul for a bit more time
You stain all on my body like you're red wine
You're the fucking acid to my alkaline
You run your middle finger up and down my spine
I'm sorry there was no one to apologize
I'm so fucking sorry, I'm so fucking sorry
I've been playing somebody and it's helping nobody
And her lipstick arithmetic didn't stick
And now I'm sick, throwing fits
And yeah, I've seen you in my head every fucking day since I left
You on the floor with your hands 'round your head
And I'm down and depressed
All I want is your head on my chest
Touching feet in my bed


I'm eleven minutes away and I have missed you all day
I'm eleven minutes away, so why aren't you here?

You're eleven minutes away and I have missed you all day
You're eleven minutes away, so why aren't you here?


Tell me what you need
I can make you more than what you are
Come and lay the roses on the floor
Every single Sunday, don't get bored
I just want to freeze
I can give you more than what you are
Now I see you standing all alone
I never thought the world would turn to stone


So call me stupid, call me sad
You're the best I've ever had
You're the worst I've ever had
And that keeps fucking with my head
Call me stupid, call me sad
You're the best I've ever had
You're the worst I've ever had
And that keeps fucking with my head


I'm eleven minutes away and I have missed you all day
I'm eleven minutes away, so why aren't you here?

(Why aren't you here?)
You're eleven minutes away and I have missed you all day
You're eleven minutes away, so why aren't you here?
(Why aren't you here?)


So call me stupid, call me sad
You're the best I've ever had
You're the worst I've ever had
And that keeps fucking with my head
Call me stupid, call me sad
You're the best I've ever had
You're the worst I've ever had
And that keeps fucking with my head


You're eleven minutes away and I have missed you all day
So why aren't you here?
Why aren't you here?
Why aren't you here?
Why aren't you here?
Why aren't you here?

(Hit-Boy)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(TrapAdix)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, I was ridin' 'round in the V-12 with the racks in the middle
I was ridin' 'round in the V-12 with the racks in the middle
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ay

I was riding 'round in the V-12 with the racks in the middle
Had to pray to almighty God they let my dog out the kennel
When you get it straight up out the mud, you can't imagine this shit
I been pullin' up in the drop tops with the baddest bitches
Young nigga been focused on my check (Mhmmhm)
Got a new coupe wrapped around my neck (Mhmmhm)
Tryna put the water on my Patek (Mhmmhm)
I got killers to the left of me (Mhmmhm)


We was lurking on 'em, ain't show no mercy on 'em
We was goin' back to back, we put a curfew on 'em
It was dark clouds on us, but that was perfect for us
We know you always crash and burn, but it was working for us
Limo tint the V-12, double check the details
Gotta cross my T's and dot my I's or I can't sleep well
Millions off of retail
Once again, I prevail
Knew that shit was over from the day I dropped my pre-sale
Hold up, let the beat build
See me in the streets still
I been fightin' battles up a steep hill
They gave my road dog twelve, it was a sweet deal
And I been ridin' solo tryna rebuild
Look


I was riding 'round in the V-12 with the racks in the middle
Had to pray to almighty God they let my dog out the kennel
When you get it straight up out the mud, you can't imagine this shit
I been pullin' up in the drop tops with the baddest bitches
Young nigga been focused on my check (Mhmmhm)
Got a new coupe wrapped around my neck (Mhmmhm)
Tryna put the water on my Patek (Mhmmhm)
I got killers to the left of me (Mhmmhm)


Look, under no condition would you ever catch me slippin'
Motorcaded shooters plus the Maybach chauffeur-driven
If they catch me wit' it, gon' send me off to prison
Judge ain't sympathizin', court don't show forgiveness
Engine in the Lambo drownin' out the music
Silk Dior with the flowers, five gold Cubans
Champagne while I shop, hope I splurge foolish
Closin' Escrow twice this month, both commercial units
Damn, I wish my nigga Fatts was here
How you die thirty somethin' after banging all them years?
Grammy-nominated, in the sauna sheddin' tears
All this money, power, fame and I can't make you reappear
But I don't wipe 'em though
We just embrace the only life we know
If it was me, I would tell you, "Nigga, live your life and grow"
I'd tell you, "Finish what we started, reach them heights. You know?
And gas the V-12 'til the pipe in smoke."


I was ridin' 'round in the V-12 with the racks in the middle

Another million dollar bail, that's just some regular shit
See my granny on a jet, some shit I'll never forget
Next day we flew to Vegas, with my Puma connects
We break bread, we ain't new to success
Bleed music, invest, enterprise, take lucrative steps
Cold game, but I knew it was Chess
As a youth in the set
Learn the game, you a student at best
But it's a couple things you can expect
Look, just like money know money, nigga, shooters respect
Other shooters we was both, don't want my crew on your neck
I'm on the freeway in a drop, it got me losing my breath
I do the dash with the blues on the deck
---------------------------------------------------
Everything's been so messed up here lately
Pretty sure he don't wanna be my baby
Oh, he don't love me, he don't love me, he don't love me, he don't love me

I'm obsessed, I'm embarrassed
I don't trust no one around us
I'm a mess for your love, it ain't new

Nobody shows up unless I'm paying
Have a drink on me, cheers to the failing
Oh, he don't love me, he don't love me
He don't love me, he don't love me
But that's okay
'Cause I love me, yeah, I love me

It's gonna be a good, good life

I'm a mess, I'm a loser
I'm a hater, I'm a user
I'm a mess for your love, it ain't new
I'm obsessed (I'm obsessed), I'm embarrassed
I don't trust no one around us
I'm a mess for your love, it ain't new (yeah)

Fonsi (¡Ay!)

Eso que te falta cuando estas con el
Que te mire y que te haga sentir mujer
No te mientas que el nunca te hara el amor
Como yo, como yo (Ozuna)
Guarda tu secreto aqui en el corazon
De cuando mi boca se perdio en tu piel (wuh)
No hay que serle fiel cuando ya no hay amor, no hay amor

Es imposible que te quiera como yo (no)
No hay nadie que te quiera como yo (como yo)
Dejame que te cambie la suerte
Es imposible que te bese como yo (no)
No hay nadie que te bese como yo (como-como yo)
Para mi es imposible perderte

Y asi, na' ma', me enamore, eh-eh-eh-eh
De esa carita que no tiene nadie
Bailando aqui en el medio de la calle (ah)
Y asi (ah), na' ma' (ah), me enamoro, oh-oh-oh-oh
Quisiera que esta noche no se acabe
Es imposible que te quiera como yo (baby, como-como)

Ozuna (jaja)
Te juro, nadie va a quererte como yo lo hago
Dios mio que me perdone, pero si es pecado
Solamente quiero morir a tu lado
Y hacerte sentir to' lo que te hacia (ouh)
Jure que aquel dia, nunca olvidaria, me dijiste que volvia'
Pero yo me lo crei, sin saber que tu sabia'
Pero te volvi a tener, la vida es una ironia (oh-oh)
To' lo que te hacia
Jure que aquel dia (oh-oh-oh), nunca olvidaria, me dijiste que volvia'
Pero yo me lo crei, sin saber que tu sabia' (uoh-oh, uoh-oh)
Pero te volvi a tener, la vida es una ironia (uoh-oh-oh)

Es imposible que te quiera como yo (como yo)
No hay nadie que te quiera como yo (como yo)
Dejame que te cambie la suerte (eh-eh)
Es imposible que te bese como yo (ouh-ouh)
No hay nadie que te bese como yo (como-como yo)
Para mi es imposible perderte

Y asi, na' ma' (ah), me enamore, eh-eh-eh-eh (oh)
De esa carita que no tiene nadie
Bailando aqui en el medio de la calle (no-no)
Y asi (ah), na' ma' (ah), me enamoro, oh-oh-oh-oh
Quisiera que esta noche no se acabe
Es imposible que te quiera como yo

Ey (jajaja), bailalo, bailalo
Fonsi
Eh-eh-eh-eh
Ozuna
B.A
Oh no, oh no
Dimelo Vi
Oh-oh-uoh-uoh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, baby
Quisiera que esta noche no se acabe
Es imposible que te quiera como yo

Work all day, work all night
Might not get no sleep tonight
Baby can you stay up?
We could talk, we could dance
Don't matter the circumstance
We don't let it change us

That's the beautiful thing about us
'Fore all the diamonds and rings, we got trust
Roll with me, get it right, faded on a summer night
Let's see where it takes us

I got real big plans baby, for you and me
So love me for who I am and for who I'm gonna be
Ain't got everything you want but got everything you need
So take a chance, take a chance on me

I got real big plans
Hold up, hold up baby

Know you're tired, know you're down
Know you wanna leave this town
Baby give me one year, yeah
Take my hand, take a leap
Girl, you gotta wait and see
Where I take it from here

That's the beautiful thing about you
I know that you'd do the same in my shoes
Never switch, never stop
I could see us at the top
Girl why don't we go there

I got real big plans baby, for you and me
So love me for who I am and for who I'm gonna be
Ain't got everything you want but got everything you need

Buongiorno, buonasera a los signori y las principessa
Non capito l'italiani, l'italiano de la zona
Il bambino Don Patricio e Cruzzi Cafunotti
De la piazza de la Caleta para el mundo entero
Pizza prosciutto, pizza tropicale, pan con ajo 2'50 Coca Cola grande
Espero que disfruten del disco de Patri

Vente, vacila un poquito
Que aunque yo me haga el loquito
Me encanta y lo sabe'
Y si esta loca, loquita mia
Yo se quien eres realmente
Y no lo que ellos saben

Esa mami me tiene loco
Ya casi no cojo playa contando lunares
Ahora vente donde tu ya sabe'
La verdad que conocerte no entraba en mis planes

Mira, aquel dia se armo un fuerte pitote
To's en la caleta, botaos', ¿no? Suponte
Todos resacosos, que esa noche fue de lote
Y pa' recuperar pa'l charco con el sol en el cogote
Estabamos con Kuko y con el Viti, tranquilotes
Y de pronto de la nada aparece un fuerte perote
Que entra por ahi tirandonos besos
Me giro pa'l nota y digo, "Patri, ¿y eso?"
Te lo juro, no se como explicarlo
Era de fuera de La Restinga o algo
Era preciosa y quedona, vio que la mirabamos
Que se tiro de piloto adrede pa' salpicarnos
Y cuando salio del agua (Ay papa)
Todos supercantosos en plan (Ay papa)
Nos acercamos a hablar en plan, a ver que surge
Y nos suelta, "No, sobran, si yo vine con Uge"

Vente, vacila un poquito
Que aunque yo me haga el loquito
Me encanta y lo sabe'
Y si esta loca, loquita mia
Yo se quien eres realmente
Y no lo que ellos saben

Don Patricio mami, bailame el venao'
Juega con los tazos y el bollicao
Yo la pienso mucho, ella me tiene loquito
Pero dile a esa jevita que no estoy casao'
Tu ropa en mi cuarto desordenao'
Deja ya a ese guacho guaton culieao'
Hace ya un verano que no te damos verano
Pero el dia del concierto esta sold out
Papas arrugadas, mojito, pescao'
Hazte una fontana, chiquito tumbao'
Yo vine a buscarte pero, ¿mami que tienes?
Mami, si te lo pongo dedicao'
Pura crema, arroz con habichuela
Dejate de especias, mami vamo' al grano
Y dile que bailando te conoci
Y nos lo gozamos

Pa' dentro carajo
Tengo buena espina
Comiendome un gajo
Pura vitamina
No encuentro trabajo
No quiero otra vida
Poquito pa' abajo
Poquito pa' arriba

Pa' dentro carajo
Tengo buena espina
Comiendome un gajo
Pura vitamina
No encuentro trabajo
No quiero otra vida
Poquito pa' abajo
Poquito pa' arriba

Vente, vacila un poquito
Que aunque yo me haga el loquito
Me encanta y lo sabe'
Y si esta loca, loquita mia
Yo se quien eres realmente
Y no lo que ellos saben

Esa mami me tiene loco
Ya casi no cojo playa contando lunares
Ahora vente donde tu ya sabe'
La verdad que conocerte no entraba en mis planes

No aguanto mas un segundo sin verte
Responde ya, que esto es de vida o muerte
Ya me conoces, nunca fui tan fuerte
Tu dejaste nuestro amor en el olvido
Esta relacion en puntos suspensivos
Dime si valio la pena, dime si valio la pena

Pasaran mas de mil anos y yo no te olvido
No me lo pidas, no sere tu amigo
Estar contigo es mi destino
Pasaran mas de mil anos y yo no te olvido
No me lo pidas, no sere tu amigo
No aceptare los puntos suspensivos

Entregarte tanto fue mi debilidad
Y tus besos ahora son mi necesidad
Ahora solo me acompana la soledad
Contigo siento que yo pierdo mi dignidad (yeah)
Tuyo, si es que no te tengo y yo me siento tuyo
Y aun asi yo me sigo preguntando
Si yo no fui lo suficiente para ti
No fui lo suficiente para ti
Tuyo, si es que no te tengo y yo me siento tuyo
Y aun asi yo me sigo preguntando
Si yo no fui lo suficiente para ti

Pasaran mas de mil anos y yo no te olvido
No me lo pidas, no sere tu amigo
Estar contigo es mi destino
Pasaran mas de mil anos y yo no te olvido
No me lo pidas, no sere tu amigo
No aceptare los puntos suspensivos

Tu dejaste nuestro amor en el olvido
Esta relacion en puntos suspensivos
Dime si valio la pena, dime si valio la pena
No aguanto mas un segundo sin verte
Responde ya, que esto es de vida o muerte
Ya me conoces, nunca fui tan fuerte

Pasaran mas de mil anos y yo no te olvido
No me lo pidas, no sere tu amigo
Estar contigo es mi destino
Pasaran mas de mil anos y yo no te olvido
No me lo pidas, no sere tu amigo
No aceptare los puntos suspensivos

Haven't let that thing loose, girl, in so long
You've been inside, know you like to lay low
I've been peepin' what you bringin' to the table
Workin' hard, girl, everything paid for

Hoes talk down, you don't see 'em outside
Yeah, they don't really be the same off-line
You know dark days, you know hard times
Doin' overtime for the last month
Saturday, call the girls, get 'em gassed up
Gotta hit the club, gotta make that ass jump
Gotta hit the club like you hit them motherfuckin' angles
With your phone out, snappin' like you Fabo
And you showin' off, but it's alright
And you showin' off, but it's alright (Alright!)
It's a short life

Uh-huh! (Oh yeah!)

---------------------------------------------------
I know you moved onto someone new
Hope life is beautiful
You were the light for me to find my truth
I just wanna say, thank you


Leaving to find my soul
Told her I had to go
And I know it ain't pretty
When our hearts get broke
Too young to feel this old
Watching us both turn cold
Oh, I know it ain't pretty
When two hearts get broke
Yeah, I know it ain't pretty
When two hearts get broke


I hope someday
We'll sit down together
And laugh with each other
About these days, these days
All our troubles
We'll lay to rest
And we'll wish we could come back to these days
These days
These days, these days
These days, these days


Three years of ups and downs
Nothing to show for it now
And I know it ain't pretty when the fire burns out
Calling me when I'm drunk
Remind me of what I've done
And I know it ain't pretty when you're trying to move on, yeah

I hope someday
We'll sit down together
And laugh with each other
About these days, these days
All our troubles
We'll lay to rest
And we'll wish we could come back to these days, these days

Oh I know, I know
Oh I know, I know
Oh I know, I know
These days, these days
Oh I know, I know
Oh I know, I know
Oh I know, I know
To these days, these days


Cigarettes in the ashtray
Reminiscing on those past days
I thought you'd end up with my last name
But that changed
And I traveled around the world
Think where you living at now?
I heard you moved to Austin
Got an apartment and settled down
And every once in a while
I start texting
Write a paragraph
But then I delete the message
Think about you like a past time
I could cry you a river
Get you baptised or
I wasn't ready to act right
Used to always think I'd get you back, right
They say that things fall apart
We were gonna move to Brooklyn
You were gonna study Art
Love is just a tool
To remind us who we are
And that we are not alone
And we're walking in the dark


I hope someday
We'll sit down together
And laugh with each other
About these days, these days
All our troubles
We'll lay to rest
And we'll wish we could come back to these days, these days
We'll wish we could come back to these days, these days
---------------------------------------------------
Yeah

Wheezy out of here


The dash, it's digital, the schedule busy
My head in a hoodie, my shorty a goodie
My cousins are crazy, my cousins like Boogie
Life is amazin', it is what it should be
Been here for ten but I feel like a rookie
I tell her, "look up" 'cause it's snowin' in Tootsie's
Booked for three years, man you can't even book me
It's me and Lil Baby, this shit goin' crazy
Wheezy produced it and Weezy F. made me
And she held it down, so she got a Mercedes
Young Money Records, the Army, the Navy
They ran me ten thousand, I threw it like Brady
The foreign is yellow like Tracee and K.D
I trusted my niggas, they never betrayed me
Met all these niggas, they sweeter than Sadie
When I started out, I just took what they gave me
Did all the favors, they never repaid me
It worked in my favor, 'cause nobody saved me


Brand new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like yes indeed

Cartier glasses, I won't even peek at you
Yellow Ferrari like Pikachu
I got 'em waitin' and watchin' what he gon' do
Tryna peep what I do, tryna steal my moves
25 hundred for a new pair of tennis shoes
The same price, I could make them youngins come and finish you
Lawyer been chargin', he a Jewish like he voodoo
Real dope boy, hundred thousand in Evisu
Presidential tints slide by, we don't see you
I been gettin' money, I ain't worried 'bout what he do
I'm gettin' money like I'm from the '80s
Me and Drake 'bout to drop man, this shit gon' go crazy
They know I'm the truth, comin' straight from the basement
I'm straight as the street, man I come from the pavement
A million, all hundreds, it make em 'go crazy
Wah-wah-wah, bitch, I'm the Baby

Brand new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like yes indeed
Me and my dawg goin' all the way
When you livin' like this, they supposed to hate
Brand new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like yes indeed
Me and my dawg goin' all the way
When you livin' like this, they supposed to hate


Wheezy out of here
---------------------------------------------------
Talking to yourself, you'll make believe
Filling up a void eight days a week
Wanna get to know you
Wanna get to know you

At the diner
You looked finer than a set of china that my mama don't use
I looked helpless, you looked selfish
But you liked Elvis so I thought you were cool

I like honesty and self respect
But you spell rent "P-A-R-E-N-T-S"

Talking to yourself, you'll make believe
Filling up a void eight days a week
Wanna get to know you
Wanna get to know you
We could make some plans, tell me you're free
Aren't you getting tired of woe is me
Trying to get to know you
Trying to get to know you

Always talking, so deflated
You make plans but you never come through
You say you're busy, but you miss me
I'll here waiting around like a fool

I've got patience and persistance
You spell love "F-R-I-E-N-D-S"

Talking to yourself, you'll make believe
Filling up a void eight days a week
Wanna get to know you
Wanna get to know you
We could make some plans, tell me you're free
Aren't you getting tired of woe is me
Trying to get to know you
Trying to get to know you

Girl, you know I'd give the world to you
But you can't even open up to me
Played my part on your TV screen
Your made up movie, make believe
All I wanted was to see what happened
And you're still

Talking to yourself, you'll make believe
Filling up a void eight days a week
Wanna get to know you
Wanna get to know you
We could make some plans, tell me you're free
Aren't you getting tired of woe is me
Trying to get to know you
Trying to get to know you

Te presto mis ojos para que veas lo hermosa que eres, mm, mm
Te presto mis manos para que toques las nubes si quieres
Te presto mis dedos para que recuerdes
Todo lo que hicimos esa noche del viernes
Te presto mis besos, y me los devuelves
Asi tengo una excusa para volver a verte

Yo no te pido que te enamores
Seamos eternos solo esta noche
Yo no te pido que seamos novios
Si siendo amigos ya nos damos de todo

Amigos con derecho
Y todos tus despechos
Te los quitas conmigo como nadie lo habia hecho
Amigos con derecho
Que sea nuestro secreto
Que solo las paredes sean testigos de lo nuestro

(Hey lady, escucha como nos conocimos, jaja, venga)
Eran las 8:15 en la plaza de San Juan
Ibas caminando con par de amigas mas

Matame con esa boquita embriagame (embriagame)
Con tu cuerpo ven seduceme
Quitemonos ya la ropa que asi desnuda te ves mas sexy
Para mi tu eres mi lady
Yo soy tu Maluma, baby (jajaja)
Amigos con derecho, tu buen provecho (jaja, muah)

Seamos eternos solo esta noche
Yo no te pido que seamos novios
Si siendo amigos ya nos damos de todo

Yeah, I done did a lot of things in my day, I admit it
I don't take back what I say, if I said it then I meant it
All my life I want a Grammy, but I'll prolly never get it
I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon (Yah I said it)
Fuck the system, I'm that nigga, bend the law, cut the rules
I'm about to risk it all, I ain't got too much to lose
Y'all been eatin' long enough, it's my turn to cut the food
Pass the plate! Where my drink? This my day, lucky you
Fuck you too, woo!

Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice

Back on my bullshit, my back to the wall
Turn my back on you, all of you finished
Back to these bullets, it's back to the job
Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin'
Back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushin'
These packs and I'm actually pumpin'
Can't fuck with you rappers, you practically suckin'
You mighta went platinum but that don't mean nothin'
I'm actually buzzin' this time
Straight out the kitchen, I told 'em the oven is mine
I do not fuck with you guys
If I don't kill you, just know you gon' suffer this time
I ain't no gangster but I got some bangers
Some chains and some blades and a couple of nines
Choppers and jammies, a partridge, a pear tree
My twelve days of Christmas was nothin' but lies
I run at you hard like a sumo (Sumo)
They say I talk like a chulo (Chulo)
I live in Mars, I'm not Bruno (Woo)
Bitch I'm a dog, call me Cujo (Rah)
You play your cards, I reverse on you all
And I might just draw 4 like a Uno (Bup)
Callate boca mejor, maricon, little puto, and all of you culo (Joyner)
They've invented a level up in the ghetto to get old
Lookin' for somethin' I prolly can never find now
Shit get relevant 'til 'nother beef die down
In truth a nigga just really want me tied down
I've been alone and I never needed nobody
Just only me and my shotty, I'll tell these niggas to lie down
Keep all the money, I never wanted the lifestyle
I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now
I said ain't no love for the other side
Or anyone who ever want smoke (Joyner)
When I die I'm goin' out as a underdog who never lost hope (Yeah)
You in the wrong cab down the wrong path
Nigga, wrong way, wrong road (Woo, woo)
Snakes in the grass tryna slither fast
I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower (Vroom!)


I done said a lotta things in my day, I admit it
This is payback in a way, I regret it that I did it
I done won a couple Grammys, but I sold my soul to get 'em
Wasn't in it for the trophies, just the fuckin' recognition
Fuck's the difference?
I'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules
Man I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose
I've been eatin' long enough, man my stomach should be full
I just ate, licked the plate, my buffet, lucky me
Fuck you think? (Woo!)

I got a couple of mansions
Still I don't have any manners
You got a couple of ghost writers
But to these kids it don't actually matter
They're askin' me, "What the fuck happened to hip-hop?"
I said, "I don't have any answers."
'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
It hurt me like hell but I'm back on these rappers
And actually comin' from humble beginnings
I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say, "What a wonderful feeling!"
"We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling!"
But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability
To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me
The inability to pen humility
Ha-ta-ta ba-ta-ta, why don't we make a bunch of
Fuckin' songs about nothin' and mumble 'em?
Fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular
Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
About the ones that were here before you that made rap
Let's recap, way back, MC's that wreak havoc on tape decks
ADAT's, where the G Raps and Kanes at?
We need 3 Stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back
'Cause half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
I don't hate trap, and I don't wanna seem mad
But in fact, where the old me at? The same cat
That would take that feedback and aim back, I need that
But I think it's inevitable
They know what button to press or what lever to pull
To get me to snap though (Lil' bitch)
And if I pay it attention I'm prob'ly makin' it bigger
But you've been takin' the dicks in the fuckin' back, ho (Get it?)
On the brink, any minute got me thinkin' of finishin'
Everything with acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits
I'm asleep at the wheel again
As I peak into thinkin' about an evil intent
Of another beat I'ma kill again
'Cause even if I gotta end up eatin' a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
It better be at least 70 to 300 milligram
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
Levels to this shit, I got an elevator
You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater
Motherfucker, now I got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA
But I wrote 'til the wheels fall off, I'm workin' tirelessly, ayy
It's the moment y'all been waitin' for
Like California wishin' rain to pour
In that drought, y'all been prayin' for
My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
Still the same Marshall, that outlaw
That they say as a writer might've fell off
I'm back on that bull like the cowboy

So y'all gotta move (yeah), y'all gotta move (yeah)

Y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice
---------------------------------------------------
They're rotting my brain, love
These hoes are the same

I admit it, another hoe got me finished
Broke my heart, oh no you didn't
Fuck sippin', I'mma down a whole bottle
Hard liquor, hard truth can't swallow
Need a bartender, put me out my sorrow
Wake up the next day in the Monte Carlo
With a new woman
Tell me she from Colorado
And she love women
She'll be gone by tomorrow
Who am I kiddin'
All this jealousy and agony that I sit in
I'm a jealous boy, really feel like John Lennon
I just want real love, guess it's been a minute
Pissed off from the way that I don't fit in, I don't fit in
Tell me what's the secret to love, I don't get it
Feel like I be runnin' a race I'm not winnin'
Ran into the devil today and she grinnin'

Hey, these girls are insane
All girls are the same
They're rotting my brain, love
Think I need a change
Before I go insane, love
All girls are the same
They're rotting my brain, love
Think I need a change
Before I go insane, love

Ten minutes, she told me it would take ten minutes
To break my heart, oh no she didn't
Fuck living, Imma drown in my sorrow
Fuck giving, Imma take not borrow
And I'm still sinnin'
I'm still losing my mind
I know I been trippin'
I'm still wasting my time
All the time given, am I dying, am I living
It's fuck feelin's, my sorrow go up to the ceilin'

Now I am insane
Demons in my brain, love
Peace I can't obtain
Cause all these girls the same, love
Now I am insane
Demons in my brain, love
Peace I can't obtain
Cause all these girls the same, love
---------------------------------------------------

Once I touch down, I go deep like a running back
Just jumped on the private jet and rolled a joint
Played the beat then wrote that joint
Wrote a whole movie, then I sold that joint
Fuck Illuminati, that boy 6ix got my back

You got on repeat, word on the street

That boy got the sauce on the RAGU-lar
I don't play no games 'less we talkin' Fortnite
Finally knew I made it, sittin' at the red light
When them soccer moms pull up in they van while I ride

But my door's suicide, yeah, I'm too alive
Bitch, I have arrived, everybody know I'm one hell of a guy

Haters that never made it, I'm living the dream for ya
Roll up, grab the kush and then roll up
Hold up, better give me what I want when I show up
You know what I do, not who coming through
How 'bout you?
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, you're cool
I don't fuck with nobody like mean girls in high school
I don't give a damn that I'm famous
Why it seem like every single celebrity shameless, it's dangerous
Got fifty million but my swag on food stamps
All these models poppin' bottles, bitch, I ain't tryna dance
She said, "No, I don't wanna pay my bills"
I need a hard working woman with respect who will
This for everybody who ain't made it yet
Got five degrees and six figures in debt
Follow your dreams ho, follow your— follow your—, uh
Somebody calling your, uh, it's destiny
Hold up with the turn up for a second man, who's testing me?
I got so much power, don't know why the heavens blessing me
PLP, I think that is the recipe
So I'ma take a moment, use my power for good
Fuck the bullshit, do what you love and get out the hood

I ain't nothin' but the ashes on your cigarette
To the ground, to the ground, lay me down, you make me upset
Good at pushin' me away, swear that you're the best
I wear my heart on my sleeve, yeah, yours' deep in your chest

I don't do this for me, I do this for you
Always wonderin' why I got involved
You were never there when I'm feelin' low
And now I just don't know what the fuck to do

Got more fried and we fight from mornin' to night
When we were feelin' all right, girl, do we shine
But now emotions gone cold and you don't love me no more
Yeah, all the truths they unfold between you and I
So I'm saying goodbye

Say I ain't nothin' but the feelin' from that bottle
You feelin' numb sometimes, the truth is hard to swallow (Yeah)
And when we fight you always tellin' me don't come around
I admit I'm fallin' for you even though I'm down and out
Knock me off my pedestal then grind it down a level
Ever since you left I swear my mind been so unsettled
Like, 'Are we still together, or are you feelin' fed up? '
Yeah, I used to be a dog, on the real you make me better

Got more fried and we fight from mornin' to night
When we were feelin' all right, girl, do we shine
But now emotions gone cold and you don't love me no more
Yeah, all the truths they unfold between you and I
So I'm saying goodbye

You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it (I love it)
You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it (I love it)

They had to fake orgasms and shit
We can tell niggas today: "Hey, I wanna cum, mothafucka"

You touch me and it's almost like we knew
That there will be history between us two
We knew someday that we would have regrets
But we just ignored them the night we met
We just dance backwards into each other
Trying to keep our feelings secretly covered
You touch me and it's almost like we knew
That there will be history

There's no way that it's not going there
With the way that were looking at each other
There's no way that it's not going there
Every second with you I want another
But maybe we can hold off one sec
So we can keep this tension in check
But there's no way that it's not going there
With the way that were looking at each other

I wish I could make the time stop
So we could forget everything and everyone
I wish that the time would line up
So we could just give in to what we want
'Cause when I got somebody, you don't
And when you got somebody, I don't
I wish that the time would line up
So we could just give in

There's no way that it's not going there
With the way that were looking at each other
There's no way that it's not going there
Every second with you I want another
But maybe we can hold off one sec
So we can keep this tension in check
But there's no way that it's not going there
With the way that were looking at each other

We just dance backwards into each other
Trying to keep our feelings secretly covered
We just dance backwards into each other
Trying to keep our feelings secretly covered
You touched me and it's almost like we knew
That there would be history

There's no way that it's not going there
With the way that were looking at each other
There's no way that it's not going there
Every second with you I want another
But maybe we can hold off one sec
So we can keep this tension in check
But there's no way that it's not going there
With the way that were looking at each other

We just keep on dancing right into each other
We just keep on dancing right into each other
---------------------------------------------------
Ah, ah
I'm the boy in your other phone
Lighting up inside your drawer at home all alone
Pushing forty in the friend zone
We talk and then you walk away every day

Ooh, you don't think twice 'bout me
And maybe you're right to doubt me, but

But if you give me just one night
You're gonna see me in a new light
Yeah, if you give me just one night
To meet you underneath the moonlight

Oh, I wanna take two, I wanna break through
I wanna know the real thing about you
So I can see you in a new light

Take a ride up to Malibu
I just wanna sit and look at you, look at you
What would it matter if your friends knew?
Who cares what other people say anyway?

Oh, we can go far from here
And make a new world together, babe

'Cause if you give me just one night
You're gonna see me in a new light
Yeah, if you give me just one night
To meet you underneath the moonlight

Oh, I wanna take two, I wanna break through
I wanna know the real thing about you
So I can see you in a new light

Ay, ay
Ay, ay
Ay, ay
Ay, ay
Ay, ay

Ah

Yeah, if you give me just one night
You're gonna see me in a new light
Yeah, if you give me just one night
To meet you underneath the moonlight

What do I do with all this, what do I do with all this
Love that's running through my veins for you?
What do I do with all this, what do I do with all this
Love that's running through my veins for you?

What do I do with all this, what do I do with all this
Love that's running through my veins for you?
What do I do with all this, what do I do with all this, ooh

Three nights at the motel
Under streetlights
In the city of palms
Call me what you want, when you want, if you want
And you can call me names if you call me up
Three nights at the motel
Under streetlights
In the city of palms
Call me what you want, when you want, if you want
And you can call me names if you call me up

Feel like the least of all your problems
You can reach me if you wanna
Stay up tonight
Stay up at night
Green lights in your body language
Seems like you could use a little
Company from me
But if you got everything
Figured out like you say
Don't waste a minute
Don't wait a minute
It's only a matter of time
For you (ou), to (oo)
Tell me now
Cause I've been up for
I've been up for

Three nights at the motel
Under streetlights
In the city of palms
Call me what you want, when you want, if you want (want)
And you can call me names if you call me up (call me up)
Three nights at the motel
Under streetlights
In the city of palms
Call me what you want, when you want, if you want
And you can call me names if you call me up
(Ooh)

I can't fix each and all your problems
I'm no good with names and faces
She sent me naked pictures
From her neck down to the waist
I get my feelings involved
She stopped returnin' my calls
Flaws turned into walls and barricades
And I'm too far gone in all the wrong ways
And now every long day is a bad one
I can't make you call or make you stay
Or take you off the pedestal
So I get lost in modern music watchin' movies
Talkin' to the walls in my room
Walkin' through the halls in my head
Just tryna make sure it all makes sense
I ain't made of money
Maybe someday you could take it from me
I'm up too late
Thinkin' bout you
And M.I.A for

Three nights at the motel
Under streetlights
In the city of palms
Call me what you want, when you want, if you want (want)
And you can call me names if you call me up (call me up)
Three nights at the motel
Under streetlights
In the city of palms
Call me what you want, when you want, if you want
And you can call me names if you call me up

Los asesinos
Wo-oh-oh, brr
Real Hasta la Muerte, baby
¡Este es el remix!
Uah


Mi mente malda' (Si-si)
Bebo pa' recordarte
Y tu que me llamas
Pa' que pase a buscarte
Quiero darte (Eso e' asi, eso e' asi)
Como la ultima vez que lo hicimo', mami
Quiero darte (The Real Rondon)
Yo quiero darte, bebe, quiero darte, bebe, eh
(Brytiago)


No vo' a negarte que bien dura te ve' (Eso e' asi)
Puede ser que borracho un dia vuelva y te de (Pa' que sepa')
Ojala y terminemo' como la ultima ve' (Por ley)
Que sea quien te enamore y que no me vuelva' a ver


(The Big Boss, fuego)
Asesina, yo se que tu eres mala
Por eso, traje chaleco antibala'
Chambeaste en el asalto y terminaste en mi cuarto
Porque al final, conmigo, te resbala'
Tu te haces la loca, loca, inteligente
Como me conoce', juega con mi mente
To' el mundo es loco hasta que tiene otro de frente
De nacimiento, una demente
Dale, ponte suci, pon la nalga' en el suelo
Vamo' pa' un entierro, pero no te velo
Yo soy como el Lambo, te zumbo el veneno
Mami, yo te piso y te aplico el freno
Sicaria, tu no-tu no va' a cambiar
A ti te gusta el peligro, y asi te va' a quedar


(It's The Real Rondon, ra-ta-ta-ta)
Tu eres un problema serio (¡Ja!)
Porque no tienes corazon, ya esta muerto en el cementerio (eso e' asi)
No le hagas caso a los intermedios
Que se salgan del medio
Sin condon contigo me voy a criterio
Cuando estamos junto', mami, todo es bello
Tu sabes que no ronco mucho, pero tengo mas que ellos (¡Ja-ja!)
Desenmona tu, que el phillie yo lo sello
Cuando suba la nota, ponte en cuatro en lo que yo te estrello
(Real G4 Life, my nigga)
Ese tipo te tiene aborrecia (Aborrecia)
Tu dices que estas confundi'a (Confundi'a)
Te pelea 'e noche y te pelea 'e dia
Pero tu ere' masoquista porque sigue' ahi meti'a (Ahi meti'a)
Yo te vo'a dar duro por creci'a (Por creci'a)
Te vo'a jalar tu pelo por lucia (Por lucia)
Pegate pa' darte una barri'a
Y cuando llegue el otro dia me va' a decir na' perdi'a


No vo' a negarte que bien dura te ve' (Eso e' asi)
Puede ser que borracho un dia vuelva y te de (Pa' que sepa')

Ojala y terminemo' como la ultima ve' (Por ley)
Que sea quien te enamore y que no me vuelva' a ver


Anuel (Uah)
Tu eres una diabla, y yo soy un demonio
Y yo amo a tu totito, pero a ti te odio
Hija del diablo, odia el matrimonio
Pero tu amiga a mi bicho custodio
Y no me arrepenti
Ya no tengo bicho pa' ti
Y en el cuello ahora tengo cien mil
Bebe, te bote y de ti me olvide (Uah)
Y tengo cien putas, no son veintitres (Jaja)
Dios mio, perdon
Pero pa' mi, ella se murio (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Ella me fallo
Y viro, pero ya se jodio (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Los kilo' en el jet
Gaste cien mil en el Porsche
Bebe, Louis Vuitton en mis pies
Mala mujer, no te lo vo'a volver a meter

No vo' a negarte que bien rica te ve', eh-eh
Yo se que ni borracho yo te meto otra ve' (Eh-eh)
Y ya yo ni me acuerdo de la ultima ve'
Y te lo juro por mi vida, no te vuelvo a romper, eh-eh


(Brytiago)
Maliciosa, siempre tiene lo que quiere
Solo me busca' cada vez que te conviene
Se pone dificil, su orgullo no hay quien lo frene
Por mas que brinque' y salte', baby, aqui tu muere'
Y ahora estas bien suelta
Dos tragos y me pongo pa' la vuelta
Pa' hacer un pacto el diablo me tienta
Jugando con mi mente eres experta
Entre esa' piernas tu tiene' poderes
Por eso sigo aqui aunque pelees
Decirte que no, desnu'a no se puede
No voy a negar que la clave la tiene'
Pero peleando, estas cincuenta y cero a lo Mayweather


Ojala se repita
Yo quiero una, una proba'ita
Recordemo', bebecita
Como en la guagua mis cancione' tu las gritas
Como de kryptonita
Y ese bootysote que amerita
(Ma'-ma') No puedo olvidar tu forma 'e besar
Como te comia y el llamandote pa' pelear
Ahora, si quieres, nos vamo' en jet para asegurar
Tranquila, que ese se muere como diga que te va a tocar
Yo lo se, bebe
Recordemos como es que lo haciamo'
Pero no olvidemo' como nos comiamo', bebe


No vo' a negarte que bien dura te ve', eh-eh
Yo se que ni borracho yo te meto otra ve' (Pa' que sepa')

Ojala y terminemo' como la ultima ve'
Y te lo juro por mi vida, no te vuelvo a romper, eh-eh

When I'm around slow dancing in the dark
Don't follow me, you'll end up in my arms
You done made up your mind
I don't need no more signs
Can you?
Can you?

Give me reasons we should be complete
You should be with him, I can't compete
You looked at me like I was someone else, oh well
Can't you see?
I don't wanna slow dance
In the dark, dark

When you gotta run
Just hear my voice in you (My voice in you)
Shutting me out of you (shutting me out of you)
Doing so great (So great, so great)
You

Used to be the one to hold you when you fall
Yeah, yeah, yeah (When you fall, when you fall)
I don't fuck with your tone (I don't fuck with your tone)
I don't wanna go home (I don't wanna go home)
Can it be one night?
Can you?
Can you?

Give me reasons we should be complete
You should be with him, I can't compete
You looked at me like I was someone else, oh well
Can't you see?
I don't wanna slow dance (I don't wanna slow dance)
In the dark, dark
In the dark, dark
---------------------------------------------------
My mother said I'm too romantic
She said, "You're dancing in the movies."
I almost started to believe her
Then I saw you and I knew

Maybe it's 'cause I got a little bit older
Maybe it's all that I've been through
I'd like to think it's how you lean on my shoulder
And how I see myself with you

I don't say a word
But still, you take my breath and steal the things I know
There you go, saving me from out of the cold

Fire on fire, would normally kill us
With this much desire, together, we're winners
They say that we're out of control and some say we're sinners
But don't let them ruin our beautiful rhythms
'Cause when you unfold me and tell me you love me
And look in my eye
You are perfection, my only direction
It's fire on fire, mmm
It's fire on fire

When we fight, we fight like lions
But then we love and feel the truth
We lose our minds in a city of roses
We won't abide by any rules

I don't say a word
But still, you take my breath and steal the things I know
There you go, saving me from out of the cold

Fire on fire, would normally kill us
With this much desire, together, we're winners
They say that we're out of control and some say we're sinners
But don't let them ruin our beautiful rhythms
'Cause when you unfold me and tell me you love me
And look in my eye
You are perfection, my only direction
It's fire on fire, oh
It's fire on fire

Fire on fire, would normally kill us
With this much desire, together, we're winners
They say that we're out of control and some say we're sinners
But don't let them ruin our beautiful rhythms

Fire on fire, would normally kill us
With this much desire, together, we're winners
They say that we're out of control and some say we're sinners
But don't let them ruin our beautiful rhythms
'Cause when you unfold me and tell me you love me
And look in my eye
You are perfection, my only direction
It's fire on fire

You are perfection, my only direction
It's fire on fire

Forever alone
O-O-Ovy On The Drums
Forever alone

Sigo pensando en que le puedo contestar
Cuando me preguntan de como soy en realidad
Pasa que a eso nunca lo habia analizao'
Sin conocerme tanto le' puedo contar que soy

Chico tranquilo, sin nada para opinar
Siempre en lo mio, tal vez soy egoista
Pocos amigo' pero mucha historia pa' contar
Un reservado, loco, timido, pero pegao' (Aah-ah)
Alguno' dicen si, otro' dicen que no (Aah-ah)
Y la buena pa' ti, tambien la buena pa' vo' (Ah, ah, ah)
Yo solo sigo aqui, sentadito en el sillon (Ah, ah, ah, yeh)
Siendo un chico aburrido, perezoso y dormilon (Ah, ah, ah)
Ah-uoh-uoh, perezoso y dormilon
Ah-uoh-uoh, perezoso y dormilon
Auh, ouh; auh, ouh; ouh, ouh
Perezoso y dormilon

Forever alone
No me hablen de amor
'Toy bien con mi gata, mi flia, mi' pana', mi gira, mi roll
Asi me siento mejor
Ma'-Ma' piquete, ma' flow
Salgo siempre en luna llena y me fui a la condenao' para el millon
Me tiene mal ese ron
Y ese fernet de litro
Y la Play 4, y el sushi
Los party', las mami' que vienen al show
Pero para despejarme
Solo prefiero acostarme
Quedar 'quilito en mi cama
Olvidar lo' celulares
Ese ratito no llamen
Ese momento no llamen
Que no voy a contestarle', no llamen, no llamen

Voy a contarle', contarle', contarles
Que no soy nadie tan interesante
Y por si queda' duda' como soy en serio
Aprovecho el ratito para confesarle' que soy

Chico tranquilo, sin nada para opinar
Siempre en lo mio, tal vez soy egoista
Pocos amigo', pero mucha historia pa' contar
Un reservado, loco, timido, pero pegao' (Aah)
Alguno' dicen si, otro' dicen que no (Aah)
Y la buena pa' ti, tambien la buena pa' vo'
Yo solo sigo aqui, sentadito en el sillon
Siendo un chico aburrido, perezoso y dormilon
Ah-uoh-uoh, perezoso y dormilon
Ah-uoh-uoh, perezoso y dormilon
Auh, ouh; auh, ouh; ouh, ouh
Perezoso y dormilon

I need a lover to trust, tell me you're on my side
Are you down for the ride?
It's not easy for someone to catch my eye
But I've been waitin' for you for my whole damn life
For my whole lifetime

Don't be afraid to tell me if you ain't with it (you ain't with it)
I see you're focused, yeah you're so independent (independent)
It's hard for me to open up, I'll admit it (I'll admit it)
You've got some shit to say and I'm here to listen


So baby, tell me where your love lies
Waste the day and spend the night
Underneath the sunrise
Show me where your love lies


I've been so into your mystery
Is it because of our history?
Are you into me?
When it feels so good, but it's bad for you
Can't say I don't want it 'cause I know I do
Come on over, I need your company
Cravin' that synergy

Don't be afraid to tell me if you ain't with it (you ain't with it)
I see you're focused, yeah, you're so independent (independent)
It's hard for me to open up, I'll admit it (I'll admit it)
You've got some shit to say and I'm here to listen


So baby, tell me where your love lies
Waste the day and spend the night
Underneath the sunrise

And I say stuff that I'll make up, like "I hate love"
And I hate that I can't lie, couldn't hate you if I tried
It'll suck for a week then hurt more on a weekend
When I go out and see your friends
And I don't know what to tell 'em
I can't lie, couldn't hate you if I tried

I'm coming around to see ya, coming around to leave ya
What is the point of hoping when it's already broken?
It hurts to let you go but it's worse to hold on
But I know that I'll be better when you're gone
Said I know that I'll be better when you're gone

When you're gone
Said I know that I'll be better when you're gone
Said I know that I'll be better when you're gone

Not even I'd hope, I'd hope
'Cause someone was dying
Whenever you're with me, you don't even try

I'm coming around to see ya, coming around to leave ya
What is the point of hoping when it's already broken?
It hurts to let you go but it's worse to hold on
But I know that I'll be better when you're gone

All it'd take is one flight
We'd be in the same time zone
Looking through your timeline
Seeing all the rainbows, I
I got an idea
And I know that it sounds crazy
I just wanna see ya
All I gotta ask

Do you got plans tonight?
I'm a couple hundred miles from Japan, and I
I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight
'Cause I-I-I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind (oh)

Yeah, I could feel the tension
We could cut it with a knife
I know it's more than just a friendship
I can hear you thinking 'bout it, yeah
Do I gotta convince you
That you shouldn't fall asleep?
It'll only be a couple hours
And I'm about to leave

Do you got plans tonight?
I'm a couple hundred miles from Japan, and I
I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight
'Cause I-I-I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind

Do you got plans tonight?
I was hoping I could get lost in your paradise
The only thing I'm thinking 'bout is you and I
'Cause I-I-I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
I can't seem to get you off my mind

Let's get lost tonight
Let's get lost tonight
Baby, you and
I can't seem to get you off my mind
Let's get lost tonight
Let's get lost tonight
Baby, you and
I can't seem to get you off my mind

Perdoname,
no se lo que paso contigo que no te veo como antes,
tus manos ya me daban frio
no tenia como calentarme.
Lo siento por apenas contarte,
no queria lastimarte.

Confieso que
en medio de tu descuido
he conocido mucha gente,
sabes que yo no soy de amigos
pero tu estabas tan ausente, tan distante,
las cosas cambian bastante,
has dejado de importarme.

Yo se como paso,
esa distancia que teniamos,
lentamente estaba matandonos.
Si hay un culpable aqui somos los dos,
pero ella no.

Tu nunca tenias tiempo
pa' nuestros encuentros,
la relacion iba tan lento
y tu siempre tenias un cuento.
Yo me perdia en el intento
de recuperar este sentimiento, pero
nunca pude, no me detuve
le pedi a mi Dios pa' que me ayude.
Tu con tus malas actitudes,
y otra me hacia solicitudes, y no.
Ella hizo lo que no hiciste,
no la culpes a ella mas,
si por tu culpa fue que me perdiste.

Yo se como paso,
esa distancia que teniamos,
lentamente estaba matandonos.
Si hay un culpable aqui somos los dos,
pero ella no.

A nadie quiero culpar,
no estoy en condicion de reclamar,
acepto que tambien he sido complice,
no soy el mismo que cuando te conquiste.
Lo que te voy a contar,
seguramente te va a hacer llorar,
alguien se dio cuenta de lo que pasaba,
se aprovecho cuando no estabas.

Perdoname,
no se lo que paso contigo que no te veo como antes,

Hope is a doggy
A sweet doggy
Standing next to a rose
A flower grows in the soil
There's still hope for life to exist
For us to survive
To thrive and survive
And find a way to live our lives
And live through this nuclear holocaust
Let's get it on

How will we survive?
With a little luck
And patience
And know-how
And love
We will survive
The nuclear holocaust
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

We will survive
And we will thrive
Must stay alive and we will strive
To make it to the top of the mountain
There shall be dragons and there shall be gorgons
There shall be many beasts with no name
Our trusty doggy will be there to save the day
Hope will find a way
Hope will find a way
---------------------------------------------------
Ah-ah-ah-ah
No

Entre tanta gente yo te vi llegar
Algo en el destino me hizo saludar
Te dije mi nombre y no se donde
Como con un beso me respondes
Solo te importo que te tratara bien
Tu de 19 y yo de 23
Y empece mis planes para vernos otra vez

Y si pudiera mostrarte
Que estando juntos ya no hay nada que falte
Y que a pesar de la distancia te voy a querer
Solo tienes que saber
Que yo quisiera quedarme
Y aunque no debo, solo quiero llamarte
Que repitamos las historias una y otra vez, no se

¿Como te pido que te enamores?
Cuando al final no voy a estar cuando tu llores
¿Como te pido que te ilusiones?
Y recortar nuestra distancia con canciones
¿Como te pido? Si al final no voy a estar
Cuando de ti me enamore
Cuando de ti me enamore, uh

Recuerdo todo lo que te gustaba
Y tu camisa que llega a los pies
Esa carita cuando te cantaba por primera vez
Me llevo todo y no me llevo nada
Sin ti no hay nada, todo te deje
Se que es muy pronto para estas palabras, pero las tire

Como tu mano y mi mano en la noche no sienten frio
Sin ti las horas se pasan, pero con dias vacios
Como en Marbella las olas, tu estabas bella y a solas
Y yo te extrano y te extrano, pero te llamo y lo olvido
Como te quiero y te quiero, pero este amor ya no es mio
Se que tu boca y mi boca cuando se juntan hay lio
Como quisiera quedarme, pero ahora no estas conmigo
Siempre la vida se pasa, pero no pasa contigo

¿Como te pido que te enamores?
Cuando al final no voy a estar cuando tu llores
¿Como te pido que te ilusiones?
Y recortar nuestra distancia con canciones
¿Como te pido? Si al final no voy a estar
Cuando de ti me enamore (Tu de 19 y yo de 23)
Cuando de ti me enamore (Tu de 19 y yo de 23)

Y aunque yo este en otra parte
Soy mas feliz porque yo pude encontrarte
Y aunque no tenga la certeza de volverte a ver
Es tuya esta cancion
Recuerdame
---------------------------------------------------
Drugs got me sweatin', but the room gettin' colder
Lookin' at the devil and the angel on my shoulder
Will I die tonight? I don't know, is it over?
Lookin' for my next high, I'm lookin' for closure

Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys

Told her if I die I'ma die young
Every day I've been gettin' fucked up
Finally know the difference between love and drugs
Shawty tell me I should really sober up
This shit ain't fiction, it's too real, too real
Fuck one dose, I need two pills, two pills
I'm lookin' for trouble so I know I'm gonna find it
Ring, ring, plug hit my phone, perfect timin'
I know I'm not right
But I'm not wrong, no, I'm not wrong
Girl, you hate it when I'm too high
But that's where I belong, where I belong

Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys

Eyes red, no Visine
Crashed the Mustang, no Saleen
Yeah, I love beans, yeah, I love lean
I laugh when they ask if my piss clean
Huh, smoke with me, huh, pop with me, huh
Ayy, Gucci store, come and shop with me
If I overdose, bae, are you gon' drop with me?
I don't even wanna think about that right now
Let's get too high, reach a new height
Take the shrooms and the pills at the same time
Went to Hollywood thrills from the street life
Took too many drugs, now I don't feel right

Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys (Bad kidneys)
---------------------------------------------------
You bring an energy I've never felt before
Some kind of chemical that reaches to my core
Feels like, as far as you and me, I've never had a choice
You feel like home, mmm

You're like the opposite of all of my mistakes
Tear down the biggest walls and put me in my place
I know that kind of comfortable you cannot replicate
You feel like home, mmm

So if you're asking me
Sayin', "Oh, how do you know?"
I don't just feel it in my heart
Don't just feel it in my heart
No, I feel it in my bones
I feel it in my bones

And I know when it cuts deep down
Through your chest into your soul
That's how you know
That's how I know
I feel it in my bones

And I know when it cuts deep down
Through your chest into your soul
That's how you know
That's how I know
I feel it in my bones

So many people just walk in and out your life
I'd trade a couple hundred just to get some time back, that's right
'Cause for you and me I got no alibi
You feel like home, oh

So if you're asking me
Sayin', "Oh, how do you know?"
I don't just feel it in my heart
Don't just feel it in my heart
No, I feel it in my bones
I feel it in my bones

And I know when it cuts deep down
Through your chest into your soul
That's how you know
That's how I know
I feel it in my bones
I feel it in my bones
I feel it in my bones
That's how you know
That's how I know

So if you're asking me
Sayin', "Boy, how do you know?"
I don't just feel it in my heart
Don't just feel it in my heart
No, I feel it in my bones
I feel it in my bones

And I know when it cuts deep down
Through your chest into your soul
That's how you know
That's how I know
I feel it in my bones
I feel it in my bones
I feel it in my bones
That's how you know
That's how I know
I feel it in my bones

Wake up and smell the coffee
Is your cup half full or empty?
When we talk, you say it softly
But I love it when you're awfully quiet, quiet

You see the piece of paper
Could be a little greater
Show me what you could make her
You'll never know until you try it
And you don't have to keep it quiet

And I know it makes you nervous
But I promise you, it's worth it
To show 'em everything you kept inside
Don't hide, don't hide
Too shy to say, but I hope you stay
Don't hide away
Come out and play

Look up, out of your window
See snow, won't let it in though
Leave home, feel the wind blow
'Cause it's colder here inside in silence
And you don't have to keep it quiet

Yeah, I know it makes you nervous
But I promise you, it's worth it
To show 'em everything you kept inside
Don't hide, don't hide
Too shy to say but I hope you stay
Don't hide away
Come out and play
---------------------------------------------------
I put my heart in my lyrics
I gave it all I could give
I made it hot at the crib
I kept that fire at the crib
Where you gon' go when you dip?
How I'ma know who for real?
I pour a four in a fifth
You already know what it is
I keep a pole in the whip
'Cause a lot of these niggas out here envy me
It ain't no ho in the clique
None of my dawgs got fuckboy tendencies
I don't even show no sympathy
Sipping on Hennessy, it got me bending sideways
Everything on me drippin', you niggas can't ride the wave
Nigga run around with the juice, nigga come spill your drank
I done earn my stripes now I'm tryna go get me some real rank

Readin' through my third eye 'cause I got tunnel vision
Had to open my mind, then I opened a Benz
It's like you gotta sell your soul for them to pay attention
Fuck all that playing, now I'm grown, I put my heart in it
I had to get down with that chrome to show them niggas I'm serious
And it's like every song I'm on, I be calling my spirits

I put my Hublot on rocks
I put moschato on rocks
Where I’m from we don’t say opp
Shoot at an OV, shoot at a cop
Shoot at the police, shoot at your top
I made a million off socks
Free all my niggas who stuck in a box
Locked up and watching the clock
Locked up, they fighting with locks
Locked up, they swinging they knifes
I can't be living this life
No more Bacardi, alright
I don't want Cardi so I'ma pour Henny on ice
My vision is vivid, told you I'm really a menace
I'll show you I'm destined to get it
I be outside with the glizzy
Toting that fire, I be trippin'
I just might die how I'm living
Ain't tell nobody, but I'm tripping
Niggas ain't catching me slipping, ayy, yeah
I make you laugh when you with me
Know that my swag is terrific (glee, glee)
Ain't seen my dad in a minute
But I can't be mad, I got millions
I just pulled up in a lemon
Thuggin', so fuck your opinion
I'm thuggin', so fuck how you feeling
I'm calling my spirit

Readin' through my third eye 'cause I got tunnel vision
Had to open my mind, then I opened a Benz
It's like you gotta sell your soul for them to pay attention
Fuck all that playing, now I'm grown, I put my heart in it
I had to get down with that chrome to show them niggas I'm serious
And it's like every song I'm on, I be calling my spirits

No, I don't say it often
And I probably should've told you I hurt this bad, I know
And I probably shouldn't want this so bad
It's weighing, weighing on me
Don't wanna wake up in the mornin'
Cannot undo what we did in this bed
And I can't get you out, so I gotta go
No, I'm not ready for, you want me all alone
But I'm undecided, excited, ignited
And I don't wanna feel the way I do, but I like it
Look at all these sparks flyin'
But I'm still indecisive
And she want me to wife it
But I'm undecided

I know I shouldn't be doing this, but here we go again
Girl you know that pussy is my weakness (Weakness, weakness, weakness)
Girl, you got me addicted when you switchin' positions
You tell me, "Shut up"
And you know I listen, I hit it
Wish I never did it
I can't keep sinnin' and pretendin'

I'm takin' off your clothes
We gettin' sexual
Hit it so good, think I'll propose
I don't know but

But I'm undecided, excited (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah), ignited (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I don't wanna feel the way I do, but I like it
Look at all these sparks flyin' (All these, all these)
But I'm still indecisive ('Cause you want me)
And she want me to wife it
But I'm undecided

Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do

Oh, no, I'm undecided

Do-do-do-do-do-do-do, yeah
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
I said I just don't know
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do

Ay 'cause I'm undecided
No, no, baby
I'm afraid of your love
Ooh, you got me baby
'Cause I can't get enough

I'm undecided, excited (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah), ignited (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I don't wanna feel the way I do, but I like it
Look at all these sparks flyin'
But I'm still indecisive
And she want me to wife it
But I'm undecided

Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do

No, no, oh, no, and I want it (I'm undecided)
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do, ayy
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do

No, no, no, no
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Ooh, but I'm undecided
---------------------------------------------------
Mirror mirror on the wall
Tunnel vision on the flaws
In the scale of things it's unimportant
So no talking but it's still an intrusive thought

Tried hard to correct it
But nothing was effective
No-one else seemed so obsessed with it, things were desperate
Until the voice crept in

I can help you, trust me, you're ready

It seemed dangerous
But it said to have faith in it

The secret is to just be empty

Didn't know if it was wise to listen
But what could it hurt to try?

And at first it was working
But then things were emerging
Cracked lips and Tired eyes
I'm hungry with no appetite

I'm shivering and shaking, and I tell myself it's fine, but
You can't fool your body, you can only fool your mind, yeah

Empty
I just need to be empty
Hide from anybody who'll prevent me
Just fill up on water and shame
No, I'm not hungry, I just ate

I've developed a taste for this
Endure the neverending ache
Convince myself I'm in control and it's not
All that voice that makes me sick

Inside it's empty
I know- I know it's wrong
I'm looking but I can't see myself

Inside it's empty
I know- I know it's wrong
But it's so hard to stop it alone

Been getting even worse
All the days begin to merge
Just a blurry haze and now it's
Almost second nature to ignore the urges

Can't trust my own nature
Every calorie a failure
Gotta push the intake down every day
'Cause the voice comes back to say

You want to eat? Bite your tongue

Don't want to stay an embarrassment
Just have to stomach it

They don't know what you want
A tug of war against common sense
Don't wanna believe that I've overstepped

But it's so overwhelming
And I hope no-one can tell
'Cause the numbers keep decreasing
This ordeal is becoming routine, check

Arms back neck thighs suck it in and pinch my sides
The scales are betraying me, the mirror is a lie, yeah

Numbers
It all comes down to numbers
I know it's wrong but
Just because you know you're colorblind
Doesn't mean you can see the colors

Fine, I admit I'm addicted
But the hunger feels good, how do I quit this
I know I could die, I've seen the statistics
But the voice is with me through thick and thin

Inside it's empty
I know- I know it's wrong
I'm looking but I can't see myself

Inside it's empty
I know- I know it's wrong
But it's so hard to stop it alone

Inside it's empty
I know- I know it's wrong
I'm looking but I can't see myself

Inside it's empty
I know- I know it's wrong
But it's so hard to stop it alone

I can reach out
To someone not like me
If you ask for help it doesn't make you weak

I can reach out
To someone not like me
I can help my mind learn to trust my body

I can reach out
To someone not like me
If you ask for help it doesn't make you weak

I can reach out
Ignore what the voice tells me
I can help my mind learn to trust my body

Inside it's empty
I know- I know it's wrong
I'm looking but I can't see myself

Inside it's empty
I know- I know it's wrong
But it's so hard to stop it alone

Inside it's empty
I can reach out (I can reach out)
Inside it's empty
I can reach out (I can reach out)
---------------------------------------------------
Whoa, yeah


I've been waiting (I've been waiting)
I've been waiting up 'cause I can't get enough, oh
I feel I'm fading (Yeah)
When I fall apart, your needle sews my heart, oh


Fuck me up and make me just go crazy
Addicted to the pain that you just made me love
I'm fiendin' for your touchin' on the daily
You're the only one that I want


Break my heart but don't tell me I'm not doin' fine
'Cause I'm doin' fine
Let me go, I'm spendin' time
Not doin' fine but I'm doin' fine


Why you actin' vain for my love, vain for my love
When you got everything that I want?
Why you actin' vain for my blood, vain for my blood
When you got everything that I want?
Why you actin'


I been dreamin'
Of your uniform, your uniform of non-conformity
The tears, the tears
Tears aren't strong enough, the years aren't long enough, no


Fuck me up and make me just go crazy
Addicted to the pain that you just made me love
I'm fiendin' for your touchin' on the daily
You're the only one that I want


Break my heart but don't tell me I'm not doin' fine
'Cause I'm doin' fine
Let me go, I'm spendin' time
Not doin' fine but I'm doin' fine


Why you actin' vain for my love, vain for my love
When you got everything that I want?
Why you actin' vain for my blood, vain for my blood
When you got everything that I want?
Why you actin' vain?


It's hard to miss you when you are always on the tip of my tongue
I feel like I'm looking for somethin', somethin' that'll never come

Call me when you're in the city again
My head just went oblivion
It's hard to miss you when you are always on the tip of my tongue
(Always on the tip of my tongue)


And now the time is right, you wanna do me so wrong
Now the time is right, you wanna do me so wrong
When I've been waitin' (I've been waitin')
Long for you (Long for you)


I wanna drink my wine, I wanna pass that by
I wanna make her cry, she wanna make me die
Apple pie, six cigarettes
And I'll catch the vibe that we can't forget


Why you actin' vain for my love, vain for my love
When you got everything that I want?
Why you actin' vain for my blood, vain for my blood
When you got everything that I want?
Why you actin' vain


It's hard to miss you when you are always on the tip of my tongue
I feel like I'm looking for somethin', somethin' that'll never come


I'll be waiting (I'll be waiting)
I'll be waiting (For you)
And now the time is right, you wanna do me so wrong
And now the time is right, you wanna do me so wrong
(I'll be waiting for you)

Her day starts with a coffee
And ends with a wine.
Takes forever getting ready.
So, she's never on time
For anything.

When she gets that come-get-me
Look in her eyes,
Well, it kinda scares me
The way that she drives
Me wild.
But she drives me wild.

Beautiful, crazy.
She can't help but amaze me.
The way that she dances,
Ain't afraid to take chances.
And wears her heart on her sleeve.
Yeah, she's crazy,
But her crazy is beautiful to me.

She makes plans for the weekend,
Can't wait to go out
'Til she changes her mind.
Says, "Let's stay on the couch
And watch TV."
And she falls asleep.

Beautiful, crazy.
She can't help but amaze me.
The way that she dances,
Ain't afraid to take chances.
And wears her heart on her sleeve.
Yeah, she's crazy,
But her crazy is beautiful to me.

She's unpredictable, unforgettable.
It's unusual, unbelievable.
How I'm such a fool!
Yeah, I'm such a fool for her.

Beautiful, crazy.
She can't help but amaze me.
The way that she dances,
Ain't afraid to take chances.
And wears her heart on her sleeve.
Yeah, she's crazy.
She's crazy.
She's crazy,
But her crazy is beautiful to me.
Her crazy is beautiful to me.

De la cintura al tobillo, ya me tienes el martillo
Saliendose a ver que es lo que es lo que pasa por el calzoncillo
Bajale, mami, como 7,500

Si tu me das un break, yo te voy a hacer un cuento
Quieres conocer a Junito, yo te lo presento (Ma')
Marrayo parta que presion

De la camisa, le explota el boton
Y por ti, yo voy con los suegros a Guavate a comer lechon

Tell me what you're crying for
I'll wipe your tears, oh love
If your soul is aching love
I will comfort you for sure

If we're caught in a wave, I will carry you over
It don't matter where you are, I'll run to your front door
When my head goes in different directions
You know my heart's never on the move
And in the dark times you don't have to question
If I'm a hundred with you

You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart
You could build a wall, I would run it up, up, up
Just to get to your heart
If we're caught in a wave
Baby, we'll make a way
You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart

Love, between our love
Love, between our love

Shadows play on idle hands
I lose myself, I do
But I find my way to velvet sands
I'll crash right into you

If we're caught in a wave, I will carry you over
It don't matter where we are, you're still the one I choose
When my head goes in different directions
You know my heart's never on the move
And in the dark times you don't have to question
If I'm a hundred with you

You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart
You could build a wall, I would run it up, up, up (run it up)
Just to get to your heart
If we're caught in a wave (in a wave)
Baby, we'll make a way
You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart

Love, between our love
Love, between our love

You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart
You could build a wall, I would run it up, up, up (run it up)
Just to get to your heart
If we're caught in a wave
Baby, we'll make a way
You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart
---------------------------------------------------
I feel a little nauseous and my hands are shaking
I guess that means you're close by
My throat is getting dry and my heart is racing
I haven't been by your side
In a minute, but I think about it sometimes
Even though I know it's not so distant
Oh, no, I still wanna reminisce it

I think of that night in the park, it was getting dark
And we stayed up for hours
What a time, what a time, what a time
You clinged to my body like you wanted it forever
What a time, what a time, what a time
For you and I
What a time, what a time
For you and I


I know we didn't end it like we're supposed to
And now we get a bit tense
I wonder if my mind just leaves out all the bad parts
I know we didn't make sense
I admit it that I think about it sometimes
Even though I know it's not so distant
Oh, no, I still wanna reminisce it


I think of that night in the park, it was getting dark
And we stayed up for hours
What a time, what a time, what a time
You clinged to my body like you wanted it forever
What a time, what a time, what a time
For you and I
What a time, what a time
For you and I

For you and I
For you and I
For you and I
What a time, what a time for you and I
What a time for you and I, yeah
What a time, what a time for you and I

I think of that night in the park, it was getting dark
And we stayed up for hours
What a lie, what a lie, what a lie
You clinged to my body like you wanted it forever
What a lie, what a lie, what a lie
For you and I
What a lie, what a lie
For you and I

For you and I (for you)
For you and I (for you)
For you and I (for you and I)
For you and I, yeah

No soy lo que crees, y si te dejas llevar
No me hago responsable si tu corazon no puede recuperar
Tu ere' el bien, yo soy el mal
Y no suelo acostumbrar
Nunca me ensenaron a amar

No te enamores de mi
No, no, no
No te enamores de mi, no
No, no, no
Tu corazon puedo partir
No, no, no
No te enamores de mi, no
No, no, no, no

Yo soy de esa' que toca el fin de semana no fallan en salir (En salir)
La que te pichea si te acercas a mi
Dime, ¿que te hace pensar que yo estare pa' ti? (Pa' ti)
Dime si son mis cadera' que te ilusionan
Porque yo se que no perdonan
Salvaje como amazona
No existe quien me doma (Me doma)

No te enamores de mi
No, no, no
No te enamores de mi, no
No, no, no
Tu corazon puedo partir
No, no, no
No te enamores de mi, no
No, no, no, oh

Mi cuerpo es un arte
Nadie lo toca, soy como la Mona Lisa
Yo le permito, se muere por tocar de prisa
Solo gana quien mi piel eriza
No te enamore', en guerra no muere gente si se avisa
Hago que pequen con mi cadera y sonrisa

I know you hear me when I cry
I try to hold it in at night
While you're sleepin' next to me
But it's your arms that I need this time (This time)

Look at the cards that we've been dealt
If you were anybody else
Probably wouldn't last a day
Every tear's a rain parade from hell (From hell)

Baby, you do it so well
You've been so understanding, you've been so good
And I'm puttin' you through more than one ever should
And I'm hating myself, 'cause you don't want to
Admit that it hurts you

I know that it breaks your heart when I cry again
Over him, mm
I know that it breaks your heart when I cry again
'Stead of ghostin' him

We'll get through this
We'll get past this
I'm a girl with
A whole lot of baggage
But I love you
We'll get past this
I'm a girl with
A whole lot of baggage, oh, yeah

Though I wish he were here instead
Don't want that living in your head
He just comes to visit me
When I'm dreaming every now and then (And then)

And after all that we been through
(And after all that we been through)
There's so much to look forward to
What was done and what was said
Leave it all here in this bed with you (With you)

Baby, you do it so well
You've been so understanding, you've been so good
And I'm puttin' you through more than one ever should
And I'm hating myself, 'cause you don't want to

I've got this habit, and I just can't stop
Every time I look at you, your clothes are coming off
And when we're talking, my mind is somewhere else
Back at my apartment you and me and no one else

I'm having visions, it's like I can see right through
I've got a feeling you know what I wanna do

I'm just gonna say it and I don't know how you'll take it
I think about you naked when I'm looking at you
My imagination got me losing concentration
I think about you naked when I'm looking at you
Always (do do do do do do)
Bout bout you (do do do do do do)
Think about you, bout bout you (do do do do do do)
Bout bout you
I think about you naked when I'm looking at you

My mind is crazy, playing tricks on me
And everyone around us don't see what I see
In a crowded bar, or a restaurant
Everybody doesn't know that you've got nothing on

I'm having visions, it's like I can see right through
I've got a feeling you know what I wanna do

I'm just gonna say it and I don't know how you'll take it
I think about you naked when I'm looking at you
My imagination got me losing concentration
I think about you naked when I'm looking at you
Always (do do do do do do)
Bout bout you
Think about you (do do do do do do)
Bout bout you
I think about you naked when I'm looking at you

Too many days I think about it
Too many nights I've spent without it
I need a way to get this started
Get you out of my head and get you in my arms

I'm just gonna say it and I don't know how you'll take it
I think about you naked when I'm looking at you
My imagination got me losing concentration
I think about you naked when I'm looking at you
Always (do do do do do do)
Thinkin' bout you (do do do do do do)
When I'm looking at you
Always
Bout bout you (do do do do do do)
I think about you naked when I'm looking at you

Desde que amanecimos en esa cama
Siempre me llama, pa' matar las ganas
Que hace tiempo que con el ya no siente nada
Por eso me llama, pa’ matar las ganas

A ella le gusta porque estoy PPP
Siempre puesto pa' darle placer
Ella me pide que le de y que le de
Y yo le hago to' lo que la complace
Que soy su nene, que soy su bebe
Se pone loquita cuando me ve en la TV
Ella me pide que le de y que le de
Y yo le hago de to’, de to'

Bebe, solo tu me fascina', que rico tenerte encima
Tu boquita me domina, tu y yo bailando en una esquina
Siente el roce, roce, te vuelves loquita con las pose, pose
'Tamos en el cielo con el 2C, 2C
Tu eres mi baby personal, mi gatita exclusive

Lo nuestro sobrepasa una adiccion
No tenemos sexo hacemos el amor

A ella le gusta porque estoy PPP
Siempre puesto pa' darle placer
Ella me pide que le de y que le de
Y yo le hago to' lo que la complace
Que soy su nene, que soy su bebe
Se pone loquita cuando me ve en la TV
Ella me pide que le de y que le de
Y yo le hago de to', de to'

We been quiet
Said we'd try it
For a while
But that was years ago

If you see me, if I see you
A part of me hopes that we do, no
Say everything we wanted to
After all this time

I cut the tree down that we grew
You know the one we carved our names into?
Still, I can't go back to the places we knew
'Cause they ask me if I still think about you

Only all the time
(Still think about you)
(Think about you)
Only all the time
(Still think about you)
(Think about you)
Only all the time
Only all the time
(Still think about you)

(Still think about you)
(Think about you)
Only all the time
(Still think about you)
(Think about you)
Only all the time

Hometown drivin'
Autopilot
My phone's on silent
In case you call

If you see me, if I see you
A part of me hopes that we do, no
Say everything we wanted to
After all this time

I cut the tree down that we grew
You know the one we carved our names into?
Still, I can't go back to the places we knew
'Cause they ask me if I still think about you

The world on drugs
Ten (Yeah) thousand-dollar plates
Thousand-dollar plates
{Thousand-dollar plates, fine china}
{Shorty like a, uh}
Shorty like a
(Wheezy outta here)


Shorty like a thousand-dollar plate, fine china
Tell her that she beautiful every day, I remind her
Then I jump in her pussy like a lake, I'm a diver
And her last man was a pussy, had a vagina
I get lost in her eyes, like dust from the skies
It's her body or nobody, I refuse to compromise
So if she leaves, I'ma kill her, oh, she'll die
Did I say that out loud? I'm so crazy about mine

Goin' insane, feel you pickin' up and movin' things inside my brain
I know I don't have to argue about everything
But we don't have the same soul
Would've sold yours too and got a bigger bankroll
You tell me that you love me, baby, say it again
Repeat it over and over until it's in my brain
Picked up the drugs so I let my brain go
Would've fried yours too, but I'm selfish about my Percs, oh

Shorty like a thousand-dollar plate, fine china
Tell her that she beautiful every day, I remind her
Then I jump in her pussy like a lake, I'm a diver
And her last man was a pussy, had a vagina
I get lost in her eyes, like dust from the skies
It's her body or nobody, I refuse to compromise
So if she leaves, I'ma kill her, oh, she'll die
Did I say that out loud? I'm so crazy about mine


I'm so crazy about mine (Wheezy outta here)
I'm goin' to Pluto with my girl (Oh, shorty)
I'm goin' to Jupiter with my girl (Don't call your exes)
I'm goin' to Mars with my girl (Don't call your exes)
I'm goin' to Saturn with my girl
Been feelin' like I'm runnin' out of space
You need to send your location, I can't think
I done fell in love twice but I gotta be lyin'
'Cause I'm livin' ten lives, I go crazy about mines, ay


Shorty like a thousand-dollar plate, fine china
Tell her that she beautiful every day, I remind her
Then I jump in her pussy like a lake, I'm a diver

I saw her do it after school, she's an animal

And she won't ever love no boy
She'll treat you like a fucking toy
She'll break your heart and steal your joy, like a criminal

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
I wanna know her like you-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou
I wanna know her like you-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou
I wanna be that cool
I wanna be that

Mary keeps you off her mind
She wants to spend her weekend right
Out with her friends just getting high, like a stoner girl

And you wait outside on her street
You sit for hours just to see
The girl you pictured in a dream as the only girl

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
I wanna know her like you-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou
I wanna know her like you-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou
I wanna be that cool
I wanna be that

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
I wanna know her like you-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou
I wanna know her like you-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou
I wanna be that cool
I wanna be that

Thinkin' about you
As I'm lyin' next to someone else
Drinkin' without you, hm
Doesn't fix me but it kinda helps

Oh I still wish we could go back
To where we started
When you left your t-shirt
At my old apartment
Have you ever wondered
If you loved me harder
Where we'd be
Where we'd be now

Yeah we got so close, so close to love
But you had to go and mess it up
Was it all too much or just not enough
When we got so close, so close to love

Yeah we got so close, so close to love
But you had to go and mess it up
Was it all too much or just not enough
When we got so close, so close to love

I never noticed
I was busy tryna work this out
Why was I holdin' on,
When I knew you'd only let me down?

But I still wish we could go back
To where we started
When you left your t-shirt
At my old apartment
Have you ever wondered
If you loved me harder
Where we'd be
Where we'd be now

Yeah we got so close, so close to love
But you had to go and mess it up
Was it all too much or just not enough
When we got so close, so close to love

I saw you looking brand new overnight
I caught you looking too, but you didn't look twice
You look happy, oh
You look happy, oh

Flashing back to New York City
Change your flight so you stay with me
Remember thinking that I got this right

And now I wish we never met
'Cause you're too hard to forget
While I'm cleaning up your mess
I know he's taking off your dress
And I know that you don't
But if I ask you if you love me
I hope you li-li-li-lie
Lie to me

It's 3 AM and the moonlight's testing me
If I can make it till dawn then it won't be hard to see
I ain't happy, oh
I ain't too happy, oh

Flashing back to New York City
Change your flight so you stay with me
Problem was I thought I had this right

Now I wish we never met
'Cause you're too hard to forget
While I'm cleaning up your mess
Know he's taking off your dress
I know that you don't
But if I ask you if you love me
I hope you li-li-li-lie
Lie to me

Singing li-li-li-lie, li-li-li-li-li-lie

And I know that you don't
But if I ask you if you love me
I hope you li-li-li-lie
Lie to me

Saturday nights, blueberry cigarillos
Swishers make my throat hurt
Rolling OCB's on the side for me
Light 'em up and let 'em both burn
Family feuds, say your mom's confused
Off of shit she doesn't wanna learn
But daddy's gone, say he's never home
And wishing only makes it worse

I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep
'Cause they'll only know what you let 'em see

All the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
And all the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do

Saturday nights, light gray Silverado
You drive it 'cause you have to
Stay up working late at a job you hate
Fix your makeup in a dirty bathroom
No more love, in and out of clubs
Knowing what you gotta do
You've got plans wrapped in rubber bands
And that's the only thing you'll never lose

I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep
'Cause they'll only know what you let 'em see

All the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
And all the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do

'Cause I care, I care about you
There's nowhere I'd rather be
Than right here around you
I care, care about you
There's nowhere I'd rather be

All the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care about you
Nowhere like I do
All the things that I know
That your parents don't
Don't care about you
Nowhere like I
Nowhere like I do (Do, do, do)
Nowhere like I do (Do, do, do)
Nowhere like I do (Do, do, do)
Nowhere like I do (Do, do, do)
---------------------------------------------------
(So where are you? It's been a little while...)

Sippin' on straight chlorine, let the vibe slide over me
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical
When I leave don't save my seat, I'll be back when it's all complete
The moment is medical, moment is medical
Sippin' on straight chlorine

Lovin' what I'm tastin'
Venom on my tongue
Dependent at times
Poisonous vibrations
Help my body run

I'm runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-fe
Runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-fe

Sippin' on straight chlorine, let the vibe slide over me
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical
When I leave don't save my seat, I'll be back when it's all complete
The moment is medical, moment is medical
Sippin' on straight chlorine

Fall out of formation
I plan my escape from walls they confined
Rebel red carnation
Grows while I decay

I'm runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-fe
Runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-fe
Yeah, I'm runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-fe
Runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-fe

Hide you in my coat pocket, where I kept my rebel red
I felt I was invincible, you wrapped around my head
Now different lives I lead, my body lives on lead
The last two lines may read incorrect until said
The lead is terrible in flavor
But now you double as a papermaker
I despise you sometimes
I love to hate the fight and you in my life is like

Sippin' on straight chlorine, let the vibe slide over me
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical
When I leave don't save my seat, I'll be back when it's all complete
The moment is medical, moment is medical
Sippin' on straight chlorine

(Let the vibe, let the vibe)
(Let the vibe, let the vibe)
Beat is a chemical, yeah
(Let the vibe, let the vibe)
(Let the vibe, let the vibe)
Moment is medical, yeah
Sippin' on straight chlorine
(Let the vibe, let the vibe)
(Let the vibe, let the vibe)
Beat is a chemical, yeah
(Let the vibe, let the vibe)
(Let the vibe, let the vibe)
Moment is medical, yeah

I'm so sorry, I forgot you
Let me catch you up to speed
I've been tested like the ends of
A weathered flag that's by the sea

Can you build my house with pieces?
I'm just a chemical
Can you build my house with pieces?
I'm just a chemical
Can you build my house with pieces?
I'm just a chemical
Can you build my house with pieces?
I'm just a chemical
---------------------------------------------------
Killed the demons of my mind
Ever since you came around
We're a river, running wild
How could I have been so blind?

I just live a fast life
Forget about the past time
I'm numb out to escape my feels
And friendships only pass by
Show up, gone, like strobe lights
But with you I feel something real

And I'd walk a million miles just to see your smile
Till the day I die
Oh, I need you by my side, we get high on life
Till the day we die
High on life till the day we die
High on life till the day we die
High on life till the day we die
And I'd walk a million miles, just to see your smile
Till the day I die

High on life till the day we die

Through my fingers, out of sight
How could I have let you go?
Cutting corners, turning stones
But I can only see your ghost

I just live a fast life
Forget about the past time
Numb up to escape my feels
And friendships only passed by
The show and calling strobe lights
With you I feel something real

And I'd walk a million miles just to see your smile
Till the day I die
Oh, I need you by my side, we'd get high on life
Till the day we die

High on life till the day we die
Oh, I need you by my side, we'd get high on life
Till the day we die
High on life till the day we die

And I'd walk a million miles just to see your smile
Till the day I die
Oh, I need you by my side, we'd get high on life
Till the day we die

JD On Tha Track
Iceberg want a bag, bitch


We pop out at your party, I'm with the gang
And it's gon' be a robbery, so tuck ya chain
I'm a killer, girl, I'm sorry, but I can't change
We ain't aimin' for your body, shots hit your brain
We come from poverty, man, we ain't have a thing
It's a lot of animosity, but they won't say my name
Them killers rock with me, lil' nigga, don't get banged
'Cause they'll do the job for me while I hop on a plane

She don't like her body, left the doctor with a new shape
Blowing up my phone 'cause she just see me with my new bae
Heartbreaker, ladies love me like I'm Cool J
She was tryna cling onto a nigga but it's too late
Booked a flight to Cali, racks and condoms in my suitcase
And every single dollar in these bands got a blue face
Diamonds in the Rollie, they in HD like it's Blu-Ray
The way that I been ballin' should make the cover of 2K
Show out for the summer I might pull up in a new Wraith
Dissin' on the gang that's gon only get your crew chased
And we hawk shit down better tighten up yo shoe lace

---------------------------------------------------
Made plans with me and all your friends
I'm late again, I hate to keep you waiting
Tried to be a gentleman
Got drunk again, before I even made it
Tried to call a car for you
You're tired of me, I knew you wouldn't take it
You walked a mile in LouisVuittons
And fucked em up, you know that they're my favorite

But we dress up and play pretend
Then we act like we're good again
I do things I can't defend
And even when you hold it in

Hold it, even though it kills you slowly
Explosions, hidden when we're in the open
Keep on smiling, until it's over
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly

Arguments that never end
You're talkin shit, to spice up conversation
I'm so sick of back and forth
These fights with you are starting to feel contagious
Said that I'm no good for you
Right before we walked into your parents'
Then you put on that smile again
And grabbed my hand, even though you hate it

But we dress up and play pretend
Then we act like we're good again
I do things I can't defend
And even when you hold it in

Hold it, even though it kills you slowly
Explosions, hidden when we're in the open
Keep on smiling, until it's over
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly

Oh but, but it it, won't but, I said
You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't
Oh but, but it it, won't but, I said
You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't

Hold it, even though it kills you slowly
Explosions, hidden when we're in the open
Keep on smiling, until it's over
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly

Oh but, but it it, won't but, I said
(Hold it, even though it kills you slowly)
You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't
Oh but, but it it, won't but, I said
(Explosions, hidden when we're in the open)
You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't
(Keep on smiling, until it's over)
Oh but, but it it, won't but, I said
You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't
(Hold it, even though it kills you slowly)
Oh but, but it it, won't but, I said
You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't
---------------------------------------------------
It's been seven minutes now since I lost my way
It doesn't seem that long, but my whole world has changed
It's in all the little things, when you smile, now it stings
It's been seven minutes since I lost the girl of my dreams

It's been half an hour now since I dropped you home
And I'm driving past the places we both know
Past the bar where we first kissed and that movie that we missed
'Cause we were hanging out in the parking lot

Now I sink a little deeper, think a little clearer
Looking at myself through these new-found eyes

Is it too late to turn around?
I'm already halfway out of town
Now I know how I let you down
Oh, I finally figured it out

I forgot to love you, love you, love you
I forgot to love you, love you, love you

Radio was playing songs for me and you
"Chasing Cars" reminds me of nights in your room
Drinking wine under your window, back when life was so damn simple
How the hell did I end up losing you?

Is it too late to turn around?
I'm already halfway out of town
Now I know how I let you down
Oh, I finally figured it out

I forgot to love you, love you, love you
I forgot to love you, love you, love you
I forgot to love you, love you, love you
I forgot to love you, love you

If I came back now would you still be there?
If I come around, would you even care?
If I came back now would you still be there?
If I come around, would you even care?

Is it too late to turn around?
I'm already halfway out of town
Now I know how I let you down
Oh, I finally figured it out

I forgot to love you, love you, love you
I forgot to love you, love you, love you
I forgot to love you, love you, love you
I forgot to love you, love you, love you

Tu sabe' como jugar con mi mente, -te (Mente, eh)

Me besa' como si lo quisiera' to' (Eh-eh)
Pero no quiere' nada (Ah)
Tu me sube' y me baja' (Esta, esta pu–)
Esta puesta pa' ver, a ti ni el diablo te amarra

¿Quien te controla?
Tu naciste pa' morir sola
Vienes y vas
Y no hay marinero pa' esa ola
¿Quien te controla?
Tu mueres sola, sola
A ti no hay quien te gardee
En tu cancha esta la ola

Bebe, tu me miente' (Baby)
Y ningun hombre a ti te sorprende, uah
Bebe, tu me ama'
Pero tu siempre esconde' lo que siente', tu ere' incoherente (Bebe)
Y tu te trepa encima 'e mi (Eh-eh)
Y yo te como en mi cama
Pero tu me deja' en la nada
Tu doble personalidad siempre te tiene desolada
Y mi consciencia me habla (Uah)
Y te odia y siempre te difama (Baby)
Y siempre 'tamo peleando
Pero terminamo' en mi casa, tu to'a mojada (Uah)

¿Quien te controla? (Controla)
Tu naciste pa' morir sola (Uah)
Vienes y vas (Y vas)
Y no hay marinero pa' esa ola (Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)

En tu cancha esta la ola

(Por ti, por ti)
Por ti me da la paranoia cuando prendo
Pienso que esta' fallando cuando nadie te esta viendo
Solo ere' mia cuando esta' encima 'e mi
¿Por que ere' asi?
¿Que va' a hacer? Tiene' que decidir
Baby, dime
Que esta' en linea y tu no me escribe'
¿Tiene' miedo que de mi no te olvide'?
Y cree' que yo te vo' a lastimar
Pero estas mal
A ti te fallaron, por eso ere' una hij'eputa
Dicen que lo malo e' lo mas que uno se disfruta
Pero no le falle' al que te valore
Me se tu' intencione'
Por gente como tu e' que se entierran la' emocione'

Tu sabe' como jugar con mi mente, -te (Mente, eh)
Dice' que no quiere' compromiso, pero cuando me tiene' de frente, -te (Uah, uah)
Me besa' como si lo quisiera' to' (Eh-eh)
Pero no quiere' nada (Ah)

Some guy skipped in front of me
Can't believe I paid an entry fee
And I don't even got the energy
To smile for a selfie
And I know that I should go home
But I'm still standing here so
I guess one more for the road
I wanna raise a toast so

This one's for the sparklers
Dudes wearing shades in the darkness
But hats off to the DJ
Same song twice in an evening (one, two, three)

Oh, save me (save me), can't take it (take it)
I don't belong in this club
One dance (one dance), no chance (no chance)
'Cause I'm feeling awkward as (oh)

I was waiting in line for an hour
Just to get in, now I wanna get out 'cause (oh)
I'm jaded (I'm jaded), can't fake it (can't fake it)
I don't belong in this club, no


Hopped out of the Uber (Uber)
I was feeling myself (goddamn)
Had the polo with the bolo (I did)
With some eel on the belt (hoo)

Walked up to the bouncer (hey, what's up, man?)
Whole squad on stealth (I'm Macklemore)
He said, "Mackler, who?" (It's me)
"You gotta wait like everybody else."

Shoulda stayed on the sofa
Forgot I hate being social
And I miss my ex-girl
This Drake song making me 'motional
(girl, you hurt my feelings)

I'm feeling awkward as hell (uh-huh)
I only came here to dance (wassup?)
The dj ain't playing the cuts (no)
And what do I do with my hands? (it's awkward)

Roll with the punches and hold my Red Bull up
And I toast the nights like this that I probably won't remember much
'Bout to pull that Irish goodbye, grab my stuff, 'bout to cut
And the DJ yells, "Macklemore in the house tonight!"
Ah, fuck


Oh, save me (save me), can't take it (take it)
I don't belong in this club (club)
One dance (one dance), no chance (no chance)
'Cause I'm feeling awkward as (oh)

I was waiting in line for an hour
Just to get in, now I wanna get out 'cause (oh)
I'm jaded (I'm jaded), can't fake it (can't fake it)
I don't belong in this club

And to think that I've waited all week (no)
To get someone's drink spilled over me (I)
I don't care if the Uber's on surge (no, I don't, no)
I'd do anything to get out of this club

Save me, can't take it, no
I don't belong in this club
One dance, no chance
'Cause I'm feeling awkward as (oh)

I was waiting in line for an hour
Just to get in, now I wanna get out 'cause (oh)
I'm jaded (I'm jaded), can't fake it (can't fake it)
I don't belong in this club
