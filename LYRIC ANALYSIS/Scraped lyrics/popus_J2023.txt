And how you don't know how to keep your business clean

Mummy don't know daddy's getting hot

(Perreamos toda la noche y nos dormimo' a las die')
Llegue al club con el combo, rapido la vi lejos
Se pintaba los labios y la copa como espejo
Se acerco poco a poco y yo queriendo que me baile
Luego me dijo: "Vamos, que te enseno Buenos Aire'"

Y nos fuimos en una, empezamo' a la una
Y con la nota rapido nos dieron las tres
Perreamos toda la noche y nos dormimo' a las die'
Ando rezandole a Dios pa' repetirlo otra ve'
Y nos fuimos en una, empezamo' a la una
Y con la nota rapido nos dieron las tre'
Perreamos toda la noche y nos dormimo' a las diez
Ando rezandole a Dios pa' repetirlo otra ve' (Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh-eh)

Dime, beba
Fecha y hora y te paso a buscar
Yo le llego donde los demas tu sabes que no le llegan
Ruido de botellas de champan de las copas al brindar
Pero solo escucho como late (Eh-eh, eh-eh)
Mi corazon cuando veo ese cuerpo 'e escaparate
El traje combina con la Mercede' granate
No hay otro por mas que ellos traten (Yeah)

Quedate
Que las noches sin ti duelen
Tengo en la mente las pose' y todos los gemido'
Que ya no quiero nada que no sea contigo
Quedate
Que las noches sin ti duelen
Tengo en la mente las pose' y todo lo que hicimo'
Que ya no quiero nada que no sea contigo

Dale, guacha, suelta (Suelta)
Vente pa' Canaria' sin el equipaje y sin viaje de vuelta
Por la isla te vo'a dar una vuelta
Bebe, solo avisa
El sabado teteo, el domingo misa
Estoy a ver si me garantiza'
Que te me pegas como quien graba con Biza
Y vi salir a las amigas del party y ella se quedo
Mirandonos a los ojo', no al reloj
Y nos fuimos en Uber al apartamento
En privado me pedia que le diera un concierto
Le dije que por meno' de un beso no canto

Y nos fuimos en una, empezamo' a la una
Y con la nota rapido nos dieron las tre'
Perreamos toda la noche y nos dormimo' a las die'
Ando rezandole a Dios pa' repetirlo otra ve'

Quedate
Que las noches sin ti duelen
Tengo en la mente las pose' y todos los gemido'
Que ya no quiero nada que no sea contigo
Quedate
Que las noches sin ti duelen
Tengo en la mente las pose' y todo lo que hicimo'
Que ya no quiero nada que no sea contigo

¡Bizarrap!
Quevedo con el Biza, yeah-yeah-yeah
LPGC, you know, oh-oh (Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh-eh)

Middle of the floor, that's where I'll be
Don't got a lot, but that's enough for me, yeah

'Cause I'm good, yeah, I'm feelin' alright

Te bloquee de Insta
Pero por otra cuenta veo tus historias
Tu numero lo borre
No se pa' que, si me lo se de memoria

Me hiciste dano
Y asi te extrano
Y aunque se que un dia te voy a olvidar
Aun no lo hago
Es complicado
To' lo que hicimos me gusta recordar

Ando manejando por las calles que me besaste
Oyendo las canciones que un dia me dedicaste
Te diria que volvieras, pero eso no se pide
Mejor le pido a Dios que me cuide
Porque ando manejando por las calles que me besaste
Oyendo las canciones que un dia me dedicaste
Te diria que volvieras, pero eso no se pide
Mejor le pido a Dios que me cuide, eh

Que me cuide de otra que se parezca a ti
No quiero caer como hice por ti
Ojala te enamores
Te hagan lo mismo que me hiciste a mi
Tu me ensenaste a no amar a cualquiera
Y tambien como no quiero que me quieran

No
Eramos tres en una relacion de dos
No te perdono, pidele perdon a Dios
Dije que te olvide y la verdad es que yo
Yo

Ando manejando por las calles que me besaste
Oyendo las canciones que un dia me dedicaste
Te diria que volvieras, pero eso no se pide
Mejor le pido a Dios que me cuide
Porque ando manejando por las calles que me besaste
Oyendo las canciones que un dia me dedicaste
Te diria que volvieras, pero eso no se pide
Mejor le pido a Dios que me cuide, eh

Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, ey
En la guagua se quedo el olor de tu perfume
Tu ere' una bellaca, yo soy un bellaco, eso e' lo que no' une
Ella sabe que esta buenota y no la presumen
Si yo fuera tu gato, subiera una foto los vierne' y los lune' (So)

Pa' que to' el mundo vea lo rica que tu esta', que tu esta'
Contigo tengo que apretar
Y en la calle ando suelto, pero por ti me quito
Si tu me lo pides, yo me porto bonito
Y subo un selfie pa' que vean lo rica que tu esta', que tu esta'
Las otras tienen que apretar
En la calle ando suelto, pero por ti me quito
Si tu me lo pide', yo me porto bonito

Ey, ey
Tu no ere' bebecita, tu ere' bebesota

Si el novio no sirve, de una lo bota
Y wow, mami, dime donde dejo el resume (Resume)
Se que te dejaste hace un me' (Ey, ey)
Y de una de pecho me zumbe
Si quiere' te hago un bebe o te traigo la' plan B
Uff, mami, que rica tu te ve'
Pa' los 2000 escuchaba RBD
Y ahora quiere perreo, toa' la noche en la pared
Te obsesiono, CBD

Mami, tu ere' elite (Ey), no te me limite' (Okey)
Dejame hacerte lo que amerite y te levite
Dale pa'l escondite (Ey), no te me arisque' (So)
Que aqui no van a poder llegar lo' satelite'
Mami, sube algo, dame contenido
Ese culo subelo ma' seguido
Me paso jangueando a ver si coincido, ey
Y por fin doy contigo
Mai, nuestra' bellaquera' nunca la' olvido
Ninguna como tu a mi me ha complacido
Tu cree' que a toda' siempre les digo lo mismo
Quiere chingar, pero no quiere na' fijo, ey
Pero en confianza me confiesa
Dice que nadie le interesa
Pero cuando sale, se pone traviesa (Ey)

Pa' que to' el mundo vea lo rica que tu esta', que tu esta', ey
Contigo tengo que apretar
Y en la calle ando suelto, pero por ti me quito
Si tu me lo pide', yo me porto bonito

Esta noche en la cama va a haber turbulencia'
Que rico tu mama', te vo'a dar la permanencia'

Se puso mas bicha, pero no pierde la esencia

O va' a ser otro pa' la cola
Tu crico te me amola
Yo soy fan de esa popola (Mua, mua)

I don't know what you've been told
But time is running out, no need to take it slow
I'm stepping to you toe-to-toe
I should be scared, honey, maybe so

But I ain't worried 'bout it right now (Right now)
Keeping dreams alive, 1999, heroes
I ain't worried 'bout it right now (Right now)
Swimmin' in the floods, dancing on the clouds below

I ain't worried 'bout it
I ain't worried 'bout it (Hey)

I don't know what you've been told
But time is running out so spend it like it's gold
I'm living like I'm nine-zeros
Got no regrets even when I am broke (Yeah)
I'm at my best when I got something I'm wanting to steal
Way too busy for them problems and problems to feel (Yeah, yeah)
No stressing, just obsessing with sealing the deal
I'll take it in and let it go

But I ain't worried 'bout it right now (Right now)
Keeping dreams alive, 1999, heroes
I ain't worried 'bout it right now (Right now)
Swimmin' in the floods, dancing on the clouds below

I ain't worried 'bout it
I ain't worried 'bout it (Hey)

Ooh, I ain't worried
Ooh, oh, no, no

I ain't worried 'bout it right now (Right now)
Keeping dreams alive, 1999, heroes

Swimmin' in the floods, dancing on the clouds below

I ain't worried 'bout it (Ooh, hey)

I ain't worried 'bout it

---------------------------------------------------
Hace mucho tiempo le hago caso al corazon
Y pasan los dias, los meses, pensando en tu olor
Ha llegado el tiempo para usar la razon
Ante' que sea tarde y sin querer me parta en dos

Antes de que salga el sol
Brinda el acelerador
Que baile sin freno y pierda el control
Nada mas seremos dos
Tu y yo acariciandonos
En medio del tiempo, sin decir adios

Y solo mirame
Con esos ojitos lindos
Que con eso yo estoy bien
He vuelto a nacer

Hace tiempo que no agarro a nadie de la mano
Hace tiempo que no envio "Buenos dias, te amo"
Pero tu me tiene' enredao, me envolvi
Iba por mi camino y me perdi
Mi mirada cambio cuando tus ojos vi
Bye bye a lo oscuro, ni me despedi

Yo no te busque, no
Chocamo' en el trayecto
Con tu alma es lo que yo conecto
Tranquila, no tiene que ser perfecto, no

Aqui no existe el pecado
Y equivocarse es bonito
Los errores son placeres
Igual que to' tus besito'

Y solo mirame
Con esos ojitos lindos
Que con eso yo estoy bien
He vuelto a nacer

Y solo mirame
Con esos ojitos lindos
Que con eso yo estoy bien
He vuelto a nacer

Tu y yo, tu y yo, tu y yo
Tu y yo, tu y yo
Tu y yo, tu y yo, tu y yo
Tu y yo, tu y yo

Tu y yo, tu y yo
Tu y yo, tu y yo

Yo no me dejo llevar de nadie
Yo solo me dejo llevar de tu sonrisa
Y del lunar cerquita de tu boca
Si yo estoy loco, tu estas loquita
Pero, baby, como tu no hay otra, no
Quiero regalarte girasoles
Ir pa' la playa y buscarte caracoles
Cuando estoy contigo, yo no miro el Rolex
Vamo' a bailar doscientas canciones
Nadie me pone como tu me pones
Hm-hm, hm-hm-hm-hm
Hm-hm, hm-hm-hm-hm

Yo le hablo a Dios y tu eres su respuesta
Aprendi que los momentos lindos nunca cuestan
Como cuando me regalas tu mirada
Y el sol su puesta, y el sol su puesta
Ey, ey

Cuando estoy encima de ti, de ti
Mami, yo me olvido de todo, de todo
No hace falta nadie aqui
Solamente tu y yo

Antes de que salga el sol
Brinda el acelerador
Que baile sin freno y pierda el control
Nada mas seremos dos
Tu y yo acariciandonos
En medio del tiempo, sin decir adios

Y solo mirame
Con esos ojitos lindos
Que con eso yo estoy bien
He vuelto a nacer

Y solo mirame
Con esos ojitos lindos
Que con eso yo estoy bien
Hoy he vuelto a nacer
---------------------------------------------------
Come on, Harry, we wanna say goodnight to you

Holdin' me back
Gravity's holdin' me back
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
Why don't we leave it at that?
Nothin' to say
When everything gets in the way
Seems you cannot be replaced
And I'm the one who will stay, oh-oh-oh

In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same

Answer the phone
"Harry, you're no good alone
Why are you sitting at home on the floor?
What kind of pills are you on?"
Ringin' the bell
And nobody's coming to help
Your daddy lives by himself
He just wants to know that you're well, oh-oh-oh

In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same

Go home, get ahead, light-speed internet
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
Leave America, two kids follow her
I don't wanna talk about who's doin' it first

(Hey)
As it was
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
---------------------------------------------------
Si yo no te escribo, tu no me escribes, ey
Si tu quieres, te busco, yo se donde tu vives
Quizas hoy estas aborrecia
Pero por dentro tu tienes alegria

Si quieres, te la saco
Dos tragos y sabes que me pongo bellaco

Despues de la alarma te lo voy a dar, ey
Hoy tu no vas a trabajar
Ja, no

Si quieres, te la saco
Dos tragos y sabes que me pongo bellaco
No somos na', pero estamo' envuelto' hace rato
WhatsApp sin el retrato, no guarda mi contacto

Dos tragos y sabes que me pongo bellaco
No somos na', pero estamo' envuelto' hace rato
WhatsApp sin el retrato, no guarda mi contacto

She'd take the world off my shoulders
If it was ever hard to move
She'd turn the rain to a rainbow
When I was living in the blue
Why then, if she's so perfect
Do I still wish that it was you?
Perfect don't mean that it's working
So what can I do?

When you're out of sight
In my mind

Cause sometimes I look in her eyes
And that's where I find a glimpse of us
And I try to fall for her touch
But I'm thinking of the way it was
Said I'm fine and said I moved on
I'm only here passing time in her arms
Hoping I'll find
A glimpse of us

Tell me he savors your glory
Does he laugh the way I did?
Is this a part of your story?
One that I had never lived
Maybe one day you'll feel lonely
And in his eyes, you'll get a glimpse
Maybe you'll start slipping slowly
And find me again

When you're out of sight
In my mind

Cause sometimes I look in her eyes
And that's where I find a glimpse of us
And I try to fall for her touch
But I'm thinking of the way it was
Said I'm fine and said I moved on
I'm only here passing time in her arms
Hoping I'll find
A glimpse of us

Ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Cause sometimes I look in her eyes
And that's where I find a glimpse of us
And I try to fall for her touch
But I'm thinking of the way it was
Said I'm fine and said I moved on
I'm only here passing time in her arms
Hoping I'll find
A glimpse of us
---------------------------------------------------
All I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach but I stand
In California with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater
Let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high waisted shorts, oh

She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no

'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides a mind
To move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue
'Cause you love the taste, yeah
These hearts adore
Everyone the other beats hardest for
Inside this place is warm
Outside it starts to pour

Comin' down
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about
No, no, no

'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater, woah

Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah

'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
'Cause it's too cold for you here
Now, let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

And it's too cold, it's too cold
The holes of my sweater
---------------------------------------------------
Yo 'toy puesto pa' ti y tu te me quita'
Diablo, que piquete la chamaquita
El corazon lo puso en la neverita
Dice que este verano se queda solita
Yo 'toy puesto pa' ti y tu te me quita'
Diablo, que piquete la chamaquita
El corazon lo puso en la neverita
Dice que este verano se queda solita

Pero nunca sola, sola
Amores vienen y van, como las ola'
El DM explotao', to's le escriben "hola"
Una fila 'e cabrone' y yo quiero la cola, yeah, yeah, yeah

Dejame untarte el sunblock pa' que no te queme'

No sea' mala, me tienes de meme (Ey, ey, ey, ey)
Me siento como el sol, ey, cuando te pones sunblock (Cuando te pones sunblock)

Yo 'toy puesto pa' ti y tu te me quita'
Diablo, que piquete la chamaquita
El corazon lo puso en la neverita
Dice que este verano se queda solita

Pero nunca sola, sola
Amores vienen y van, como las ola'
Tu lo que ere' e' una abusadora
Vo'a buscarte una cerveza y bebe' el cora, yeah, yeah, yeah

I wanna take you somewhere so you know I care
But it's so cold and I don't know where
I brought you daffodils in a pretty string
But they won't flower like they did last spring
And I wanna kiss you, make you feel alright
I'm just so tired to share my nights
I wanna cry and I wanna love
But all my tears have been used up

On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up, up

And if somebody hurts you, I wanna fight
But my hands been broken one too many times
So I'll use my voice, I'll be so fucking rude
Words, they always win, but I know I'll lose
And I'd sing a song that'd be just ours
But I sang 'em all to another heart
And I wanna cry, I wanna learn to love
But all my tears have been used up

On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up, up

(Oh, need a love, now, my heart is thinking of)
I wanna sing a song that'd be just ours
But I sang 'em all to another heart
And I wanna cry, I wanna fall in love
But all my tears have been used up

On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up, up

Baby, ¿que mas?
Hace rato que no se na' de ti
'Taba con alguien, pero ya estoy free
Puesta pa' revivir viejos tiempos
No salgo hace tiempo
Tu dime donde estas
Que hace rato que no se na' de ti
'Taba con alguien, pero ya estoy free
Puesta pa' revivir viejos tiempos
No salgo hace tiempo

Papi, nos perdemos
Nos parqueamo' y lo prendemos
Pa' la seca algo bebemo'
Y cuando nos emborrachemo'
Una de reggaeton ponemos
Y nos vamo' adonde nos podamos querer
Nos podamos comer

¿Que de malo puede pasar?
¿Que nos vaya mal?
'Toy afuera, sal
Tenemos cosas pendientes por repasar
Tu eres un polvito dificil de reemplazar

No se si te convenza
Nos damo' un rocecito por Provenza
Y si la cosa se pone tensa
En mi cama es la recompensa o viceversa
¿Por que lo piensas?

Pasamos por el barrio por hierba
Ponlo en la hookah pa' que se disuelva
La quimica todavia se conserva
Y yo te lo hago rico para que vuelva'

Aunque manana me voy
Aprovechame, que aqui estoy
Puesta pa' ti
Por eso te escribi

Baby, ¿que mas?
Hace rato que no se na' de ti
'Taba con alguien, pero ya estoy free
Puesta pa' revivir viejos tiempos
No salgo hace tiempo
Tu dime donde estas

I wanna be your vacuum cleaner
Breathing in your dust
I wanna be your Ford Cortina
I will never rust
If you like your coffee hot
Let me be your coffee pot
You call the shots, babe
I just wanna be yours

Secrets I have held in my heart
Are harder to hide than I thought
Maybe I just wanna be yours
I wanna be yours, I wanna be yours
Wanna be yours, wanna be yours, wanna be yours

Let me be your 'leccy meter and I'll never run out
Let me be the portable heater that you'll get cold without
I wanna be your setting lotion (wanna be)
Hold your hair in deep devotion (how deep?)
At least as deep as the Pacific Ocean
I wanna be yours

Secrets I have held in my heart
Are harder to hide than I thought
Maybe I just wanna be yours
I wanna be yours, I wanna be yours
Wanna be yours, wanna be yours, wanna be yours
Wanna be yours, wanna be yours, wanna be yours
Wanna be yours, wanna be yours

I wanna be your vacuum cleaner (Wanna be yours)
Breathing in your dust (Wanna be yours)
I wanna be your Ford Cortina (Wanna be yours)
I will never rust (Wanna be yours)

I just wanna be yours (Wanna be yours)

Ever since the da-day y-you went away
(No, I don't know how)
How to erase your body from out my brain

She's alright
That girl's alright with me
Yeah

Ay, yo

I can lick it, I can ride it
While you slippin' and slidin'
I can do all them little tricks and keep the dick up inside it
You can smack it, you can grip it
You can go down and kiss it
And every time he leave me 'lone, he always tell me he miss it
He want a F-R-EEEEE-A-K
F-R-EEEEE-A-K, A-K, A-K, A-K
EEEEE-A-K
F-R-EEEEE-A-K

One thing about me, I'm the baddest alive
He know the prettiest bitch didn't come until I arrive
I don't let bitches get to me, I fuck they man if they try
I got a princess face, a killer body, samurai mind
They can't be Nicki, they so stupid, I just laugh when they try
A thong bikini up my ass, I think I'll go for a dive
His ex bitch went up against me, but she didn't survive
On applications I write, "Pressure", 'cause that's what I apply (Brrrr)
Pressure applied, can't fuck a regular guy
Wetter than umbrellas and stickier than Apple Pie

I can lick it, I can ride it
While you slippin' and slidin'
I can do all them little tricks and keep the dick up inside it
You can smack it, you can grip it
You can go down and kiss it
And every time he leave me 'lone, he always tell me he miss it
He want a F-R-EEEEE-A-K
F-R-EEEEE-A-K, A-K, A-K, A-K
EEEEE-A-K
F-R-EEEEE-A-K

'Cause what the fuck, this ain't Chanel, nigga, custom down?
Like, what the fuck, this ain't Burberry, custom brown?
He said, "Could you throw it back while you touch the ground?"
Then he said, "Do that pussy purr?" I said, "Yup, meow"
Hold up, fuck boys, ain't no need for you to roll up
Ain't no need for you to double tap neither, scroll up
Keep these bitches on they toes like Manolo
Be on the lookout when I come through, BOLO
Oh, whoa
Elegant bitch with a hoe glow
If it ain't big, then I won't blow
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe
Fuck is the tea? I just F'd a G
Make him say "Uhh", just ask Master P
Ball so hard, I just took a knee
Get me Rocky A$AP, nigga, word to RIH

Freak
F-f-freak
Some gyal a freak
Gyal a freak
Gyal a freak, freak, freak, freak

I can lick it, I can ride it
While you slippin' and slidin'
I can do all them little tricks and keep the dick up inside it
You can smack it, you can grip it
You can go down and kiss it
And every time he leave me 'lone, he always tell me he miss it
He want a F-R-EEEEE-A-K
F-R-EEEEE-A-K, A-K, A-K, A-K
EEEEE-A-K
F-R-EEEEE-A-K

Ra-Rauw

'Toy puesto pa' coger
Una nota cabrona
Explotar las cuentas
Y perrearme una culona

Despertar en otra cama
Que no sea la mia
Me importa un bicho mi ex
Si es tremenda porqueria

(Pero, ¿que carajos le pasa a este cabron?)

Hoy yo quiero coger una lokera
Coger una lokera
Guayar por toa la disco
Guayar por toa la disco
(Gua-guayar, guayar)
(Ay, 'toy bien loca, con la nota en high)
(Guayar, guayar)
(Ay, hoy yo no llego a casa de mi mai)

Ly-Ly-Ly-Ly (Guayar)

Tu estas Chuky
Cara linda, vision media puti
Tu gato te dejo sola en la disco
Cabron, que rookie

Ponte en cuatro, menea la' nalga'
Se ve el gistro debajo 'e la falda
En sacarmela no se tarda
Siempre dulce, nunca sabe amarga

Boto al novio, prefiere estar soltera
Ese Phillie nunca se queda afuera
Siempre con lo' condone' en la cartera
De la' hija' de puta fue la primera, yea-yea

(Ra-Rauw)

Hoy yo me escapo
Y me invento un plan, como el Chapo
Ella quiere amarrarse a un caco
De Carolina, un bellaco nato

Yo que falle, dudoso
Esta noche ando peligroso
Ella no e' mi esposa, pero la esposo
Me lo vio y dijo "Ay, que venoso"
(Wow, baby)

Hoy yo quiero coger una lokera
Coger una lokera
Guayar por toa la disco
Guayar por toa la disco
(Gua-guayar, guayar)
(Ay, 'toy bien loca, con la nota en high)
(Guayar, guayar)
(Ay, hoy yo no llego a casa de mi mai)

A mal momento, buena nota
No me responsabilizo cuando me explota
Voy pa' encimota a enchumbarme con una gota
Y si esto fuera Vina del Mar, ya tengo toa' la' gaviota'

Una que se va y otra' bendicione' que llegan
Hoy quiero una perra que lo mueva como Megan
Aqui misionamo' y la data no se riega
Chambonean, pero no me matan, como Omega

Necesito mas tiempo del que tengo
Ya todo me aburre y con nada me entretengo
Bajando las 1942 sin dividendo
No viven su vida y yo los entiendo

Miren de los bleachers, mi ex de metiche
Quiere que me encapriche pa' que me la chiche, chiche
Hace tiempo le apague el switche
No es que sea pitcher, es que prefiero bad bitches que berrinches (¡Sheesh!)

'Toy puesto pa' coger
Una nota cabrona
Explotar las cuentas
Y perrearme una culona

Despertar en otra cama
Que no sea la mia
Y mande al carajo a mi ex
Si es tremenda porqueria

(Gua-guayar)
(Ay, Un perreo con Lyanno, Rauw y Brray)
(Gua-guayar, guayar)
(Ay, vamo' pa' la cama, dime que hay)

Ey, no te quite', no te quite', no te quite'
Somo' unos bellacos
¡Calloway!

(Ahora no vengas a quitarte)
Me dijeron que ya no quiere' la' rosa' (No), que prefiere' la' botella' (Ah)
Despues que se entero, que la traiciono con la fulana aquella (La fulana aquella)
Ahora todo cambio, su vida cambio, el booty le crecio
Se hizo la' teta' y ma' se crecio
Yo, estoy que la rompo
Yo, estoy que te rompo

Como cuando te doy, ¿Viene' o voy?
Ella vive en Toy Story, subiendo stories con lo' toy
Va a perderse, aunque le suene el grillete
Y dejo al novio porque no esta por billete
No me importa cuanto gaste (No)
Pero valio la pena pa' tenerla desnuda en mi mente (¿Que?)
Pa' esa guerra yo me enliste (De una)
Y la gane, porque no te fuiste y te viniste
El que habla claro siempre gana, no el que engana ('Ta claro)
Y el que engana pierde, porque no habla claro
Yo siempre le hablo claro, ella me dice agua (Agua)
Porque soy transparente, y tambien porque mojo
Hici'te que pecara con lo' ojo'
¿Y quien resiste a tentacion con un antojo?
Hoy vo'a apagarte el fuego, voy vesti'o 'e rojo (Rojo)
Con la manguera voy a entrar por tu ventana
(¿Que?)
(Y baby, si quiere' mejor)

Pa', romperte como e', yo vo'a ensenarte, ma'
En to'a la' posicione' yo vo'a darte

Just awaken shaken once again, so you know it's on
Just awaken shaken once again, ho, you know it's on
Just awaken shaken once again, so you know it's on
Just awaken shaken once again, ho, you know it's on
Yeah, life
Life is the only thing we need
They need me to go, but I don't wanna leave
Rest in peace to Lil Keed


Fuck a pigeonhole, I'm a night owl, this a different mode
I might have to make her paint a 6 on her pinky toe
Heard you with a shooting guard, just let a nigga know
I would have you courtside, not the middle row
All good, love, in a minute, though
I can't stress about no bitch 'cause I'm a timid soul
Plus I'm cookin' up ambition on a kitchen stove
Pot start to bubble, see the suds, that shit good to go
Hoes say I'm suave, but I can't get RICO'd
Bro think he John Wayne, I bought him yellow stones
Love the way they hang, babe, fuck the silicone
Everybody fake now, you could crack the code
Bustdown everything, set in rose gold
Dread talkin' to you niggas like I'm J. Cole
I can tell her head good before I even know
Bitch, don't tell me that you model if you ain't been in Vogue
Gotta throw a party for my day ones
They ain't in the studio, but they'll lay somethin'
Rest in peace to Drama King, we was straight stuntin'
You don't like the way I talk? Nigga say somethin'
Gotta throw a party for my day ones
Pull up and you know it's us, the bass jumpin'
You don't like the way I talk? Then say somethin'
Get out my face, nigga


Gotta throw a party for my day ones
They ain't in the studio, but they'll lay somethin'
Rest in peace to Drama King, we was straight stuntin'
If I let my nigga 21 tell it, you a
(Pussy)


Spin a block twice like it ain't nowhere to park (21)
Smack the backside of his head like he Bart (Pussy)
OVO 4L, we come out when it get dark (21, 21)
Big stepper, he came in a Rolls, but he left in a stretcher (21)
Let my brother drive while I shoot, team effort (21)
Askin' all these questions, bitch, you must think you Nadeska
The chopper like to feel on all the opps, it's a molester (21)
I be with my gun like Rozay be with lemon pepper
She wanna hear some Afrobeats 'cause she just popped a Tesla
All that workin' out, that nigga must think he a wrestler
But this ain't UFC, this chopper came with a compressor (21)
This chopper came with a compressor (Pussy)
This chopper came with a (Pussy)
This Glock 45 came with a switch (21)
If I was Will Smith, I would've slapped him with a stick
Put your hands in the air, it's a stick-up (21)
Spin the same hood where I get my dick sucked (Facts)
If you standin' on business, put your blick up (21, 21)
Come around actin' scary, get your shit took (21)
Fell in love with feelin' dizzy, so I spizzin (21)
I got mad love for the boy, yeah, that's my twizzin (21)
If them niggas keep on dissin', slide agaizzin (21)
We the reason why the opps ain't got no frizziends (21)
Last nigga played with me got turned duppy
I ain't even roll him in the 'Wood 'cause he musty
You ask how she doin', I just tell her come and fuck me
Shot his ass twenty times, damn, this nigga lucky (Damn, that nigga lucky)


Gotta throw a party for my day ones
They ain't in the studio, but they'll lay somethin'
Rest in peace to Drama King, we was straight stuntin'
You don't like the way I talk, nigga, say somethin'

Say somethin', say somethin', say somethin', say somethin', say somethin'
You don't like the way I talk, nigga, say somethin', say somethin', say somethin', say somethin', say somethin'
---------------------------------------------------
Yeah

I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm going through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby

I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
Hey, hey, hey

I'm running out of time
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh

The city's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust

I'm just calling back to let you know (Back to let you know)
I could never say it on the phone (Say it on the phone)
Will never let you go this time (Ooh)

I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch

La melodia con la calle
Tony Dize

Baby, dame la senal
Si me sigues mirando asi te vo'a besar, te vo'a besar (Te vo'a besar)
Si es contigo no lo tengo que pensar (No, no)

Porque tu no eres como otra', no
Tu eres diferente (Eh, eh)
Viviendo la vida loca
Siempre en contra 'e la corriente
Hace' lo que a ti te de la gana, gana, ah-ah-ah
Siempre pichea', meno' si el perreo llama (Jeje), llama, ah-ah-ah (Ey, ey)

Quiero que tu me ensene', que sea' mi teacher, jeje
Una bitch, una pitcher, ey
Lowkey, anda a switche, je
Loca que me la chi
Ey, ey, la baby ya va pa' treinta y se ve violenta, se ve violenta
Hace rato esta mirando, me di cuenta, ya me di cuenta, ah-ah
Ella sabe ma' que tu, asi que no sea' tonto, chico, no le mienta', je
No te vivas la pelicula, que ella es la pelicula y de las que no se renta
Sube ese culo y to's comentan
Una bad bitch, girl de lo' 90
Esa carita agridulce es lo que me tienta
Una picky, una menta
Pa' mamartela y rompertela
Bajo pa' tu cancha y wachartela
Si tu amiga quiere, ve, invitala
Ve, invitala, que se va a hacer

Pero yo no quiero a otra, no
Tu eres diferente
Si tu fuera' una ola, pues que me lleve la corriente
Tu hace' lo que a ti te de la gana, gana, ah-ah-ah
Siempre pichea, meno' si el perreo llama, llama, ah-ah-ah (Ey)

Tu eres de las que sale
Tarde en la noche, pero sin dejarse ver (No, no)
Se dejo y no va a volver (Nah, nah)
Ahora esta mejor soltera
Sale sin hora de llegada, no le dicen nada
Hace lo que quiera (Hace lo que quiera)
La calle prendia' en candela (Ey, ey)
Y antes de enfangarse, prefiere a solas acostarse, eh, eh
Parece colombiana, le dicen "la parce"
No necesita un hombre, pa' ti hay que buscarse
Ella se la vive bailando, oh, oh
Tiene a to' la disco mirando, eh, eh

Porque tu no eres como otras, no
Tu eres diferente (Ey, ey)
Viviendo la vida loca (Viviendo la vida loca)
Siempre en contra la corriente (Ey, ey)
Tu hace' lo que a ti te de la gana, gana, ah-ah-ah
Siempre pichea', meno' si el perreo llama, llama, ah-ah-ah

Yeah-yeah, ey, je

It doesn't hurt me
Do you wanna feel how it feels?
Do you wanna know, know that it doesn't hurt me?
Do you wanna hear about the deal that I'm making?
You, it's you and me

And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
Say, if I only could, ooh

You don't wanna hurt me
But see how deep the bullet lies
Unaware I'm tearing you asunder
Ooh, there is thunder in our hearts

Is there so much hate for the ones we love?
Oh, tell me, we both matter, don't we?
You, it's you and me
It's you and me won't be unhappy

And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
Say, if I only could, ooh

You
It's you and me
It's you and me won't be unhappy

Oh, come on, baby. Oh, come on, darling
Let me steal this moment from you now
Oh, come on, angel. Come on, come on, darling
Let's exchange the experience, ooh

And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
I'd be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problems

Say, if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problems

So if I only could
And make a deal with God
I'd get him to swap our places
I'd be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problems

So if I only could
Be running up that hill
With no problems

If I only could, be running up that hill
If I only could, be running up that hill

Can I be honest?
I still want your hands up on my body
You still make my heart beat fast, Ferrari

Uf, que chimba un verso de Maldy

Sin Maldy no hay perreo

Yo la aprete
En la disco como nadie la apreto
Gatita mansa pero gatita se me revelo
Me dijo que
El alcohol todo el miedo se lo quito
Que debajo 'e la falda
Nadie sabe si usa panty o no
Bellaqueo es lo que quiere
Bellaqueo es lo que exije
No me eches la culpa
Yo te dije
Que yo ando en la nota bien virao
Y a ti nadie te corrige
Llegale a casa pa' que te acobije
Que te quiero dar masacote
Pa' que esas nalgas reboten
Ella me lo tiene grandote
Como te encanta Chimbote
Tu eres adicta y cachonda
Te gusta que te lo roce
Como la cancion de Yankee: "Rompe, Rompe"

Estaba loca por probarte
Darte los besitos yo
Ojala puedas quedarte
Porque asi me quedo yo
Estaba loca por casarte
Hacertelo rico yo
Ojala puedas quedarte
Porque aqui me quedo yo
Cuando te pongo el panty de laito
Porque aqui me quedo yo
Yo dandote besito' alla abajito

Oye, esta vez junto a la bichota, Karol G
La Bebesuki
Con este servidor, Maldy
Sin Maldy no hay perreo

Late night telephone
Calling all the wallflowers I know
Out the dark and into the light
Half love, half regret
Dressing up for polaroids and cigarettes
Socialize, romanticize the life

Floating on my low key vibe
Floating on my low key vibe, vibe, vibe
I don't need that late night high
I'm floating on my vibe
Vibe, vibe, vibe, vibe, vibe

Bulletproof passengers
On the road to sex, drugs, et cetera
Get out the dark and into the light
Everywhere I go I know that I don't want to be
Part of something I won't ever need;
Your socialized, romanticized life

Floating on my low key vibe
Floating on my low key vibe, vibe, vibe
I don't need that late night high
I'm floating on my vibe
Vibe, vibe, vibe, vibe, vibe

Out of touch in harmony
Designer drugs from dead end streets
Break the air to feel the fall
Or just feel anything at all

Floating on my low key vibe
Floating on my low key vibe, vibe, vibe
I don't need that late night high
I'm floating on my vibe
Vibe, vibe, vibe, vibe, vibe

Floating on my low key vibe
Floating on my low key vibe, vibe, vibe
I don't need that late night high
I'm floating on my vibe
Vibe, vibe, vibe, vibe, vibe
I'm floating on my

Two fingers up, one down with my toes ten
Flewed out with my boobs out, put a cork in it

I don't think he gon' make it
Do not let me start ragin'
Bitch, I'm losin' my patience
This ain't stayin' in Vegas (You ain't nothing but a)

There's more sides to the story, I'ma tell everybody
Had your ass sittin' courtside with your arm around me
Had your ass sittin' first class with your burnt ass out in Abu Dhabi
Could've been what we should've been but you lost a bet, now you gotta find me
Find a seat, nigga

I get it, you needed someone that could prove you wrong
So I reckon, you leave all of your problems at the door to my city
You gon' need to tell my brothers where you from
And I admit it, I still got empathy
And you gon' feel it for two weeks
When I release you in them sheets (You ain't nothing but a)
And keep my meaning discreet
Keep the clean in my Jeep
And put that Yeezy in your teeth
Let my demons off their leashes
If you even think to speak
I'ma give a whole new meaning
When you said you live in a dream
We can keep that shit asleep
And you gon' laugh with all your Gs
Countin' them sheep, sheep, sheep
Talkin' 'bout Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z, R-I-P

Dog, player, ah, get it
Fraud, player, ah, get it

---------------------------------------------------
Por completarte me rompi en pedazos
Me lo advirtieron, pero no hice caso
Me di cuenta que lo tuyo es falso
Fue la gota que rebaso el vaso

No me digas que lo sientes
Eso parece sincero pero te conozco bien y se que mientes

Te felicito, que bien actuas
De eso no me cabe duda
Con tu papel, continua
Te queda bien ese show

Te felicito, que bien actuas
De eso no me cabe duda
Con tu papel, continua
Te queda bien ese show

Te felicito, que bien actuas

Esa filosofia barata no la compro
Lo siento, en esa moto ya no me monto
La gente de dos caras no la soporto
Yo que ponia las manos al fuego por ti

Y me tratas como uno mas
De tus-an-tojos
Tu herida no me abrio la piel, pero si los ojos
Los-ten-go rojos
De tanto llorar por ti

Y ahora resulta que lo sientes
Suena sincero pero te conozco bien y se que mientes

Te felicito, que bien actuas
De eso no me cabe duda
Con tu papel, continua
Te queda bien ese show

Te felicito, que bien actuas
De eso no me cabe duda
Con tu papel, continua
Te queda bien ese show

Te felicito, que bien actuas

Dice
Ra-Rauw
Hablandote claro, no te necesito
Perdiste alguien autentico
Algo me decia por que no fluiamos
Te voy a picar cuando recuerdes como nos comiamos

Como antes
Tu espalda apoyandote del volante
Te mando el tranquilizante
No te bloquee de las redes para que veas la otra en la Mercedes

No me cuentes mas historias, no quiero saber
Como es que he sido tan ciega, no he podido ver
Te deberia dar un Oscar, lo has hecho tan bien

Te felicito, que bien actuas
De eso no me cabe duda
Con tu papel, continua
Te queda bien ese show

Te felicito, que bien actuas
De eso no me cabe duda
Con tu papel, continua
Te queda bien ese show

Te felicito, que bien actuas

Don't ever say it's over if I'm breathin'
Racin' to the moonlight and I'm speedin'
I'm headed to the stars, ready to go far
I'm star walkin'
Don't ever say it's over if I'm breathin'
Racin' to the moonlight and I'm speedin'
I'm headed to the stars, ready to go far
I'm star walkin'

On the mission to get high up
I know that I'ma die reachin' for a life that I don't really need at all
Never listened to replies, learned a lesson from the wise

You should never take advice from a nigga that ain't try
They said I wouldn't make it out alive
They told me I would never see the rise
That's why I gotta kill 'em every time (Gotta watch 'em bleed, too)

Don't ever say it's over if I'm breathin'
Racin' to the moonlight and I'm speedin'
I'm headed to the stars, ready to go far
I'm star walkin'
Don't ever say it's over if I'm breathin'
Racin' to the moonlight and I'm speedin'
I'm headed to the stars, ready to go far
I'm star walkin'

Been that nigga since I came out my momma (Woo)
Thankin' God daddy never wore a condom (Woo)
Prove 'em wrong every time 'til it's normal
Why worship legends when you know that you can join 'em?
Th-These niggas don't like me, they don't like me
Likely, they wanna fight me
Come on, try it out, try me
They put me down, but I never cried out
Why me?
Word from the wise:

Don't put worth inside a nigga that ain't try
They said I wouldn't make it out alive
They told me I would never see the rise
That's why I gotta kill 'em every time (Gotta watch 'em bleed, too)

Don't ever say it's over if I'm breathin'
Racin' to the moonlight and I'm speedin'
I'm headed to the stars, ready to go far
I'm star walkin'
Don't ever say it's over if I'm breathin'
Racin' to the moonlight and I'm speedin'
I'm headed to the stars, ready to go far
I'm star walkin'

Star walkin'

Don't ever say it's over if I'm breathin'
Racin' to the moonlight and I'm speedin'
I'm headed to the stars, ready to go far
I'm star walkin'

The birds have left their trees
The light pours onto me
I can feel you lying there all on your own
We got here the hard way
All those words that we exchange
Is it any wonder things get broke?

Cause in my heart and in my head
I'll never take back the things I said
So high above, I feel it coming down
She said, in my heart and in my head
Tell me why this has to end
Oh, no, oh, no

I can't save us, my Atlantis, we fall
We built this town on shaky ground
I can't save us, my Atlantis, oh, no
We built it up to pull it down

Now all the birds have fled
The hurt just leaves me scared
Losing everything I've ever known
It's all become too much
Maybe I'm not built for love
If I knew that I could reach you, I would go

It's in my heart and in my head
You can't take back the things you said
So high above, I feel it coming down
She said, in my heart and in my head
Tell me why this has to end
Oh, no, oh, no

I can't save us, my Atlantis, we fall
We built this town on shaky ground
I can't save us, my Atlantis, oh, no
We built it up to pull it down

And we build it up and we build it up
And we build it up to pull it down
And we build it up and we build it up
And we build it up to pull it down

I can't save us, my Atlantis, we fall
We built this town on shaky ground
I can't save us, my Atlantis, oh, no
We built it up to pull it down

I summoned you, please come to me
Don't bury thoughts that you really want
I fill you up, drink from my cup
Within me lies what you really want

Come, lay me down
'Cause you know this
'Cause you know this sound

In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
Just call my name
I'm yours to tame
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
I'm wide awake
I crave your taste all night long
'Til morning comes
I'm getting what is mine
You gon' get yours, oh no, ooh
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night, oh

These burning flames, these crashing waves
Wash over me like a hurricane
I captivate, you're hypnotized
Feel powerful, but it's me again

Come, lay me down
'Cause I know this
'Cause I know this sound

In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
Just call my name
I'm yours to tame
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
I'm wide awake
I crave your taste all night long
'Til morning comes
I'm getting what is mine
You gon' get yours, oh no, ooh
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night, oh

Just call on me, ah
Just call my name
Like you mean it, ah

In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
Just call my name
I'm yours to tame
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
I'm wide awake
I crave your taste all night long
'Til morning comes
I'm getting what is mine
You gon' get yours, oh
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night, oh

Maybe it's the way you say my name
Maybe it's the way you play your game
But it's so good, I've never known anybody like you
But it's so good, I've never dreamed of nobody like you

And I've heard of a love that comes once in a lifetime
And I'm pretty sure that you are that love of mine

'Cause I'm in a field of dandelions
Wishing on every one that you'd be mine, mine
And I see forever in your eyes
I feel okay when I see you smile, smile

Wishing on dandelions all of the time
Praying to God that one day you'll be mine
Wishing on dandelions all of the time, all of the time

I think that you are the one for me
Cause it gets so hard to breathe
When you're looking at me
I've never felt so alive and free
When you're looking at me
I've never felt so happy

And I've heard of a love that comes once in a lifetime
And I'm pretty sure that you are that love of mine

Cause I'm in a field of dandelions
Wishing on every one that you'd be mine, mine
And I see forever in your eyes
I feel okay when I see you smile, smile

Wishing on dandelions all of the time
Praying to God that one day you'll be mine
Wishing on dandelions all of the time, all of the time

Dandelion into the wind you go
Won't you let my darling know?
Dandelion into the wind you go
Won't you let my darling know that

I'm in a field of dandelions
Wishing on every one that you'd be mine, mine
And I see forever in your eyes
I feel okay when I see you smile, smile

Wishing on dandelions all of the time
Praying to God that one day you'll be mine
Wishing on dandelions all of the time, all of the time

I'm in a field of dandelions
Wishing on every one that you'd be mine, mine

What makes a grown man wanna cry?
(Cry, cry, cry, cry)
What makes him wanna take his life?
(Yeah)
His happiness is never real
(Real, real, real, real)
And mindless sex is how he feels, ooh, he heals

When it's time, when it's time, when it's time
It won't matter (it don't matter)
It won't matter (matter)
When it's time, when it's time, when it's time (time, it's time, babe)
It won't matter (it won't matter, babe)

It was like he was gone in thin air, oh
When it's time, when it's time, when it's time, oh, baby
It won't matter (It won't matter, baby)
It won't matter

When it's time, when it's time, when it's time
It won't matter
It won't matter
When it's time, when it's time, when it's time
It won't matter
It won't matter
It was like he was never there
It was like he was gone in thin air
When it's time, when it's time, when it's time
It won't matter, it won't matter

When it's time, when it's time, when it's time
It won't matter, it won't matter
When it's time, when it's time, when it's time
It won't matter, it won't matter

Ooh, now I know what love is
And I know it ain't you for sure
You'd rather something toxic
So, I poison myself again, again
'Til I feel nothing
In my soul (in my soul)
I'm on the edge of something breaking
I feel my mind is slowly fading
If I keep going, I won't make it
If I keep going, I won't make it

And it's all because of you
It's all because of you
It's all because of you
It's all because of you
Whoa, whoa
Don't you, baby, hey
It won't matter, baby
Don't you know?
Don't you know?
Oh, ooh, oh
Hey!

I'm tryna put you in the worst mood, ah
P1 cleaner than your church shoes, ah
Milli point two just to hurt you, ah
All red lamb just to tease you, ah
None of these toys on lease too, ah
Made your whole year in a week too, yeah
Main bitch out of your league too, ah
Side bitch out of your league too, ah

House so empty, need a centerpiece
Twenty racks, a table cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby
You talking money, need a hearing aid
You talking 'bout me, I don't see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain

Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Look what you've done!

Every day a nigga try to test me, ah
Every day a nigga try to end me, ah
Pull off in that roadster SV, ah
Pockets over weight getting hefty, ah
Coming for the king, that's a far cry
I come alive in the fall time I
No competition, I don't really listen
I'm in the blue Mulsanne bumping New Edition

House so empty, need a centerpiece
Twenty racks, a table cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces

Let a nigga brag Pitt
Legend of the fall took the year like a bandit
Bought mama a crib and a brand new wagon
Now she hit the grocery shop looking lavish
Star Trek roof in that Wraith of Khan
Girls get loose when they hear this song
Hundred on the dash get me close to God
We don't pray for love, we just pray for cars

House so empty, need a centerpiece
Twenty racks, a table cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby
You talking money, need a hearing aid
You talking 'bout me, I don't see the shade

Georgia, wrap me up in all your...
I want you, in my arms
Oh, let me hold you
I'll never let you go again, like I did
Oh, I used to say

"I would never fall in love again, until I found her"
I said, "I would never fall, unless it's you I fall into"
I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her
I found you

Georgia, pulled me in, I asked to...
Love her, once again
You fell, I caught you
I'll never let you go again, like I did
Oh, I used to say

"I would never fall in love again, until I found her"
I said, "I would never fall, unless it's you I fall into"
I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her
I found you

"I would never fall in love again, until I found her"
I said, "I would never fall, unless it's you I fall into"
I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her
I found you

One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need

Let me take the night, I love real easy
And I know that you'll still wanna see me
On the Sunday morning, music real loud
Let me love you while the moon is still out

Something in you
Lit up heaven in me
The feeling won't let me sleep
'Cause I'm lost in the way you move, the way you feel

One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need

One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need

I just want to feel your skin on mine
Feel your eyes do the exploring
Passion in the message when you smile
Take my time

It's something in you
Lit up heaven in me
The feeling won't let me sleep
'Cause I'm lost in the way you move, the way you feel

One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me

Hold me closer
Hold me closer
Hold me closer
Hold me closer

Saw you dancing out the ocean
Running fast along the sand
A spirit born of earth and water
Fire flying from your hands

Oh

Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today

Oh

Hold me closer
Hold me closer (Hold me closer)
Hold me closer
Hold me closer

There are caravans we follow
Drunken nights in dark hotels (Baby)
When chances breathe between the silence
When sex and love no longer gel

Oh

Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway (Baby)
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today

Hold me closer
Hold me closer (Baby, baby)
Hold me closer
Hold me closer (Oh yeah)

Hold me closer
Hold me closer
(Hold me closer, me closer) Hold me closer
(Me closer, mm, yeah) Hold me closer
---------------------------------------------------
Ooh
Na-na, yeah

I saw you dancing in a crowded room (Uh)
You look so happy when I'm not with you
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eye

I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away

You could've asked me why I broke your heart
You could've told me that you fell apart
But you walked past me like I wasn't there
And just pretended like you didn't care

I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away

Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
Save your tears for another day
Save your tears for another day (So)

I made you think that I would always stay
I said some things that I should never say
Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine
And now you won't love me for a second time

I don't know why I run away, oh, girl
Said, I make you cry when I run away

Girl, take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
I realize that I'm much too late
And you deserve someone better
Save your tears for another day (Oh yeah)
Save your tears for another day (Yeah)

I don't know why I run away
I'll make you cry when I run away

Save your tears for another day
Ooh, girl, I said (Ah)
Save your tears for another day (Ah)

Save your tears for another day (Ah)
Save your tears for another day (Ah)

Que rico seria
Intercambiar energias
Prender sin decir buenos dias
Hacer el amor y despues preguntarte

Como dormiste bebe?
Si me sonaste
Quiero saber si con mas ganas despertaste

Como dormiste bebe?
Si me sonaste
Quiero saber si con mas ganas de mmm

Mami respect
Ese culo tu lo mueves nivel expert
Hecha de laboratorio como Dexter
Y vivir dentro de ti mami quiero ser tu huesped

So fresh so juicy so clean
Eso de abajo se lo sobo con cream
Sabe que pasa si le quito ese jean
Se le queda el cachete rojo Supreme

A ella le gusta agresivo
Que la calienten con dembow
Y yo soy fan de ese pussy rose
La puse a gritar se quedo sin voz

En la calle una dama
Pero pone cara de puta cuando me lo mama
A mi no pero a mi bicho lo ama
Perdona la groseria, se me olvida preguntarte

Como dormiste bebe?
Si me sonaste
Quiero saber si con mas ganas despertaste

Como dormiste bebe?
Si me sonaste
Quiero saber si con mas ganas de mmm
---------------------------------------------------
Yeah
Yeah-yeah
Yeah

Todo parece estar bien
Pero nada e' lo que parece
No supe darte mi cien
Aunque lo trate muchas vece'
Lo intente, pero fracace
Todos mis errore' ya los repase
Y ahora dime como duerme si tu no me pertenece' (No-oh)
Abuelo me lo dijo, el amor no funciona
Quien meno' te espera' se va y te traiciona
Te fuiste sin despedirte
Como si nunca me quisiste

Te di lo que pedia' y no fue suficiente
Tu solo mentia' y yo tu fiel creyente
Mil sueno' me vendia', yo fui tu cliente (Yo')
Siempre era yo el culpable y tu jugando a la inocente (Suena, wow)

Tu callaita' chequeando mis mensaje'
Y yo al garete llevandote de viaje
Una nebula, todo era un visaje
Te fuiste d ecasa y sacaste tu equipaje
Nadie te va amar como yo ni va a chingarte como yo
Y ahora quiere que me quede tranquilo si un hijueputa me choteo
En medio de esta situacion, no me duele el corazon
Me duele que le haya' creido algo mio a otro cabron
Que te tiraba to'a la noche
Se te olvido que saldamo' to' mi coche
To' los mese' un nuevo perfume
Hasta te compraba pasto pa' que fume', bebe
No quiero que nada te falte
Y ojala que ese cabron te pague el esmalte, yeah-yeah
Yo no te deseo el mal, pero vas a pensar en mi cada ve' que te levantes (Wow)

Te di lo que pedia' y no fue suficiente
Tu solo mentia' y yo tu fiel creyente
Mil sueno' me vendia', yo fui tu cliente
Siempre era yo el culpable y tu jugando a la inocente

Tu me vendiste sueno' y yo fui tu cliente
Esa carita de inocente
Solo te la cree el resto de la gente
Quiza soy masoquista o solo tengo mala suerte
Le pido a Dio', a ver si contigo me ayuda
No pienso llamarte, te aclaro la duda
Yo quiero ser libre igual que Venezuela y Cuba
Nunca hablaste claro, te hiciste la muda
Queria' atencion y yo te puse en el centro
Queria' mi corazon y te lo puse en descuento
Me pediste el cincuenta y yo te di 100%
Me pediste un reloj y yo perdiendo mi tiempo
Me quede esperando que tu mensaje llegara
Me comi otro culo, pero pensando en tu cara
Quedate con la culpa y tambien con la ropa cara
Y recuerda que la traicion, con traicion se paga

Te di lo que pedia' y no fue suficiente
Tu solo mentia' y yo tu fiel creyente
Mil sueno' me vendia', yo fui tu cliente
Siempre era yo el culpable y tu jugando a la inocente
---------------------------------------------------
Gimme, gimme, gimme some time to think
I'm in the bathroom, looking at me
Face in the mirror is all I need (ooh)
Wait until the reaper takes my life
Never gonna get me out alive
I will live a thousand million lives (ooh)

My patience is waning
Is this entertaining?
Our patience is waning
Is this entertaining?

I-I-I got this feeling, yeah, you know
Where I'm losing all control
'Cause there's magic in my bones
I-I-I got this feeling in my soul
Go ahead and throw your stones
'Cause there's magic in my bones

Playing with a stick of dynamite
There was never gray in black and white
There was never wrong 'til there was right (ooh, oh)
Feeling like a boulder hurtling
Seeing all the vultures circling
Burning in the flames I'm working in
Turning in a bed that's darkening

My patience is waning
Is this entertaining?
Our patience is waning
Is this entertaining?

I-I-I got this feeling, yeah, you know
Where I'm losing all control
'Cause there's magic in my bones (in my bones)
I-I-I got this feeling in my soul
Go ahead and throw your stones
'Cause there's magic in my bones

'Cause there's magic in my bones

Look in the mirror of my mind
Turning the pages of my life
Walking the path so many paced a million times
Drown out the voices in the air
Leaving the ones that never cared
Picking the pieces up and building to the sky

My patience is waning
Is this entertaining?
My patience is waning
Is this entertaining?

I-I-I got this feeling, yeah, you know
Where I'm losing all control
'Cause there's magic in my bones (magic in my bones)
I-I-I got this feeling in my soul (soul)
Go ahead and throw your stones
'Cause there's magic in

There goes my mind (I-I-I)
Don't mind
There goes my mind (there it goes, there it goes)
There goes my mind (I-I-I)
Don't mind (there it goes)
There goes my mind
'Cause there's magic in my bones
---------------------------------------------------
It'll be fine by dusk light, I'm tellin' you, baby
These things eat at your bones and drive your young mind crazy
But when you place your head between my collar and jaw
I don't know much, but there's no weight at all

And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't
'Cause if I say I miss you, I know that you won't
But I miss you in the mornings when I see the sun
Somethin' in the orange tells me we're not done

To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home

I need to hear you say you've been waitin' all night
There's orange dancin' in your eyes from bulb light
Your voice only trembles when you try to speak
Take me back to us dancin', this wood used to creak

To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home

To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home
If you leave today, I'll just stare at the way
The orange touches all things around
The grass, trees, and dew, how I just hate you
Please turn those headlights around
Please turn those headlights around
---------------------------------------------------
Anyway

It's bad bitch o'clock, yeah, it's thick-thirty
I've been through a lot, but I'm still flirty (Okay)
Is everybody back up in the buildin'?
It's been a minute, tell me how you're healin'
'Cause I'm about to get into my feelings
How you feelin'? How you feel right now?

Oh, I been so down and under pressure
I'm way too fine to be this stressed, yeah

Turn up the music, let's celebrate (Alright)
I got a feelin' I'm gon' be okay
Okay (Okay), alright

In a minute, I'ma need a sentimental
Man or woman to pump me up
Feelin' fussy, walkin' in my Balenci-ussies
Tryna bring out the fabulous
'Cause I give a fuck way too much
I'ma need like two shots in my cup
Wanna get up, wanna get down
Mm, that's how I feel right now

Oh, I been so down and under pressure
I'm way too fine to be this stressed, yeah
Oh, I'm not the girl I was or used to be, uh

It's about damn time
---------------------------------------------------
Bitch, I'm stylish
Glock tucked, big t-shirt, Billie Eilish
Watch on my wrist, but I want that in diamonds
Niggas talkin' crazy, when I pull up, it's silent
Mile high, run that shit back, bitch, I'm stylish
Glock tucked, big t-shirt, Billie Eilish
Watch on my wrist, but I want that in diamonds
Niggas talkin' crazy, when I pull up, it's silent
Mile high, fuck a first-class, I'm the pilot

Put it in perspective
Bitch, I got everything I wanted and some extra
I am not the type for turning into a detective (damn)
Got two of my own phones, barely even check 'em
Uber Eats the food, I don't call, I just text it
Cashed out on bail, my lil' bitch got arrested
Flexed out my Lexus, no backseats and no besties
I checked it, no guest list, so don't text me (Hold on)
Ayy, two pistols, thirties in the clip, these akimbos
Open hand, smack him in his mitt, bitch, I'm Kimbo
You be throwing cash in the strip
My lil' bitch suckin' dick for the free
I got a bitch, but a bitch ain't got me
I know she trip when I dip, so I creep
These bitches pillow talkin' 'bout me like I'm sleep
But she ain't know this Gen3 was in my motherfucking tee

Bitch, I'm stylish
Glock tucked, big t-shirt, Billie Eilish
Propped up, fucking it from the back on an island
Heard they talkin' crazy 'bout my name, now it's silent
Mile high, run that shit back-

Bitch, I'm stylish
Glock tucked, big t-shirt, Billie Eilish
Watch on my wrist, but I want that in diamonds
Niggas talkin' crazy, when I pull up, it's silent
Mile high, run that shit back, bitch, I'm stylish
Glock tucked, big t-shirt, Billie Eilish
Watch on my wrist, but I want that in diamonds
Niggas talkin' crazy, when I pull up, it's silent
Mile high, fuck a first-class, I'm the pilot
---------------------------------------------------
I just need someone in my life to give it structure
To handle all the selfish ways I'd spend my time without her
You're everything I want, but I can't deal with all your lovers
Saying I'm the one, but it's your actions that speak louder
Giving me love when you are down and need another
I've got to get away and let you go, I've got to get over

But I love you so
I love you so
I love you so
I love you so

I'm gonna pack my things and leave you behind
This feeling's old and I know that I've made up my mind
I hope you feel what I felt when you shattered my soul
'Cause you were cruel and I'm a fool
So please let me go

But I love you so (please let me go)
I love you so (please let me go)
I love you so (please let me go)
I love you so
---------------------------------------------------
Thought I found a way
Thought I found a way out (found)
But you never go away (never go away)
So I guess I gotta stay now

Oh, I hope someday I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear

Isn't it lovely? All alone
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home

Walking out of time
Looking for a better place (looking for a better place)
Something's on my mind
Always in my head space

But I know someday I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive outside I can't fight my fear

Isn't it lovely? All alone
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello. Welcome home

Whoa, yeah
Yeah, ah
Whoa, whoa
Hello, welcome home
---------------------------------------------------
I do the same thing I told you that I never would
I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could
Know that I can't find nobody else as good as you
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey (Oh)

I get drunk, wake up, I'm wasted still
I realize the time that I wasted here
I feel like you can't feel the way I feel
Oh, I'll be fucked up if you can't be right here

Oh, ooh-whoa (Oh, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa)
Oh, ooh-whoa (Oh, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa)
Oh, ooh-whoa (Oh, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa)
Oh, I'll be fucked up if you can't be right here

I do the same thing I told you that I never would
I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could
Know that I can't find nobody else as good as you
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey
I do the same thing I told you that I never would
I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could
Know that I can't find nobody else as good as you
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey

When I'm away from you, I miss your touch (Ooh)
You're the reason I believe in love
It's been difficult for me to trust (Ooh)
And I'm afraid that I'ma fuck it up
Ain't no way that I can leave you stranded
'Cause you ain't never left me empty-handed
And you know that I know that I can't live without you
So, baby, stay

Oh, ooh-whoa (Oh, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa)
Oh, ooh-whoa (Oh, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa)
Oh, ooh-whoa (Oh, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa)
I'll be fucked up if you can't be right here

I do the same thing I told you that I never would
I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could
Know that I can't find nobody else as good as you
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey
I do the same thing I told you that I never would
I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could
Know that I can't find nobody else as good as you
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey

Whoa-oh
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey
---------------------------------------------------
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
'Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long, that
Even my momma thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how you talkin' and where you walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke, fool
I'm the kinda G the little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the streetlight

Been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise

Look at the situation they got me facin'
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the state
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watchin' got me chasin' dreams
I'm a educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set trippin' banger
And my homies is down so don't arouse my anger
Fool, death ain't nothin' but a heart beat away
I'm livin' life do or die, what can I say?
I'm 23 now, but will I live to see 24?
The way things is goin' I don't know

Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?

Been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise

Power and the money, money and the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's runnin', but half of them ain't lookin'
It's goin' on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'
They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
I guess they can't, I guess they won't
I guess they frontin', that's why I know my life is out of luck, fool!

Been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise

Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?
Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?
---------------------------------------------------
Tastes like strawberries on a summer evenin'
And it sounds just like a song
I want more berries and that summer feelin'
It's so wonderful and warm

Breathe me in, breathe me out
I don't know if I could ever go without
I'm just thinking out loud
I don't know if I could ever go without

Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar

Strawberries on a summer evenin'
Baby, you're the end of June
I want your belly and that summer feelin'
Getting washed away in you

Breathe me in, breathe me out
I don't know if I could ever go without

Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high

I just wanna taste it, I just wanna taste it
Watermelon sugar high

Tastes like strawberries on a summer evenin'
And it sounds just like a song
I want your belly and that summer feelin'
I don't know if I could ever go without

Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high (Sugar)
Watermelon sugar high (Sugar)
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high

I just wanna taste it, I just wanna taste it (Woo)
Watermelon sugar high
I just wanna taste it, I just wanna taste it (Ooh)
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar

I will wait for you, for you
Early in the mornin', late at night (I will wait for you)
It doesn't even matter what time it is (I will wait for you)
Presidential Rollie already on the way (Tired, sayin', "Aye, yi, yi, yi")
Whenever I find time, it's okay (Ayy)
ATL Jacob, ATL Jacob

You pray for my demons, girl, I got you
Every time I sip on codeine, I get vulnerable
I'm knowin' the sounds of the storm when it come
She understand I can't take her everywhere a nigga going
I been in the field like the children of the corn

I can hear your tears when they drop over the phone
Get mad at yourself 'cause you can't leave me alone
Gossip, bein' messy, that ain't what we doing (World was ending)
Travel around the world (Would you cry or would you try to get me?)
Over the phone, dropping tears (Tell me now, I want you to be clear, yeah)
I get more vulnerable when I do pills (Tell me now, I need you to be clear, yeah)
When you drunk, you tell me exactly how you feel (I will wait for you, for you)
When I'm loaded, I keep it real (I will wait for you, I will wait for you)
Please tell a real one exactly what it is (I will wait, will wait, for you, for you)
Don't say it 'cause you know that's what I wanna hear (I will wait for you, I will wait for you)

Yeah, I been trappin' 'round the world
I sit on my balcony and wonder how you feelin'
I got a career that takes my time away from women
I cannot convince you that I love you for a livin' (Will wait for you, for you)
I be on your line, feelings flowin' like a river
You be textin' back you at Kiki on the river (I will wait for you)
Message say delivered (I will wait for you), but I know that you don't get it
Why you introduce us if you knew that you was with him? (I will wait for you, for you, for you)
Made me shake his hand when y'all been fuckin' for a minute (I will wait for you, for you)
Walk me off the plank because you know that I'm a swimmer (I will wait for you)
Supposed to be your dog, but you done put me in a kennel
Girl, put a muzzle on it, all that barkin' over dinner
I was fuckin' with you when you had the tiny Presidential
You got better when you met me and that ain't coincidental
Tried to bring the best out you but, guess I'm not that influential
Guess I'm not the one that's meant for you

I can hear your tears when they drop over the phone
Get mad at myself 'cause I can't leave You alone
Gossip, bein' messy, that ain't what we doing, yeah (World was ending)
Trappin' around the world (Would you cry or would you try to get me?)
Over the phone, dropping tears (Tell me now, I want you to be clear, yeah)
I get more vulnerable when I do pills (Tell me now, I need you to be clear, yeah)
When you drunk, you tell me exactly how you feel (I will wait for you, for you)
When I'm loaded, I keep it real (I will wait for you, I will wait for you)
Please tell a real one exactly what it is (I will wait, will wait, for you, for you)
Don't say it 'cause you know that's what I wanna hear (I will wait for you)

Early in the mornin', late at night
It don't even matter what time it is
World was ending, would you cry or would you try to get me?
Tell me now, I want you to be clear, yeah
Tell me now
---------------------------------------------------
We found each other
I helped you out of a broken place
You gave me comfort
But falling for you was my mistake

I put you on top, I put you on top
I claimed you so proud and openly
And when times were rough, when times were rough
I made sure I held you close to me

So call out my name (call out my name)
Call out my name when I kiss you so gently
I want you to stay (want you to stay)
I want you to stay, even though you don't want me
Girl, why can't you wait? (Why can't you wait, baby?)
Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of love?
Won't you call out my name? (Call out my name)
Girl, call out my name, and I'll be on my way and
I'll be on my

I said I didn't feel nothing, baby, but I lied
I almost cut a piece of myself for your life
Guess I was just another pit stop
'Til you made up your mind
You just wasted my time

You were on top, I put you on top
I claimed you so proud and openly, babe
And when times were rough, when times were rough
I made sure I held you close to me!

So call out my name (call out my name, baby)
So call out my name when I kiss you
So gently, oh, I want you to stay (I want you to stay)
I want you to stay even though you don't want me
Girl, why can't you wait? (Girl, why can't you wait 'til I?)
Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of loving?
Babe, call out my name (say call out my name, baby)
Girl, call out my name, and I'll be on my way
And I'll be on my

On my way, on my way
On my way, on my way, ooh
On my way, on my way, on my way
On my way, on my way, on my way
(On my)
---------------------------------------------------
I'm going back to 505
If it's a 7-hour flight or a 45-minute drive
In my imagination you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs

Stop and wait a sec
Oh when you look at me like that my darling
What did you expect?
I'd probably still adore you with your hands around my neck
Or I did last time I checked

Not shy of a spark
A knife twists at the thought that I should fall short of the mark
Frightened by the bite though it's no harsher than the bark
Middle of adventure, such a perfect place to start

I'm going back to 505
If it's a 7-hour flight or a 45-minute drive
In my imagination you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs

But I crumble completely when you cry
It seems like once again you've had to greet me with "Goodbye"
I'm always just about to go and spoil a surprise
Take my hands off of your eyes too soon

I'm going back to 505
If it's a 7-hour flight or a 45-minute drive
In my imagination you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs

...and a smile
---------------------------------------------------
Last night, all I think about is you
Don't stop, baby, you can walk through
Don't want, baby, think about you
You know that I'm never gonna lose

Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

Usually I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but

Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I'll say goodbye

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Heat waves been fakin' me out

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror
---------------------------------------------------
We were speeding together
Down the dark avenues
But besides all the stardom
All we got was blues
But through all the sorrow
We've been riding high
And the truth of the matter is
I never let you go, let you go

We were scanning the cities
Rocking to pay their dues
But besides all the glamor
All we got was bruised
But through all the sorrow
We've been riding high
And the truth of the matter is
I never let you go, let you go

You go down just like Holy Mary
Mary on a, Mary on a cross
Not just another bloody Mary
Mary on a, Mary on a cross
If you choose to run away with me
I will tickle you internally
And I see nothing wrong with that

We were searching for reasons
To play by the rules
But we quickly found out
It was just for fools
Now through all the sorrow
We'll be riding high
And the truth of the matter is
I never let you go, let you go

You go down just like Holy Mary
Mary on a, Mary on a cross
Not just another bloody Mary
Mary on a, Mary on a...

You go down just like Holy Mary
Mary on a, Mary on a cross
Your beauty never, ever scared me
Mary on a, Mary on a cross
If you choose to run away with me
I will tickle you internally
And I see nothing wrong with that

(Mary on a, Mary on a cross)
Nothing wrong with that
(Mary on a, Mary on a cross)
Nothing wrong with that
(Mary on a, Mary on a cross)
(Mary on a) Mary on a cross
---------------------------------------------------
Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift
The type that sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found that makes me think of you somehow and I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep
Spilling drinks on my settee

(Do I wanna know?)
If this feeling flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go)
Was sort of hoping that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know)
That the nights were mainly made for saying things that you can't say tomorrow day

Crawling back to you

Ever thought of calling when you've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
Now I've thought it through

Crawling back to you

So have you got the guts?
Been wondering if your heart's still open and if so I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down and pucker up
I'm sorry to interrupt. It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of trying to kiss you
I don't know if you feel the same as I do
But we could be together if you wanted to

(Do I wanna know?)
If this feeling flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go)
Was sort of hoping that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know)
That the nights were mainly made for saying things that you can't say tomorrow day

Crawling back to you (crawling back to you)

Ever thought of calling when you've had a few? (you've had a few)
'Cause I always do ('cause I always do)
Maybe I'm too (maybe I'm too busy) busy being yours to fall for somebody new
Now I've thought it through

Crawling back to you

(Do I wanna know?)
If this feeling flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go)
Was sort of hoping that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know)
That the nights were mainly made for saying things that you can't say tomorrow day

(Do I wanna know?)
Too busy being yours to fall
(Sad to see you go)
Ever thought of calling darling?
(Do I wanna know?)
Do you want me crawling back to you?
---------------------------------------------------
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

Your man on the road, he doin' promo
You said, "Keep our business on the low-low"
I'm just tryna get you out the friend zone
'Cause you look even better than the photos
I can't find your house, send me the info
Driving through the gated residential
Found out I was coming, sent your friends home
Keep on tryna hide it, but your friends know

I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

I'ma let you know and keep it simple
Tryna keep it up don't seem so simple
I just fucked two bitches 'fore I saw you
And you gon' have to do it at my tempo
Always tryna send me off to rehab
Drugs started feeling like it's decaf
I'm just tryna live life for the moment
And all these motherfuckers want a relapse

I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

Hills have eyes, the hills have eyes
Who are you to judge? Who are you to judge?
Hide your lies, girl, hide your lies (Hide your lies, oh, baby)
Only you to trust, only you

I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

What about love? What about love?
---------------------------------------------------
When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true

Give me a day or two
To think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do

Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passing through
Was I even on your way?

I knew when I asked you to
Be cool about what I was telling you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do
And I'd end up more afraid

Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly weren't aware that you
Made me miserable
So if you really wanna know

When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true

You call me again, drunk in your Benz
Driving home under the influence
You scared me to death but I'm wasting my breath
'Cause you only listen to your fucking friends

I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city

And I don't talk shit about you on the Internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fucking sad

So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad

I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends so I
Shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid

You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just fuckin' leave me alone, yeah (Fuck you)
Ah
Goddamn
Ah
Fuck you
Fuck you
---------------------------------------------------
You're just like my favourite song going 'round and 'round my head
Like my favourite song going 'round and 'round my head

Five days on the freeway
Riding shotgun with you (Yeah, yeah)
Two hearts in the fast lane
We had big dreams in blue (Yeah, yeah)

Playing "Sweet Child O' Mine"
And I still feel that line
Where are you now?
Where are you now?

Hey, it's been too long
Too long ago, my love
Where did we go wrong?
Too late to turn around
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Hey, it's been too long

You're just like my favourite song going 'round and 'round my head
Like my favourite song going 'round and 'round my head

You're just like my favourite song going 'round and 'round my head
Like my favourite song going 'round and 'round my head

(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey)
Where are you now?
(Hey, hey, hey)
Hey, it's been too long

Some days I can feel it
But the feeling ain't all blue (Yeah, yeah)
You got me believing
One day you gotta come through (Yeah, yeah)
Lost in these city lights
'Cause I can't sleep tonight
Where are you now?
Where are you now?

Hey, it's been too long
Too long ago, my love
Where did we go wrong?
Too late to turn around
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Hey, it's been too long

You're just like my favourite song going 'round and 'round my head
Like my favorite song going 'round and 'round my head

You're just like my favourite song going 'round and 'round my head
Like my favourite song going 'round and 'round my head

(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey)
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?

Where are you now?
---------------------------------------------------
I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around

And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?

And I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever now I drive alone past your street

And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do
Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you

And I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one
Oh, and I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever now I drive alone past your street

Red lights
Stop signs
I still see your face
In the white cars
Front yards
Can't drive past the places
We used to
Go to
'Cause I still fucking love you, babe

Sidewalks
We crossed
I still hear your voice
In the traffic
We're laughing
Over all the noise
God, I'm so blue
Know we're through
But I still fucking love you, babe

I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever now I drive alone past your street
Yeah, you said forever now I drive alone past your street
---------------------------------------------------
First things first
I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh ooh
The way that things have been, oh ooh

Second things second
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh ooh
The master of my sea, oh ooh

I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Third things third
Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh ooh
Your spirit up above, oh ooh

I was choking in the crowd
Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
Till it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...

Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Last things last
By the grace of the fire and the flames
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh ooh
The blood in my veins, oh ooh
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
Till it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...

Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
---------------------------------------------------
(One, two, three, four)
Ooh, ooh

Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you

Every pure intention ends when the good times start
Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
It started under neon lights and then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

We took the long way 'round
And burned 'til the fun ran out, now

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
---------------------------------------------------
Yo siempre la llevo al cielo
Conmigo quema ella a cada rato
Se crece y coge vuelo porque yo no la celo
Y cuando estamos en el cuarto
No tengo que decirle, solita rompe el hielo
Sabe donde poner sus manos
Yo con mi punto debil, por eso no la dejo
Desde hace tiempo frente al espejo, yo

Le doy lo que le hace falta
Dice que la obligo a hacer lo que no debe
Entre paredes nadie sabe lo que pasa
Despues del primer beso nada la detiene
Soy la razon por la que ella pierde la calma
No se conforma, una noche no es suficiente
Al despedirnos, no deja que yo me vaya
Dice que conmigo se siente diferente
Me dana la mente que lo diga asi

La que no chiche, quedate en tu casa
Bebe y se pone cuatro letras como NASA
Chingando sin condones, las Plan B nunca fracasan
Me lo mama a dos manos y hasta lo abraza

Ella es una hija 'e puta como Tokio
Despues que se lo meto la mando pa' donde el novio
Y le preguntan que si chingo rico y dice "Obvio"
Un polvo no es un polvo si no jode el matrimonio

Y le gusta chingar arrebata'
Perreando sucio, tu eres senda bellaca
Nengo lo dijo, que chocha con bicho y bicho con nalga
Y si eres chumba, pues mueve la espalda

Mami, yo no disimulo
Que Dios bendiga ese culo (Ay, papi)
Te lambo toa y te enchulo
Se va a venir y grita (¡Bien duro!)

Yo siempre la llevo al cielo
Conmigo quema ella a cada rato
Se crece y coge vuelo porque yo no la celo
Y cuando estamos en el cuarto
No tengo que decirle, solita rompe el hielo
Sabe donde poner sus manos
Yo con mi punto debil, por eso no la dejo
Desde hace tiempo frente al espejo, yo

Le doy lo que le hace falta
Dice que la obligo a hacer lo que no debe
Entre paredes nadie sabe lo que pasa
Despues del primer beso nada la detiene
Soy la razon por la que ella pierde la calma
No se conforma, una noche no es suficiente
Al despedirnos, no deja que yo me vaya
Dice que conmigo se siente diferente
Me dana la mente que lo diga asi

Solo tu y yo
Viajando por las nubes, ya el cielo se callo
Dame tu cuerpecito, ya la bomba estallo
Tu sabes que yo estoy pa' ti
Te vo' a hacer cosas diferentes y no te olvidaras de mi

Contigo a las alturas, mami, elevame
Si sabes lo que haces, pue' enamorame
Yo se que ya tu cuerpo esta pidiendo sexo
Fuego y beso'

Lo de lo tuyo y mio es un desafio
A veces maquino solo y cuando me acuerdo me rio
Las veces que a tu casa le he llegao amanecio
Y he brincao los portones por el monte y en tu cama te he partio
Toma, que este blunt esta encendio
Mami, ponte ready, hijueputa como yo no te ha comio
El perfume que regaste por tu cuello
Me enredo con tu cabello
Y tengo ganas de lamberte como un sello

Cua-cuando la tengo me dice "Jalame el pelo"
Grita "Que rico, me gusta como mil veces"
Nos devoramos sin decir "Amor, te quiero"
Pero sabemos que las ganas crecen y crecen

Cuando la tengo me dice "Jalame el pelo"
Grita "Que rico, me gusta como mil veces"
Nos devoramos sin decir "Amor, te quiero"
Pero sabemos que las ganas crecen y crecen

Yo siempre la llevo al cielo
Conmigo ella quema a cada rato
Se crece y coge vuelo porque yo no la celo
Y cuando estamos en el cuarto
No tengo que decirle, solita rompe el hielo
Sabe donde poner sus manos
Yo con mi punto debil, por eso no la dejo
Desde hace tiempo frente al espejo, yo

Le doy lo que le hace falta

He don't love
Me no more
He don't love
He don't love
Me no more

Evergreen, he controls me
Was there something wrong with my body?
Am I not what you wanted, babe?
If I ever tried, if I ever tried
I would

Evergreen, he tears me to pieces
(Evergreen) Doesn't even have to try

She don't
Know you like me
She could never love you more
More than me
But sometimes I pray that you fall in love
I've cried, I've cried so much
For you, baby

Evergreen, he tears me to pieces
(Evergreen) Doesn't even have to try
(Evergreen)

You know you really made me hate myself
Had to stop before I break myself
Shoulda broke it off to date myself
You didn't deserve me at all
At all, at all

One last time
I see, (Ever) Evergreen
Please don't come home to me
Sweet Evergreen
He don't love
Me no more

He don't love
Me no more
He don't love
He don't love
Me no more

First things first rest in peace Uncle Phil
For real, you the only father that I ever knew
I get my bitch pregnant I'mma be a better you
Prophecies that I made way back in the Ville
Fulfilled. Listen: even back when we was broke my team ill
Martin Luther King would have been on Dreamville
Talk to a nigga

One time for my LA sisters
One time for my LA hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who knows

Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved

No role models and I'm here right now
No role models to speak of
Searchin' through my memory, my memory
I couldn't find one
Last night I was gettin' my feet rubbed
By the baddest bitch, not Trina, but I swear to God
This bitch will make you call your girl up and tell her "Hey, what's good?"
"Sorry I'm never comin' home I'mma stay for good"
Then hang the phone up, and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame 'bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said "Nah, I was the same without it"
But then I thought back, back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
Before I started callin' bitches "bitches" so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody
You wasn't sweatin' me

One time for my LA sisters
One time for my LA hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who knows

Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved

I want a real love, dark-skinned and Aunt Viv love
That Jada and that Will love
That leave a toothbrush at your crib love
And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love
Nigga I don't want no bitch from reality shows
Out-of-touch-with-reality hoes
Out in Hollywood bringin' back 5 or 6 hoes
Fuck 'em then we kick 'em to the door
Nigga you know how it go
She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap
You think if I didn't rap she would flirt back
Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt before she leave
"I'mma need my shirt back"
Nigga you know how it go

One time for my LA sisters
One time for my LA hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who knows

Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved

There's an old saying in Tennessee - I know it's in Texas - probably in Tennessee that says fool me once, shame on - shame on you.
If you fool me we can't get fooled again

Fool me one time shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace signs
Load the chopper, let it rain on you
(Bop, bop, bop)

Fool me one time shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace signs
Load the chopper, let it rain on you
(Bop, bop, bop)

My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet
My only regret was too young for Nia Long
Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows
Hand her a script the bitch probably couldn't read along
My only regret was too young for Sade Adu
My only regret could never take Aaliyah home
Now all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone
With the stale face 'cause they know it's they song
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)

Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved

Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
---------------------------------------------------
You and me, we made a vow
For better or for worse
I can't believe you let me down
But the proof's in the way it hurts

For months on end I've had my doubts
Denying every tear
I wish this would be over now
But I know that I still need you here

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

You've been so unavailable
Now sadly I know why
Your heart is unobtainable
Even though Lord knows you kept mine

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

I have loved you for many years
Maybe I am just not enough
You've made me realize my deepest fear
By lying and tearing us up

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

I know I'm not the only one
I know I'm not the only one
And I know
And I know
And I know
And I know
And I know
And I don't know
I know I'm not the only one

Pensaba que te habia olvidado
Pero pusieron la cancion
Que cantamos bien borrachos
Que bailamos bien borrachos
Nos besamos bien borrachos los dos

Pensaba que te habia olvidado
Pero pusieron la cancion
Que cantamos bien borrachos
Que bailamos bien borrachos
Nos besamos bien borrachos los dos

Pensaba que te habia olvidado

Justo cuando creia que por comerme a dos o diez
Te olvidaria, cogi un respiro y me sali de la via
Y como un pendejo no sabia lo que hacia
Nunca lo supere, nunca te supere
Hasta me aprendi to'as las baladas en Ingles
Respire y conte hasta tres eres la fantasia oscura de Kanye West

Bebe hey
Hace tiempo lo barato me salio caro
Ya solo Twiteo o a la loca disparo
¿Como olvidar lo bella que era en el carro?
La que aqui yo solo

Pensaba que te habia olvidado
Pero pusieron la cancion
Que cantamos bien borrachos
Que bailamos bien borrachos
Nos besamos bien borrachos los dos

Pensaba que te habia olvidado
Pero pusieron la cancion
Que cantamos bien borrachos
Que bailamos bien borrachos
Nos besamos bien borrachos los dos

Y hace tiempo
Que no venias a mi cabeza
Pero ya van par de cervezas
Y me acorde de como tu me besas
De todos los polvos encima de la mesa
En el carro, en la playa y el motel
En casa de tu pa' y cuando yo te iba a ver
Las veces que tu Mai nos llego a coger
Tu brincando moja'ita sudando Chanel
Yo se que lo nuestro es cosa de ayer
Y me pone contento que te va bien con el
Yo ni te extranaba ni te queria ver
Pero pusieron la cancion que te gustaba poner
Y me acorde ti, cuando me hiciste feliz
Se acabo pues me fui, yo mismo me rio de mi, porque

Pensaba que te habia olvidado
Pero pusieron la cancion
Que cantamos bien borrachos
Que bailamos bien borrachos
Nos besamos bien borrachos los dos

Y yo pensaba que tu nombre estaba muerto
Pero te sone despierto
Ey, hoy sali pa' la calle suelto
Sin sentimiento el corazon desierto

Y yo pensaba que tu nombre estaba muerto
Pero te sone despierto
Hoy sali pa' la calle suelto
Sin sentimiento el corazon desierto
---------------------------------------------------
Yeah, yo

Estoy buscando alguien que me quiera como Pucca quiere a Garu
Una baby otaku
Que me gima como un anime y lo mame en el Subaru (-Baru)
Bebecita, dime awu (Awu)
Un cosplay, bebecita de Chun-Li
Un bofeton, a tu pompa, Will Smith
Montate en la nave, tunning de Need For Speed, y
Es como Icata, esta rompiendo en el IG
Se puso roja cuando conmigo choco
Le meti, y la almohada mordio
Lo movio de arriba a abajo Geri Hoops
Lo que tocaste, carino, no era la Glock

Ella su pompa postea
Como twerkea, pa' que yo la vea (Vea)
Yo le llego donde sea
Le caigo a tu aldea, solo pa' que vea (Vea, el Nicko pero el OG)

Y OG Kush, sube, baja, modo hentai pero todo shh
No-No-Nos fugamo' en la Mitsubishi, nos tiramo' una (Shh)
Ando con el Poli, no con la policia
El Chino era sapo y ni Alex lo sabia
Dandome la vida de GTA que queria
Portando og de Khalifa y no te hablo de Mia (Calla'o)
Me gusta como me mira esa muneca
Cuando me baila, cuando me besa
El cora lo tengo como rompecabeza'
Y tu culito e' la ultima pieza

Estoy buscando alguien que me quiera como Pucca quiere a Garu (Garu)

Sin ropa en mi cama como Chun-Li lo mama, mientra' estoy jugando
Nintendo, no con tus sentimiento'

Obie Trice
Real name no gimmicks


Two trailer-park girls go 'round the outside, 'round the outside, 'round the outside
Two trailer-park girls go 'round the outside, 'round the outside, 'round the outside

Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back
Guess who's back
Guess who's back
Guess who's back
Guess who's back
Guess who's back
Guess who's back

I've created a monster
'Cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more
They want Shady I'm chopped liver
Well if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump-start my heart
Quicker than a shock
When I get shocked at the hospital by the doctor
When I'm not cooperating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (hey!)

You waited this long now stop debating
'Cause I'm back I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating

So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me so let me see
They try to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me

So come on dip, bum on your lips fuck that
Cum on your lips and some on your tits and get ready 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits
Fuck you, Debbie!

Now this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

I said this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Little hellions kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners, helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells "bitch"

A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution
Polluting the air waves a rebel
So just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass
And it's a disaster
Such a catastrophe for you to see so damn much of my ass
You ask for me?

Well I'm back
Fix your bent antennae
Tune it in and then I'm gonna enter in
And up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention back for the winter

I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing attention please
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my 10 cents my 2 cents is free
A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me?

Now this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

I said this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

A tisk-it a task-it
I'll go tit for tat with anybody who's talking this shit, that shit
Chris Kirkpatrick you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards

And Moby
You can get stomped by Obie
You 36 year old bald-headed fag blow me
You don't know me
You're too old
Let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno

Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol

But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me I'm just obscene

No, I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey)

There's a concept that works
20 million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me

Now this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

I said this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Kids

I'm findin' ways to articulate the feelin' I'm goin' through
I just can't say I don't love you (Yeah)
'Cause I love you, yeah
It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold
But tonight, I'm gon' let you know
Let me tell the truth
Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah

You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes
You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry
You're scared to be lonely, 'specially in the night
I'm scared that I'll miss you, happens every time
I don't want this feelin', I can't afford love
I try to find a reason to pull us apart
It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect
And I know that you're worth it
I can't walk away, oh

Even though we're goin' through it
And it makes you feel alone
Just know that I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah
The distance and the time between us
It'll never change my mind 'cause
Baby, I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah (Say)

I'm findin' ways to manipulate the feelin' you're goin' through
But, baby girl, I'm not blamin' you
Just don't blame me, too, yeah
'Cause I can't take this pain forever
And you won't find no one that's better
'Cause I'm right for you, babe
I think I'm right for you, babe

You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes
You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry
It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect
And I know that you're worth it
I can't walk away, oh

Even though we're goin' through it
And it makes you feel alone
Just know that I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah
The distance and the time between us
It'll never change my mind 'cause
Baby, I would die for you, uh
Baby, I would die for you, yeah

I would die for you, I would lie for you
Keep it real with you, I would kill for you, my baby
I'm just sayin', yeah
I would die for you, I would lie for you
Keep it real with you, I would kill for you, my baby
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na

Even though we're goin' through it
And it makes you feel alone
Just know that I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah
The distance and the time between us
It'll never change my mind 'cause
Baby, I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah (Oh, babe)

(Die for you)
---------------------------------------------------
Youngblood thinks there's always tomorrow
I miss your touch some nights when I'm hollow
I know you crossed a bridge that I can't follow
Since the love that you left is all that I get, I want you to know

That if I can't be close to you, I'll settle for the ghost of you
I miss you more than life (More than life)
And if you can't be next to me, your memory is ecstasy
I miss you more than life, I miss you more than life

Youngblood thinks there's always tomorrow
I need more time, but time can't be borrowed
I'd leave it all behind if I could follow
Since the love that you left is all that I get, I want you to know

That if I can't be close to you, I'll settle for the ghost of you
I miss you more than life (Yeah)
And if you can't be next to me, your memory is ecstasy (Oh)
I miss you more than life, I miss you more than life

Woah-oh-oh-oh
Na-na-na
More than life (Oh)

So if I can't get close to you, I'll settle for the ghost of you
I miss you more than life
And if you can't be next to me, your memory is ecstasy
I miss you more than life, I miss you more than life

Put some babies in your life and take away the drama
Put the paper in a picture like a diorama
Gotta face a lot of people of the opposite
'Cause the world told me, "We ain't got the common sense"
Gotta prove it to myself that I'm on top of shit
And you would never know a god without the goddesses
Honest as fuckin' honest get
And I could be on everything
I mean I could be the leader, head of all the states
I could smile and jiggle it 'til his pockets empty
I could be the CEO, just look at Robyn Fenty
And I'ma be there for you 'cause you on my team, girl
Don't ever think you ain't hella these niggas dream girl
They wanna pit us against each other
When we succeedin' for no reasons
They wanna see us end up like we Regina on Mean Girls
Princess or queen, tomboy or king (Yeah)
You've heard a lot, you've never seen (Nah)
Mother Earth, Mother Mary rise to the top
Divine feminine, I'm feminine (Why?)

---------------------------------------------------
Brown guilty eyes and little white lies
Yeah, I played dumb but I always knew
That you talked to her, maybe did even worse
I kept quiet so I could keep you

And ain't it funny
How you ran to her
The second that we called it quits?

And ain't it funny
How you said you were friends?
Now it sure as hell don't look like it

You betrayed me
And I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah

You talked to her
When we were together
Loved you at your worst
But that didn't matter

It took you two weeks
To go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat
But you're still a traitor

Now you bring her around
Just to shut me down
Show her off like she's a new trophy

And I know if you were true
There's no damn way that you
Could fall in love with somebody that quickly

Ain't it funny
All the twisted games
All the questions you used to avoid?

Ain't it funny?
Remember I brought her up
And you told me I was paranoid

You betrayed me
And I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah

You talked to her
When we were together
Loved you at your worst
But that didn't matter

It took you two weeks
To go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat
But you're still a traitor

God, I wish that you had thought this through
Before I went and fell in love with you
When she's sleeping in the bed we made
Don't you dare forget about the way

You betrayed me
'Cause I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah

You talked to her
When we were together
You gave me your word
But that didn't matter

It took you two weeks
To go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat
But you're still

You're still a traitor
Yeah, you're still a traitor

God, I wish that you had thought this through
Before I went and fell in love with you
---------------------------------------------------
Don't blame me
Love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right
Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life

I've been breaking hearts a long time
And toying with them older guys
Just playthings for me to use
Something happened for the first time
In the darkest little paradise
Shaking, pacing, I just need you

For you
I would cross the line
I would waste my time
I would lose my mind
They say, "She's gone too far this time."

Don't blame me
Love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right
Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life

Don't blame me
Love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right
Oh, Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life

My name is whatever you decide
And I'm just gonna call you mine
I'm insane, but I'm your baby (your baby)
Echoes (echoes) of your name inside my mind
Halo, hiding my obsession
I once was poison ivy, but now I'm your daisy

And, baby, for you
I would fall from grace
Just to touch your face
If you walk away
I'd beg you on my knees to stay

Don't blame me
Love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right
Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life

Don't blame me
Love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right
Oh, Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life

I get so high, oh
Every time you'reevery time you're loving me
You're loving me
Trip of my life, oh
Every time you'reevery time you're touching me
You're touching me

Every time you'reevery time you're loving me

Oh, Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life
(Using for the rest of my life. Oh!)

Don't blame me
Love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right (doing it right, no)
Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life

Don't blame me
Love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right (you ain't doing it...)
Oh, Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life (I'll be using, I'll be using)

I get so high, oh
Every time you'reevery time you're loving me
You're loving me
Oh, Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life
---------------------------------------------------
The mirror's image
Tells me it's home time
But I'm not finished
'Cause you're not by my side
And as I arrived I thought I saw you leaving
Carrying your shoes
Decided that once again I was just dreaming
Of bumping into you

Now it's three in the morning and I'm trying to change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls and to my message you reply
"Why'd you only call me when you're high?
Hi, why'd you only call me when you're high?"

Somewhere darker
Talking the same shite
I need a partner (hey)
Well, are you out tonight?
It's harder and harder to get you to listen
More I get through the gears
Incapable of making alright decisions
And having bad ideas

Now it's three in the morning and I'm trying to change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls and to my message you reply (message you reply)
"Why'd you only call me when you're high? (why'd you only call me when you're high?)
Hi, why'd you only call me when you're high?"

And I can't see you here wonder where I might?
Sort of feels like I'm running out of time
I haven't found what I was hoping to find
You said, "You gotta be up in the morning, gonna have an early night
And you're starting to bore me, baby
Why'd you only call me when you're high?"

Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
---------------------------------------------------
Going out tonight
Changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Everything she never had she's showing off


Driving too fast
Moon is breaking through her hair
She's heading for something that she won't forget
Having no regrets is all that she really wants


We're only getting older, baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change me and you


Chasing it tonight,
Doubts are running 'round her head
He's waiting, hides behind a cigarette
Heart is beating loud, and she doesn't want it to stop


Moving too fast
Moon is lighting up her skin
She's falling, doesn't even know it yet
Having no regrets is all that she really wants


We're only getting older, baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change me and you


Going out tonight
Changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Reminds her of the missing piece of innocence she lost


We're only getting older, baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change, baby
It will never change, baby
It will never change me and you

Well good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world

And good for you, I guess that you've been working on yourself
I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better man for your brand-new girl

Well good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doing great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that

I've lost my mind
I've spent the night
Crying on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

Well good for you, I guess you're getting everything you want
You bought a new car and your career's really taking off
It's like we never even happened, baby
What the fuck is up with that?

And good for you, it's like you never even met me
Remember when you swore to God, I was the only
Person who ever got you
Well, screw that and screw you
You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do

Well good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doing great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that

I've lost my mind
I've spent the night
Crying on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

Maybe I'm too emotional
But your apathy's like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all
Maybe I'm too emotional
Your apathy's like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all

Well good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doing great out there without me, baby
Like a damn sociopath

I've lost my mind
I've spent the night
Crying on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

Well good for you, I guess you moved on really easily

1, 2, 3, 4
Need a boy who can cuddle with me all night
Keep me warm, love me long, be my sunlight
Tell me lies, we can argue, we can fight
Yeah we did it before but we'll do it tonight
That afro' black boy with the gold teeth
He dark skin looking at me like he know me
I wonder if he got the G or the B
Let me find out and see, he coming over to me, yeah

These days I'm way too lonely
I'm missing out, I know
These days I'm way too alone
And I'm known for giving love away but

I want
Someone to love me
I need
Someone who needs me
'Cause it don't feel right when it's late at night
And it's just me in my dreams
So I want
Someone to love
That's what I fucking want

Look
You know it's harder to find in these times
But I got nothin' but love on my mind
I need a baby while I'm in my prime
Need an adversary to my down and weary
Like tell me there's life when I'm stressing at night
Be like, "You'll be okay" and "Everything is alright", uh
Love me or nothing 'cause I'm not wanting anything
But your loving, your body, and a little bit of ya brain

These days I'm way too lonely
I'm missing out, I know
These days I'm way too alone
And I'm known for giving love away but

I want
Someone to love me
I need
Someone who needs me
'Cause it don't feel right when it's late at night
And it's just me in my dreams
So I want
Someone to love
That's what I fucking want

I want
Someone to love me
I need
Someone who needs me
'Cause it don't feel right when it's late at night
And it's just me in my dreams
So I want
Someone to love
That's what I fucking want

Antes que este Phillie se apague, yo te voy olvidar-dar
Yo te voy a olvidar-dar
Antes que este Phillie se apague, yo te voy olvidar-dar-dar
Yo te voy a olvidar, yal

Me paso fumando bajo las palmera'
A ver si me cae un coco en la cabeza y me borra mi vida entera
Veo parejitas dandose beso' y me da dentera
Vo'a tirarle el radio por mar si sale sin bandera porque
No puedo escuchar cancione' de romance (Du)
Me canse a de que pensar en ti no me canse
El ultimo petalo me dijo que aun hay chance
No se si es verdad, pero si va' a volver, avance
Por favor, aunque sea un mes ante', que salga el sol
Que en la manana coja alergia buscando tu olor
Treinta trofeo' y aun me siento perdedor, perdedor
Buscame el encendedor, ey
Que si no te olvido me vo'a mudar pa' Chile
Pa' Argentina o pa' El Salvador
"Pero denme el lighter" dije, por favor, por favor

Y ante' que este Phillie se apague, yo te voy olvidar-dar
Ey, yo te voy a olvidar-dar
Ante' que este Phillie se apague, yo te voy olvidar-dar (Ey)
Yo te voy a olvidar, yal

Ey, ey, ey
Me estoy ahogando y a la' ola' le' pedi socorro
Escribo tu nombre en la arena a ver si asi lo borro
Pero tus labio' y tus ojo' los tengo de gorro
No sales de mi cabeza (Du)
Otro Phillie y otra cerveza
Ya tu recuerdo me pesa
Te difrazaste de Rubi, y eras Teresa
Pero soy un pendejo y todavia me interesa'
Ey, ey, saber de tu paradero
Y preguntarte si fui verdadero
O si esta' vola' como avion y yo fui pasajero (Wuh)
Que cojones, todavia yo te quiero
Jeh, jeh, los muchacho' dicen que yo estoy charriando
Jeh, jeh, ey, pero en bajita seguimos quemando (Rra)

Y ante' que este Phillie se apague, yo te voy olvidar-dar (Eh)
Yo te voy a olvidar-dar
Ante' que este Phillie se apague, yo te voy olvidar-dar
Yo te voy a olvidar, yal
Y ante' que este Phillie se apague, yo te voy olvidar-dar
Ey, yo te voy a olvidar-dar
Y ante' que este Phillie se apague, yo te voy olvidar-dar
Ey, yo te voy a olvidar, yal

I tell myself you don't mean a thing
And what we got, got no hold on me
But when you're not there I just crumble
I tell myself I don't care that much
But I feel like I die 'til I feel your touch

Only love, only love can hurt like this
Only love can hurt like this
Must've been a deadly kiss
Only love can hurt like this

Say I wouldn't care if you walked away (Oh)
But every time you're there I'm begging you to stay
And when you come close (When you come close), I just tremble
And every time, every time you go (Oh)
It's like a knife that cuts right to my soul

Only love, only love can hurt like this
Only love can hurt like this
Must've been a deadly kiss
Only love can hurt like this
Only love can hurt like this

Your kisses burn into my skin
Only love can hurt like this
But it's the sweetest pain
Burning hot through my veins
Love is torture makes me more sure
Only love can hurt like this

Only love can hurt like this
Only love can hurt like this
Must've been a deadly kiss
Only love can hurt like this

Only love can hurt like this
Your kisses burn into my skin
Only love can hurt like this
Only love can hurt like this
Only love can hurt like this
Only love can hurt
Save me, save me
Only love, only love
'Cause only love can hurt like this
And it must've been a deadly kiss
---------------------------------------------------
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)


I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you


Can't you see that you're smothering me
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control?
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart right in front of you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take


I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

And I know
I may end up failing too
But I know
You were just like me with someone disappointed in you

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you


I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
(I'm tired of being what you want me to be)
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
(I'm tired of being what you want me to be)
---------------------------------------------------
Don't remind me
I'm mindin' my own damn business
Don't try to find me
I'm better left alone than in this
It doesn't surprise me
Do you really think that I could care?
If you really don't like me
Find somebody else, it could be anyone else out there

Don't fret
I don't ever wanna see you
And I never wanna meet you again
One thing
When you're angry, you're a jerk
And then you treat me like I'm worth nothin'
Don't fret
I don't ever wanna see you
And I never wanna meet you again
It'll happen again
I watch it happen over and over again
Don't fret
I don't ever wanna see you
And I never wanna meet you again
One thing
When you're angry, you're a jerk
And then you treat me like I'm worth nothin'

Don't remind me
I'm mindin' my own damn business
Don't try to find me
I'm better left alone than in this
It doesn't surprise me
Do you really think that I could care?
If you really don't like me
Find somebody else, it could be anyone else out there

Don't fret

Don't fret
I don't ever wanna see you
And I never wanna meet you again
One thing
When you're angry, you're a jerk

You said you hated the ocean, but you're surfin' now
I said I'd love you for life, but I just sold our house
We were kids at the start, I guess we're grown-ups now (Mmm)
Couldn't ever imagine even havin' doubts
But not everything works out, no

Now I'm out dancin' with strangers
You could be casually datin'
Damn, it's all changin' so fast

Asi es la vida, si
Yeah, that's just life, baby
Yeah, love came around
And it knocked me down
But I'm back on my feet
Asi es la vida, si
Yeah, that's just life, baby
I was barely standin'
But now I'm dancin'
He's all over me

Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam

Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam (Eh, eh, uh-huh)
Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam (Uh-huh)
Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam

It's been a hell of a year, thank God we made it out
Yeah we were riding a wave, and trying not to drown
And on the surface I held it together
But underneath, I sorta came unwound
Where would I be? You're all that I need
My world, baby, you hold me down
You always hold me down, now

I've been the breaker and broken
Every mistake turned to moments
Wouldn't take anything back

Asi es la vida, si (Asi es)
Yeah, that's just life, baby
Yeah, love came around
And it knocked me down
But I'm back on my feet
Asi es la vida, si
Yeah, that's just life, baby
I was barely standin'
But now I'm dancin'
She's all over me (He's all over me)

I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy

I need somebody to heal
Somebody to know
Somebody to have
Somebody to hold
It's easy to say
But it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

Now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you

Now, I need somebody to know
Somebody to heal
Somebody to have
Just to know how it feels
It's easy to say
But it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape

Now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound til I come back around

For now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

But now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
(I'll never let you down, baby)
(It's really Yung Gravy)
Uh, aye

With your baby mama at the crib and blow her back out
Shawty Filipino and she call me Manny Pacquiao
Alley Oop without the hoop, they call me Jerry Stackhouse
Gazin' out in public, but your mama made me snap out
Before I get the dough, I got the morning routine
Wake up bright and early, this some brand new cream
Floss three times, baby, I'm so clean
Gravy got cheese, now that's poutine (Whoa, baby)

Gravy come in hot like I'm hoppin' off the griddle
Pull up on the kid if you're tryna get belittled
All the mamas love me, now I think I'm peanut brittle
Flex the rainbow, bangin' like some Skittles

Gravy, why you out of pocket? (Out of pocket)
Stop it (No, no)
I'm gettin' money, Gravy Crocker
Drop it

Never take a L no more
Never take a damn thing slow
All I know is chase this dough and get money (Get the money, get the money)
Never gonna take no loss
Never gonna lose my sauce
All I know is chase this (Whoa), and get money (Gettin' money, gettin' money, gettin' money)

Get money
Probably into the early morning
Or get money
Yeah, I live the fast life (Whoa)

Yeah, you know I life the fast live
I don't got a type, baby, I'm a cash type
Still gettin' dividends from a past life
I'll get your daddy's net worth on a bad night
'Cause I act right
Yeah, I'm rockin' Rick, clappin' ass-tleys like the '80s
Never give it up until the reaper come and slay me
Pull up with a Zelda and a Peach and a Daisy
I be dirty dancin', now they yellin', "Gravy Swayze"

Damn, Gravy, you so vicious (Ooh)
You so clean, so delicious (So delicious)
How come you ain't got no misses?
Count that paper, count the riches

May I have your attention please?
May I have your attention please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here

Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam and Tommy just burst in the door
And started whooping her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwing her over furniture (Ah!)
It's the return of the... "Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"
And Dr. Dre said... nothing, you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement! (Ha-ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem

"Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walking around grabbing his you-know-what
Flipping the you-know-who." "Yeah, but he's so cute though!"
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse, than what's going on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes, I wanna get on TV and just let loose, but can't
But it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
"My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips"
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course they gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
"We ain't nothing but mammals.." Well, some of us cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope

But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
"But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?"
Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can, sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Yo Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch, put me on blast on MTV
"Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee!"
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me
So I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me; who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me
It just might be the next best thing but not quite me!

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

I'm like a head trip to listen to, cause I'm only giving you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your living room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it
In front of y'all and I don't gotta be false or sugarcoated at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it
I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums
It's funny; 'cause at the rate I'm going when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurses asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spitting on your onion rings

Or in the parking lot, circling
Screaming "I don't give a fuck!"
With his windows down and his system up
So, will the real Shady please stand up?
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Ha ha
Guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us
Fuck it, let's all stand up
---------------------------------------------------
Take you like a drug
I taste you on my tongue

You ask me what I'm thinking about
I tell you that I'm thinking about
Whatever you're thinking about (Ah)
Tell me something that I'll forget
And you might have to tell me again
It's crazy what you'll do for a friend

Go ahead and cry, little girl
Nobody does it like you do
I know how much it matters to you
I know that you got daddy issues
And if you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I know that you got daddy issues, and I do too

I tried to write your name in the rain
But the rain never came
So I made with the sun
The shade
Always comes at the worst time (Ah)

You ask me what I'm thinking about
I tell you that I'm thinking about
Whatever you're thinking about
Tell me something that I'll forget
And you might have to tell me again
It's crazy what you'll do for a friend

Go ahead and cry, little girl
Nobody does it like you do
I know how much it matters to you
I know that you got daddy issues
And if you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I know that you got daddy issues

I keep on trying to let you go
I'm dying to let you know
How I'm getting on
I didn't cry when you left at first
But now that you're dead it hurts
This time I gotta know
Where did my daddy go?
I'm not entirely here
Half of me has disappeared

Go ahead and cry, little boy
You know that your daddy did too
You know what your mama went through
You gotta let it out soon, just let it out

Go ahead and cry, little girl
Nobody does it like you do
I know how much it matters to you
I know that you got daddy issues
And if you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I know that you got daddy issues, and I do too

If you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I know that you got daddy issues, and I do too

No estaba esperando nada
De encontrarme contigo anoche
Solo era una mas
Una noche linda, algo especial

Pero algo esta tan diferente
Todo alrededor me gira de repente
Tu y yo, cambio el singular
Sin miedo, papito, ven y dame mas

Ven sin miedo
Sin barullo
No te cierres a este mundo
Fluye ahora
Ven conmigo
No intentes definirlo

Y ven aca
Amor, ven aca
Ven aca y dejame entrar
Ven aca
Amor, ven aca
Ven aca y dejame entrar

Lo siento, bebe (Eh, eh, eh)
No trates de enamorarme o no te hago coro (Eh, eh, eh)
Hace tiempo que de nadie yo no me enamoro (No me enamoro)
Y estoy puesto pa' usted
Pa' hacerlo otra vez, pero mi tiempo es oro
Yo por nadie me ajoro

Lo siento, bebe (Eh, eh, eh)
No trates de enamorarme o no te hago coro (Eh, eh, eh)
Hace tiempo que de nadie yo no me enamoro (Yo no me enamoro)
Y estoy puesto pa' usted
Pa' hacerlo otra vez, pero mi tiempo es oro
Yo por nadie me ajoro, eh

Te digo que ni lo intentes, eh
La vida es una y yo solo vivo el presente
Me gusta cuando estas caliente
Ahora me quieres pa' ti, mami, tu eres exigente, y
Bellaqueando, excelente
Pero se pone romantica de repente, y
Del amor no soy creyente
Cupido es un huelebicho, ese cabron siempre me miente

Y me hace pensar
En cosas que no van a pasar
Ya se como termina, ni lo vo' a comenzar
Que pase lo que pase, yo no lo vo' a forzar
Dime si te va' a quedar

Haciendolo, tocandono'
Pa' esto si, pero pa' aquello no
Haciendolo, tocandono'
Pa' chingar si, pero pa' serio no
Pa' eso no

Lo siento, bebe (Eh, eh, eh)
No trates de enamorarme o no te hago coro (Eh, eh, eh)
Hace tiempo que de nadie yo no me enamoro (No me enamoro)
Y estoy puesto pa' usted
Pa' hacerlo otra vez, pero mi tiempo es oro
Yo por nadie me ajoro

Lo siento, bebe
---------------------------------------------------
I found a love for me
Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me

'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes you're holding mine

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess
I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it,
Darling, you look perfect tonight

Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

We are still kids but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favourite song
When I saw you in that dress
Looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this
Darling, you look perfect tonight

No, no, no

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favourite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight
---------------------------------------------------
Yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh
Yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh
Ey

Quizas yo vuelva con mi ex
Y no te vuelva a ver
Quizas no te importa
Quizas te va a doler

Esto es un ratito, uh-oh
Mami, no te acostumbres
Que el amor es muy bonito
Pero siempre hay algo que lo interrumpe
Esto es un ratito, uh-oh
Mami, no te acostumbres
Que el amor es muy bonito
Pero siempre hay algo que lo interrumpe

Pa' mi que yo naci pa' estar solo
No hay una loca pa' este loco
El tiempo se va y queda poco
Baby, vamo' a hacerlo otra ve'
Chingar otra ve'

Porque manana quiza no vo' a estar
La luz se puso roja, hay que parar
O si quieres, nos bajamos y podemos perrear
Baby, esto no fue normal

Con cualquiera no me acuesto
A cualquiera no le meto
Ni le cuento mis secretos
Me pongo feliz cuando llegan tus texto'
Porque

Con cualquiera no me acuesto
A cualquiera no le meto
Ni le cuento mis secretos
Me pongo feliz cuando llegan tus texto'
O cuando en cuatro te lo meto

Ey, y te mojas toa
Contigo me voy a toa
Ey, espero que la hayas pasado bien
Y en verdad tu eres bien, pero
Mi vida es complicada, tu no va' a entender
Un poco inestable como puede' ver
Mami, fue rico conocerte
Pero no se si vuelva a verte

Esto es un ratito, uh-oh
Mami, no te acostumbres
Que el amor es muy bonito
Pero siempre hay algo que lo interrumpe

Pa' mi que yo naci pa' estar solo
(Pa' mi que yo naci pa' estar solo)
---------------------------------------------------
Haciendo de todo
Con ese pirobo

Hace mucho te queria ver
Cuando eras mi novia no salias y ahora hasta te gusta prender
El tiempo que pasamo' junto' como que lo dejamo' perder
Yo se que estoy borracho, pero recuerdo lo rico que bailamo', bebe

Tu y yo, bebe, haciendo de todo
Tu estas pa' andar con este gato, no con ese pirobo

Ando mezclando las pastillas con el romo
Y a tus ex novios yo les ofrezco plomo
To' los parceros hablandome de ti
Te mandaba canciones en el cole en un CD (Wow)
Estabamos a fuego y lo nuestro lo dividi
To'a la noche prendo y estoy pensando en ti
Yo se que estas cansada de tanto chimbiar
Buscando algo que no sera igual, yeah
El cuerpo que te hiciste lo quiero estrenar
Te compre una cadena pa' verte brillar

Tu y yo, bebe, haciendo de todo
Tu estas pa' andar con este gato, no con ese pirobo
Tu estas solita y yo tambien, tambien estoy solo
Tomate algo, vamos a perrear, a hacer de todo

Tu estas solita y yo tambien, tambien estoy solo

Welcome to your life
There's no turning back
Even while we sleep
We will find you

Acting on your best behaviour
Turn your back on mother nature
Everybody wants to rule the world

It's my own design
It's my own remorse
Help me to decide
Help me make the most

Of freedom and of pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever
Everybody wants to rule the world

There's a room where the light won't find you
Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down
When they do I'll be right behind you

So glad we've almost made it
So sad they had to fade it
Everybody wants to rule the world

I can't stand this indecision
Married with a lack of vision
Everybody wants to rule the world
Say that you'll never never never never need it
One headline why believe it?
Everybody wants to rule the world

All for freedom and for pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever
Everybody wants to rule the world

Car rides to Malibu
Strawberry ice cream, one spoon for two
And tradin' jackets
Laughin' 'bout how small it looks on you
(Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha)
Watching reruns of Glee
Bein' annoying, singin' in harmony
I bet she's braggin'
To all her friends, sayin' you're so unique, hmm

So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused
That was our place, I found it first
I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you

Do you get deja vu when she's with you?
Do you get deja vu? Ah, hmm
Do you get deja vu, huh?

Do you call her, almost say my name?
'Cause let's be honest, we kinda do sound the same
Another actress
I hate to think that I was just your type
And I bet that she knows Billy Joel
'Cause you played her "Uptown Girl"
You're singin' it together
Now I bet you even tell her how you love her
In between the chorus and the verse (I love you)

So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused
That was the show we talked about
Played you the song she's singing now when she's with you

Do you get deja vu when she's with you?
Do you get deja vu? (Oh-oh)
Do you get deja vu?

Strawberry ice cream in Malibu
Don't act like we didn't do that shit, too
You're tradin' jackets like we used to do
(Yeah, everything is all reused)
Play her piano, but she doesn't know
That I was the one who taught you Billy Joel
A different girl now, but there's nothing new

I know you get deja vu
I know you get deja vu
I know you get deja vu
---------------------------------------------------
I think I, I think I finally
Found a way to forgive myself
From mistakes I made in my past
I think that's the first step, right?
You agree?

I've dug two graves for us, my dear
Can't pretend that I was perfect, leavin' you in fear
Oh, man, what a world, the things I hear
If I could act on my revenge, then, oh, would I?
Some kill, some steal, some break your heart
And you thought that I would let it go and let you walk
Well, broken hearts break bones, so break up fast
And I don't wanna let it go, so in my grave I'll rot
I've dug two graves for us, my dear
Can't pretend that I was perfect, leavin' you in fear
Oh, man, what a world, the things I hear
If I could act on my revenge, then, oh, would I?
Some kill, some steal, some break your heart
And you thought that I would let it go and let you walk
Broken hearts break bones, so break up fast
And I don't wanna let it go, so in my grave I'll rot

In my grave, I'll rot
In my grave, I'll rot
In my grave, I'll rot-ot-ot
In my grave, I'll rot
In my grave, I'll rot-ot-ot
In my grave, I'll rot

In my grave, I'll rot
I'll rot, I'll rot, I'll rot
Is my pain your freedom?
Is all of my pain your freedom?
Enjoy

I still remember
Third of December
Me in your sweater
You said it looked better

On me, than it did you
Only if you knew
How much I liked you
But I watch your eyes, as she

Walks by
What a sight for
Sore eyes
Brighter than a
Blue sky
She's got you
Mesmerized
While I die

Why would you ever kiss me?
I'm not even half as pretty
You gave her your sweater
It's just polyester, but you like her better
Wish I were Heather

Watch as she stands with
Her holding your hand
Put your arm 'round her shoulder
Now I'm getting colder

But how could I hate her?
She's such an angel
But then again, kinda
Wish she were dead, as she

Walks by
What a sight for
Sore eyes
Brighter than a
Blue sky
She's got you
Mesmerized
While I die

Why would you ever kiss me?
I'm not even half as pretty
You gave her your sweater
It's just polyester, but you like her better
I wish I were Heather

Wish I were Heather
Wish I were Heather

Why would you ever kiss me?
I'm not even half as pretty
You gave her your sweater
It's just polyester
But you like her better
Wish I were
---------------------------------------------------
You've been my muse for a long time
You get me through every dark night
I'm always gone, out on the go
I'm on the run and you're home alone
I'm too consumed with my own life

Are we too young for this?
Feels like I can't move

Sharing my heart
It's tearing me apart
But I know I'd miss you, baby, if I left right now
Doing what I can, tryna be a man
And every time I kiss you, baby
I can hear the sound of breaking down

I've been confused as of late (Yeah)
Watching my youth slip away (Yeah)
You're like the sun, you wake me up
But you drain me out if I get too much
I might need you or I'll break

Are we too young for this?
Feels like I can't move

Sharing my heart
It's tearing me apart
But I know I'd miss you, baby, if I left right now
Doing what I can, tryna be a man
And every time I kiss you, baby
I can hear the sound of breaking down

Breaking down, breaking down, breaking down
Breaking down, breaking down, breaking down

I don't want to play this part
But I do all for you
I don't want to make this hard
But I will 'cause I'm still

Sharing my heart
It's tearing me apart
But I know I'd miss you, baby, if I left right now (I know I would)
Doing what I can, tryna be a man (Be your man)
And every time I kiss you, baby
I can hear the sound of breaking down

Sharing my bed, uh
Sharing my bread, yeah
Sharing my bread
Sharing my head
(I'm breaking down)
Sharing my heart
Sharing my, suddenly I'm
(Breaking down)
Sharing, I'm done
Sharing my life
---------------------------------------------------
The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go (mmmm)
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow (mmmm)
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now (mmmm)
Take my hand, stop, put Van The Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance
And now I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead (mmmm)

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body

Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date (mmmm)
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate (mmmm)
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay (mmmm)
And leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play
And I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead (mmmm)

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body

Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I

Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on

I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

¿Por que lo mas rico siempre es prohibido?
¿Pa' que tu estas con el, si quieres estar conmigo?
No soy maleante, pero contigo me la vivo
Corriendo motora y fumando al escondido
Si supiera' las loqueras que te escribo
Y que asi me llames triste, baby, yo me activo
Los mejores polvos han sido contigo
Hasta los pana' me dicen que estoy desaparecido, yeah

Parce, era en el mismo cuarto, en el mismo hotel
Vamos a poner en modo avion el cel
Voy bajando, voy en la DT
Vamo' a tirarno' una foto para el TBT
Cincuenta y cinco en la muneca
Me la engancho pa'l barrio y pa' la discoteca
Contigo es real, lo demas es feka
No copia de chavo' ni de camioneta'
Tu estas sonando conmigo y despertandote con el
Ni siquiera tienes mi nombre guardado en el cel
'Ta cabron que solo yo se como tocarte la piel
Si tu fuera' un carro, solo yo te se correr

¿Por que lo mas rico siempre es prohibido?
¿Pa' que tu estas con el, si quieres estar conmigo?
No soy maleante, pero contigo me la vivo
Corriendo motora y fumando al escondido
Si supiera' las loqueras que te escribo
Y que asi me llames triste, baby, yo me activo
Los mejores polvos han sido contigo
Hasta los pana' me dicen que estoy desaparecido
¿Por que lo mas rico siempre es prohibido?
¿Pa' que tu estas con el, si quieres estar conmigo?
No soy maleante, pero contigo me la vivo
Corriendo motora y fumando al escondido
---------------------------------------------------
(Look out for yourself)

I wake up to the sounds
Of the silence that allows
For my mind to run around
With my ear up to the ground

I'm searching to behold
The stories that are told
When my back is to the world
That was smiling when I turned

Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn they hate us

Oh the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be
My enemy-y-y-y-y
(Look out for yourself)
My enemy(Look)-y(Look)-y(Look)-y(Look)-y
(Look out for yourself)
But I'm ready

Your words up on the wall
As you're praying for my fall
And the laughter in the halls
And the names that I've been called

I stack it in my mind
And I'm waiting for the time
When I show you what it's like
To be words spit in a mic

Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn they hate us
(Huh)

Oh the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be
My enemy(Look)-y(Look)-y(Look)-y(Look)-y
(Look out for yourself)
My enemy(Look)-y(Look)-y(Look)-y(Look)-y
(Look out for yourself)


Uh, look, okay
I'm hoping that somebody pray for me
I'm praying that somebody hope for me
I'm staying where nobody 'posed to be
P-P-Posted
Being a wreck of emotions
Ready to go whenever, just let me know
The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor
The enemy's on my trail, my energy unavailable
I'ma tell 'em hasta luego
They wanna plot on my trot to the top
I've been outta shape
Thinkin' out the box
I'm an astronaut
I blasted off the planet rock
To cause catastrophe
And it matters more because I had it not
Had I thought about wreaking havoc on an opposition
Kinda shocking they wanted static
With precision, I'm automatic, quarterback, I ain't talkin' sacking
Pack it, pack it up, I don't panic
Batter, batter up
Who the baddest?
It don't matter 'cause we at ya throat


Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be
My enemy
Oh the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be
My enemy
(Pray it away, I swear)
(I'll never be a saint, no way)
My enemy
(Pray it away, I swear)
(I'll never be a saint)

(Look out for yourself)

Put your loving hand out, baby
'Cause I'm beggin'

I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, darlin'

Riding high when I was king
I played it hard and fast, 'cause I had everything
I walked away, you won me then
But easy come and easy go and it would end

So, anytime I bleed, you let me go
Yah, anytime I feed, you get me know
Anytime I seek, you let me know
But I planted that seed, just let me go
I'm on my knees when I'm beggin'
'Cause I don't wanna lose you
Hey, yeah, ra-ta-ta-ta!

'Cause I'm beggin', beggin' you
Uh, put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you, ah
And put your loving hand out, darlin'

I need you to understand
Tried so hard to be your man
The kind of man you want in the end
Only then can I begin to live again

An empty shell, I used to be
The shadow of my life was hangin' over me
A broken man that I don't know
Won't even stand the devil's dance to win my soul

What we doin'? What we chasin'?
Why the bottom? Why the basement?
Why we got good shit, don't embrace it?
Why the feel for the need to replace me?
You're the wrong way track from the good
I want to paint a picture tellin' where we could be at
Like a heart in the best way should
You can give it away, you had it and you took the pay
But I keep walkin' on, keep openin' doors
Keep hopin' for, now the door is yours
Keep also home
'Cause I don't want to live in a broken home, girl, I'm beggin'

Mmm, yeah-yeah, yeah, I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, darlin'

I'm fighting hard to hold my own
Just can't make it all alone
I'm holding on, I can't fall back
I'm just a calm, 'bout to fade to black

I'm beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, darlin'
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, darlin'

I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out

No me importa lo que de mi se diga
Viva usted su vida, que yo vivo la mia
Que solo e' una, disfruta el momento
Que el tiempo se acaba y pa'tras no vira

Bebiendo, fumando y jodiendo
Sigo vacilando de party to' los dia'
Y siguelo, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh (¡Farru!)
Siguelo, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh (La rola y pepa)

Pepa' y agua pa' la seca
To' el mundo en pastilla en la discoteca
Pepa' y agua pa' la seca
To' el mundo en pastilla en la discoteca

Desacata'o
Empastilla'o
(Que maldita nota)
(Arcoiris)
¡Fa-Farru!

Sube las mano' y las botella' pa' arriba (¡Blep!)
Siempre la movie la tenemo' prendia'
Hoy vamo' a darle hasta que se haga de dia
Sigo rulin, 'toy en la mia

Salio el sol, wol (Sol)
Traeme la hookah y el alcohol (Y el alcohol)
Y prendelo, oh-oh, woh-oh-oh (Woh-oh)
Esto se salio de control (De control)
Y siguelo, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh (La rola y pepa)

Pepa' y agua pa' la seca

Yeah
Rest in peace to all the kids that lost their lives in the Parkland shooting. This song is dedicated to you

OK, she keep crying, she keep crying every single night
Day and night, on my mind, please don't kill the vibe
Oh no, I swear to God, I be in my mind
Swear I wanna die, yeah, when you cross my

Said I wanna die, yuh, no, I'm not alright, yuh
I might start a riot, yuh, I'm so fuckin' tired, yuh
So what's up? What you say? Feelin' good, I'm feelin' great
Tired of the fuckin' hate, stackin' cheese all on my plate

So outside my misery, I think I'll find
A way of envisioning a better life
For the rest of us, the rest of us
There's hope for the rest of us, the rest of us

OK, she keep crying, she keep crying every single night
Day and night, on my mind, please don't kill the vibe
Oh no, I swear to God, I be in my mind
Swear I wanna die, yeah, when you cross my

Said I wanna die, yuh, no, I'm not alright, yuh
I might start a riot, yuh, I'm so fuckin' tired, yuh
So what's up? What you say? Feelin' good, I'm feelin' great
Tired of the fuckin' hate, stackin' cheese all on my plate

Every breath you take
And every move you make
Every bond you break
Every step you take
I'll be watching you
Every single day
And every word you say
Every game you play
Every night you stay

Oh, can't you see you belong to me?
How my poor heart aches with every step you take

Every move you make
And every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake
I'll be watching you

Since you've gone, I've been lost without a trace
I dream at night, I can only see your face
I look around, but it's you I can't replace
I feel so cold, and I long for your embrace
I keep crying baby, baby, please

Mm, mm, mm, mm
Mm, mm, mm

Oh, can't you see you belong to me?
How my poor heart aches with every step you take

Every move you make
And every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake

Every step you take
I'll be watching you

I'll be watching you

Salt air
And the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers
Of "Are you sure?"
"Never have I ever before"

But I can see us
Lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away
Like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

Your back
Beneath the sun
Wishing I could write my name on it
Will you call when you're back at school?
I remember thinking I had you

But I can see us
Lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away
Like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

Back when we were still changing for the better
Wanting was enough
For me, it was enough
To live for the hope of it all
Cancel plans just in case you'd call
And say "Meet me behind the mall"
So much for summer love, and saying "Us"
'Cause you weren't mine to lose
You weren't mine to lose
No

But I can see us
Lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away
Like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine, mine

'Cause you were never mine
Never mine
But do you remember?
Remember when I pulled up
And said "Get in the car"
And then canceled my plans
Just in case you'd call?
Back when I was living for the hope of it all
For the hope of it all
"Meet me behind the mall"

(Remember when I pulled up)
(And said "Get in the car")
(And then canceled my plans)
(Just in case you'd call?)
(Back when I was living for the hope of it all)
(For the hope of it all)
("Meet me behind the mall")

Remember when I pulled up
And said "Get in the car"
And then canceled my plans
Just in case you'd call?
Back when I was living for the hope of it all
(For the hope of it all)
For the hope of it all
For the hope of it all
For the hope of it all
For the hope of it all

Sunday mornings were your favorite
I used to meet you down on Woods Creek Road
You did your hair up like you were famous
Even though it's only church where we were going
Now Sunday mornings, I just sleep in
It's like I've buried my faith with you
I'm screaming at a God, I don't know if I believe in
'Cause I don't know what else I can do

I'm still holding on to everything that's dead and gone
I don't wanna say goodbye 'cause this one means forever
Now you're in the stars and six-feet's never felt so far
Here I am alone between the heavens and the embers
Oh, it hurts so hard for a million different reasons
You took the best of my heart and left the rest in pieces

Digging through your old birthday letters
A crumpled twenty still in the box
I don't think that I could ever find a way to spend it
Even if it's the last twenty that I've got

Oh, I'm still holding on to everything that's dead and gone
I don't wanna say goodbye 'cause this one means forever
Now you're in the stars and six-feet's never felt so far
Here I am alone between the heavens and the embers
Oh, it hurts so hard for a million different reasons
You took the best of my heart and left the rest in pieces

I'm still holding (On), holding (On), holding on
I'm still holding (On), holding (On), holding on
I'm still holding (On), holding (On), I'm still holding on
I'm still... ooh, still holding on

I'm still holding on to everything that's dead and gone
I don't wanna say goodbye 'cause this one means forever
Now you're in the stars and six-feet's never felt so far
Here I am alone between the heavens and the embers
Oh, it hurts so hard for a million different reasons
You took the best of my heart and left the rest in pieces
---------------------------------------------------
I been a (G)
Throw up the (L)
Sex in the (A-M)
Uh-huh
(O-R-O-U-S, yeah)
And I could put you in (First class up in the sky)
I could put you in (First class up in the s-, up-up in the s-)

I been a (G)
Throw up the (L)

Uh-huh
(O-R-O-U-S, yeah)
And I could put you in (First class up in the sky)
I could put you in (First class up in the s-, up-up in the s-)

I can see the whole city from this balcony
Back in 2019, I was outside freely
But now they got it out for me
I don't care what frat that you was in, you came out for me
Keep dreamin', pineapple juice like it was sweet, sweet, sweet (Seemin')
I know what they like, so I just keep cheesin'
Hard drive full of heat-seekin'
Tryna come the same day as Jack? Rethink it
You don't need Givenchy, you need Jesus
Why do y'all sleep on me? I need reasons

Uh, I got plaques in the mail, peak season
Shoutout to my UPS workers makin' sure I receive 'em
You can do it, too, believe it

I been a (G)
Throw up the (L)
Sex in the (A-M)
Uh-huh
(O-R-O-U-S, yeah)
And I could put you in (First class up in the sky)
I could put you in (First class up in the s-, up-up in the s-)

(Are you ready?)
Yes I am

They say you a superstar now, damn, I guess I am
You might be the man, well, that's unless I am
Okay, I'll confess, I am
"Go ahead and get undressed", "I am"
"Okay, cool, you on Sunset? ", "I am"
I'm 'bout to slide, okay, I'm outside, okay
This lifestyle don't got many downsides
'Cept for the lack of time I get 'round my
Family, makin' sure they never downsize
I got visions of my mom saying, "Wait, this house mine?"
Can't lie, I'm on Angus Cloud nine
I got him on the bandwagon now, 'bout time
I ain't even got no downtime
Every time I speak, she say, "Yeah, that sounds fine"

I been a (G)
Throw up the (L)
Sex in the (A-M)
Uh-huh
(O-R-O-U-S, yeah)
And I could put you in (First class up in the sky)
I could put you in (First class up in the s-, up-up in the s-)

4 de la manana y Andrea saliendo de La Perla
Mucho' la critican sin conocerla
Calle como un Civic, inteligente como un Tesla
Sonando con alguien que pueda comprenderla
Y no quiera cambiarla, solo quererla, ey, solo quererla
De la IUPI pa' la Inter, de la Inter pa' Sagrado
Equivocandose de amore' en lo que llega el indicado
Quiere quedarse en PR, no irse pa' ningun estado
Pero todo se ha complicado
Como si ser mujer fuera un pecado
La demonia ha despertado, ey
Una guerrera, una de arco, temperamental, nunca malco
A la buena, beso y abrazo
A la mala, botellazo sin soltar el vaso
Le gustaba el basquet, leer, tu y hacerse lazo'
Pero de esa nina solo quedan pedazo'
Se ha buscado un par de caso'
Por no aguantarle chiste' a ningun payaso, ey
Mirala como camina
Lo que le falta e' la tarima
Cansada de esperar propina y de lo que su familia opina
Pa' colmo ahora el gobierno la llama "asesina"
Una diva campesina
Chico, quedate en tu esquina, ey
Y no pida rosa' si no aguanta' espina'

No quiero que nadie me diga lo que yo tengo que hacer
Si con el no hablare, conmigo veran, no van a joder
Que digan lo que sea
Yo subo y bajo como la marea
Se tratan de montar y tambalean
Quiero alguien que se atreva, que se atreva
Y me entienda a mi

Una loca que no quiere un loco
Quiere vino tinto y sushi de Yoko
Dias de playita, helado de coco
Se merece tanto y recibe tan poco
La mai reza por un doctor, ingeniero
Y ella con bichote' y rapero'
Mi prima dice que e' un cuero
Y lo que nadie sabe es que a su corazon le hace falta un suero (Eh-ah)
Chinga cabron, se comenta
Y aunque la ven jangueando toda la semana, no se ve contenta, no
Lo malo siempre se sabe y lo bueno nunca se cuenta
Joseando pa' la renta, llorando mas de la cuenta
No hay mujer sin herida' ni hombre que no mienta
Ey, ella no quiere una flor, solo quiere que no la marchiten
Que cuando compre pan, no le piten
Que no le pregunten que hizo ayer
Y un futuro lindo le inviten
Que le den respeto y nunca se lo quiten
Que le den respeto y nunca se lo qu
Que, que le den respeto y nunca se lo quiten
No, nunca se lo quiten
Porque ella es jefa, patrona
Y aunque casi casi por dentro se desmorona
Se acicala y se ve cabrona
Se acicala y se ve cabrona
La vida va como Verstappen en Formula 1
Y Buddy Baker en Daytona, ey
Andrea hace tweet "que se mamen un bicho las persona'

No quiero que nadie me diga lo que yo tengo que hacer
Si con el no hablare, conmigo veran, no van a joder
Que digan lo que sea
Yo subo y bajo como la marea
Se tratan de montar y tambalean
Quiero alguien que se atreva, que se atreva
Y me entienda a mi

A mi nene yo lo encuentro funny, funny
Sigo mi sueno y buscando ese money
Que no hay money, que no hay money
Que yo sigo buscando ese honey, ese honey
A bailar, a bailar
Que digan lo que sea
---------------------------------------------------
You high, baby?
Yeah
Ya
Talk to me
You want me to tell you something?
Uh-huh
I know what you wanna hear

'Cause I know you want me baby
I think I want you too
"I think I love you baby"
I think I love you too
I'm here to save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
I wanna grow together
Let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me baby
You know I want you too
They call me Superman
I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
"Ooh boy you drive me crazy"
Bitch you make me hurl

They call me Superman
Leap tall hoes in a single bound
I'm single now
Got no ring on this finger now
I'd never let another chick bring me down
In a relationship
Save it bitch, babysit
You make me sick
Superman ain't savin' shit
Girl you can jump on Shady's dick
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
I tell a motherfuckin' slut to her face
Play no games, say no names
Ever since I broke up with what's-her-face
I'm a different man, kiss my ass
Kiss my lips, bitch why ask?
Kiss my dick, get my cash
I'd rather have you whip my ass
Don't put out, I'll put you out
Won't get out, I'll push you out
Puss blew out, poppin' shit
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out
Am I too nice?
Buy you ice
Bitch if you died, wouldn't buy you life
What you tryin' to be? My new wife?
What you Mariah, fly through twice

But I do know one thing though
Bitches, they come they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway ho

'Cause I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Your Superman, your Superman

Don't get me wrong, I love these hoes
It's no secret, everybody knows
Yeah we fucked, bitch so what?
That's about as far as your buddy goes
We'll be friends, I'll call you again
I'll chase you around every bar you attend
Never know what kinda car I'll be in
We'll see how much you'll be partying then
You don't want that, neither do I
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride between you and I
Not a jealous man, but females lie
But I guess that's just what sluts do
How could it ever be just us two
I'd never love you enough to trust you
We just met and I just fucked you

But I do know one thing though
Bitches, they come they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway ho

'Cause I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Your Superman, your Superman

'Cause I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Your Superman, your Superman

'Cause I know you want me baby
I think I want you too
"I think I love you baby"
I think I love you too
I'm here to save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
I wanna grow together
Let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me baby
You know I want you too
They call me Superman
I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
"Ooh boy you drive me crazy"
Bitch you make me hurl

First thing you say
"I'm not fazed, I hang around big stars all day
I don't see what the big deal is anyway
You're just plain old Marshall to me"
Ooh yeah girl run that game
"Hailie Jade, I love that name
Love that tattoo, what's that say?"
"Rot in pieces, uh, that's great"
First off you don't know Marshall
At all so don't grow partial
That's ammo for my arsenal
I'll slap you off that bar stool
There goes another lawsuit
Leave hand prints all across you
Good Lordy whoadie
You must be gone off that water bottle
You want what you can't have
Ooh girl that's too damn bad
Don't touch what you can't grab
End up with two backhands
Put anthrax on a Tampax, and slap you 'til you can't stand
Girl you just blew your chance
Don't mean to ruin your plans

But I do know one thing though
Bitches, they come they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway ho

'Cause I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Your Superman, your Superman

'Cause I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Your Superman, your Superman

'Cause I know you want me baby
I think I want you too
"I think I love you baby"
I think I love you too
I'm here to save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
I wanna grow together
Let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me baby
You know I want you too
They call me Superman
I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
"Ooh boy you drive me crazy"
Bitch you make me hurl

'Cause I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Your Superman, your Superman

'Cause I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Your Superman, your Superman

Yeah, I've been throwin' down the whiskey
I oughta get my money back
And someone said it drowns the memory
Aw, but it ain't doin' jack
Yeah, I've been sippin', I've been buzzin'
Shootin' doubles like it's nothin'
Aw, but nothin' makes you go away

I need something "You proof"
Somethin' stronger than I'm used to
Yeah, I've been pullin' 90 to 100
Feel like nothin's gonna cut it, that's the hard truth
Yeah, I need something "You proof"
Aw, I need something "You proof"

Poured 'em up till they're shutting 'em down, yeah
You never ain't not around, yeah
Don't matter what time or town, I can't get you gone
Turned the bar, yeah, upside down
Just lookin' for somethin' that does it
I'd give 'em all my money

Ain't nobody sellin' nothing "You proof"
Somethin' stronger than I'm used to
Yeah, I've been pullin' 90 to 100
Feel like nothin's gonna cut it, that's the hard truth
Yeah, I need something "You proof"
Aw, I need something "You proof"

Hey, I've been mixing liquors tryin' to get you gone
Aw, but I must be doin' somethin' wrong
'Cause I've been working hard to fade your memory
Baby, but the only thing faded is me

I need something "You proof"
Somethin' stronger than I'm used to
Yeah, I've been pullin' 90 to 100
Feel like nothin's gonna cut it, that's the hard truth
I need something "You proof"
Poured 'em up till they're shutting 'em down, yeah
Aw, I need something "You proof"
You never ain't not around, yeah

Don't matter what time or town, I can't get you gone
Turned the bar, yeah, upside down
Just lookin' for somethin' that does it
I'd give up all my money
Ain't nobody sellin' nothing "You proof"
---------------------------------------------------
Don't kill me, just help me run away
From everyone, I need a place to stay
Where I can cover up my face
Don't cry, I am just a freak

I am just a freak
I am just a freak
I am just a freak

My head is filled with parasites
Black holes cover up my eyes
I dream of you almost every night
Hopefully I won't wake up this time

I won't wake up this time
I won't wake up this time
I won't wake up this time
---------------------------------------------------
'Cause sometimes you just feel tired
Yo, left, yo, left
Feel weak and when you feel weak
Yo, left, right, left
You feel like you wanna just give up
Yo, left, yo left
But you gotta search within you
Yo, left, right, left
Try to find that inner strength and just pull that shit out of you
Yo, left, yo left
And get that motivation to not give up
Yo, left, right, left
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad
Yo, left, yo left
You wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse
Yo, left, right, left

'Til I collapse I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em
'Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pennin' 'em
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin' 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal, cop-killin', hip-hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're comin' with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?
Fa' shizzle, my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck

'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
Until the roof, until the roof
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
Until my legs, until my legs
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
Give out from underneath me

Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get
When you real and you spit, and people are feelin' your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes: Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
Andre from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney  Nate, hit me!

'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
Until the roof, until the roof
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
Until my legs, until my legs
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
Give out from underneath me

Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll prob'ly never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em
The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?
'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so

'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
Until the roof, until the roof
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
Until my legs, until my legs
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
Give out from underneath me

Until the roof, until the roof
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
Until my legs, until my legs
Give out from underneath me
I, I will not fall, I will stand tall
Feels like no one could beat me
---------------------------------------------------
Once upon a younger year
When all our shadows disappeared
The animals inside came out to play
Went face to face with all our fears
Learned our lessons through the tears
Made memories we knew would never fade

One day my fatherhe told me
"Son, don't let it slip away"
He took me in his arms, I heard him say

"When you get older
Your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid"

He said, "One day you'll leave this world behind
So, live a life you will remember"
My father told me when I was just a child
"These are the nights that never die"
My father told me

"When thunder clouds start pouring down
Light a fire they can't put out
Carve your name into those shining stars"
He said, "Go venture far beyond the shores
Don't forsake this life of yours
I'll guide you home no matter where you are"

One day my fatherhe told me
"Son, don't let it slip away"
When I was just a kid I heard him say

"When you get older
Your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid"

He said, "One day you'll leave this world behind
So, live a life you will remember"
My father told me when I was just a child
"These are the nights that never die"
My father told me

"These are the nights that never die"
My father told me
My father told me
---------------------------------------------------
I wanna follow where she goes
I think about her and she knows it
I wanna let her take control
'Cause every time that she gets close, yeah

She pulls me in enough to keep me guessing, mmm
And maybe I should stop and start confessing
Confessing, yeah

Oh, I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back

You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back

There's nothing holdin' me back
There's nothing holdin' me back

She says that she's never afraid
Just picture everybody naked
She really doesn't like to wait
Not really into hesitation

Pulls me in enough to keep me guessing, whoa
And maybe I should stop and start confessing
Confessing, yeah

Oh, I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back

You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back

There's nothing holdin' me back

'Cause if we lost our minds
And we took it way too far
I know we'd be alright,
Know we would be alright

If you were by my side
And we stumbled in the dark
I know we'd be alright,
I know we would be alright

'Cause if we lost our minds
And we took it way too far
I know we'd be alright,
I know we would be alright

If you were by my side
And we stumbled in the dark
I know we'd be alright,
We would be alright

Oh, I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back

You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back

There's nothing holdin' me back

I feel so free
When you're with me,
Baby

Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back

My track record so clean
They couldn't wait to just bash me
I must be gettin' too flashy
Y'all shouldn't let the world gas me (woo)
It's too late 'cause I'm here to stay and these girls know that I'm nasty
I sent her back to her boyfriend with my handprint on her ass cheek
City talkin', we takin' notes
Tell 'em all to keep makin' posts
Wish he could but he can't get close
OG so proud of me that he chokin' up while he makin' toasts
I'm the type that you can't control
Said I would then I made it so
I don't clear up rumors (aye)
Where's y'all sense of humor? (aye)
I'm done makin' jokes 'cause they got old like baby boomers
Turn my haters to consumers
I make vets feel like they're juniors (juniors)
Say your time is comin' soon but just like Oklahoma
Mine is comin' sooner
I'm just a late bloomer
I didn't peak in high school, I'm still out here gettin' cuter (woo)
All these social networks and computers
Got these pussies walkin' 'round like they ain't losers


I told you long ago, on the road
I got what they're waitin' for (I got what they're waitin' for)
I don't run from nothin', dog
Get your soldiers, tell 'em I ain't layin' low

Yeah

Left her baggage for Rimowa

Done bein' distracted
The one I need is right in my arms (Oh)
Your kisses taste the sweetest with mine
And I'll be right here with you 'til the end of time

Fuck you and your mom and your sister and your job
And your broke-ass car and that shit you call art
Fuck you and your friends that I'll never see again
Everybody but your dog, you can all fuck off

I swear I meant to mean the best when it ended
Even tried to bite my tongue when you start shit
Now you're textin' all my friends asking questions
They never even liked you in the first place
Dated a girl that I hate for the attention
She only made it two days, what a connection
It's like you'd do anythin' for my affection
You're goin' all about it in the worst ways

I was into you, but I'm over it now
And I was tryna be nice
But nothing's getting through, so let me spell it out

A-B-C-D-E, F you
And your mom and your sister and your job
And your broke-ass car and that shit you call art
Fuck you and your friends that I'll never see again
Everybody but your dog, you can all fuck off

Nah-nah-nah, nah-nah, nah, nah-nah
A-B-C-D-E, F you

You said you just needed space and so I gave it
When I had nothin' to say you couldn't take it
Told everyone I'm a bitch, so I became it
Always had to put yourself above me

I was into you, but I'm over it now
And I was tryna be nice
But nothing's getting through, so let me spell it out

A-B-C-D-E, F you
And your mom and your sister and your job
And your craigslist couch and the way your voice sounds
Fuck you and your friends that I'll never see again
Everybody but your dog, you can all fuck off

Nah-nah-nah, nah-nah, nah, nah-nah
A-B-C-D-E, F off (F off)
Nah-nah-nah, nah-nah, nah, nah-nah
A-B-C-D-E, F you

And your mom and your sister and your job
And your broke-ass car and that shit you call art
Fuck you and your friends that I'll never see again
Everybody but your dog, you can all fuck off

Coming out of my cage and I've been doing just fine
Gotta, gotta be down, because I want it all
It started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this?
It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss
Now I'm falling asleep and she's calling a cab
While he's having a smoke and she's taking a drag
Now they're going to bed and my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head, but she's touching his

Chest now, he takes off her
Dress now, let me go
And I just can't look, it's killing me
They're taking control

Jealousy, turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies, choking on your alibis
But it's just the price I pay, destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes, 'cause I'm Mr. Brightside

I'm coming out of my cage and I've been doing just fine
Gotta, gotta be down, because I want it all

While he's having a smoke and she's taking a drag

Open up my eager eyes, 'cause I'm Mr. Brightside

I never...
I never...
I never...
I never...

Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier
I want you to be happier

When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day, we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that the story ends

Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier
I want you to be happier

When the evening falls
And I'm left there with my thoughts
And the image of you being with someone else
Well, it's eating me up inside

But we ran our course, we pretended we're OK
Now if we jump together at least we can swing
Far away from the wreck we made

Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier
I want you to be happier

So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go

Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier
I want you to be happier
Even though I might not like this
I think that you'll be happier
I want you to be happier

Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier
I want you to be happier

So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go
---------------------------------------------------
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly (Fly)
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried (Cried, cried, cried, cried)
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care (Might care, might care)

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

And you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'"

I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

And you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'"

If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?
---------------------------------------------------
When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fucking special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts
I want to have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fucking special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

Oh, oh

She's running out again
She's running out
She run, run, run, run
Run

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fucking special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here
---------------------------------------------------
Baby this love, I'll never let it die
Can't be touched by no one, I'd like to see him try
I'm a mad man for your touch
Girl, I've lost control
I'm gonna make this last forever
Don't tell me it's impossible

'Cause I love you for infinity
I love you for infinity
'Cause I love you for infinity
I love you for infinity

Oh darling, my soul
You know it aches for your's
And you've been filling this hole since you were born
'Cause you're the reason I believe in fate
You're my paradise
And I'll do anything to be your love, or be your sacrifice

'Cause I love you for infinity
I love you for infinity
'Cause I love you for infinity
I love you for infinity

Meet me at the bottom of the ocean
Where the time is frozen
Where all the universe is open
Love isn't random, we are chosen
And we could wear the same crown
Keep slowing your heart down
We are the gods now

'Cause I love you for infinity
I love you for infinity
'Cause I love you for infinity
I love you for infinity
---------------------------------------------------
It starts with one

One thing I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time


All I know

Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away


It's so unreal

It's so unreal, didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go


Watch you go

I kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when I tried so hard


I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter


One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard


I tried so hard

In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far


Got so far

Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end


In the end

You kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when I tried so hard


I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
---------------------------------------------------
I walked across an empty land
I knew the pathway like the back of my hand
I felt the earth beneath my feet
Sat by the river and it made me complete

Oh simple thing where have you gone?
I'm getting old and I need something to rely on
So tell me when you're gonna let me in
I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin

I came across a fallen tree
I felt the branches of it looking at me
Is this the place we used to love?
Is this the place that I've been dreaming of?

Oh simple thing where have you gone?
I'm getting old and I need something to rely on
So tell me when you're gonna let me in
I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin

And if you have a minute why don't we go
Talk about it somewhere only we know?
This could be the end of everything
So why don't we go
Somewhere only we know?
Somewhere only we know?

Oh simple thing where have you gone?
I'm getting old and I need something to rely on
So tell me when you're gonna let me in
I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin

And if you have a minute why don't we go
Talk about it somewhere only we know?
This could be the end of everything
So why don't we go?
So why don't we go?

Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah

This could be the end of everything
So why don't we go
Somewhere only we know?
Somewhere only we know?
Somewhere only we know?
---------------------------------------------------
Baby, I like your style

Grips on your waist
Front way, back way
You know that I don't play
Streets not safe
But I never run away
Even when I'm away
Oti, oti, there's never much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray, I pray

That's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me

Baby, I like your style

Strength and guidance
All that I'm wishing for my friends
Nobody makes it from my ends
I had to bust up the silence
You know you gotta stick by me
Soon as you see the text, reply me
I don't wanna spend time fighting
We've got no time

And that's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me

Got a pretty girl and she love me long time
Wine it, wine it, very long time
Oh yeah, very long time
Back up, back up, back up and wine it
Back up, back up and wine it, girl
Back up, back up, back up and wine it
Oh yeah, very long time
Back up, back up and wine it, girl

Tell me, I need to know, where do you wanna go?
'Cause if you're down, I'll take it slow
Make you lose control
Where, where, where
Where, where, where, where
Oh yeah, very long time
Where, where, where
Back up, back up and wine it, girl
Where, where, where, where
'Cause if you're down
Back up, back up and
'Cause if you're down
Back up, back up and
'Cause if you're down
Back up, back up and

I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
---------------------------------------------------
Here's to the ones that we got
Cheers to the wish you were here, but you're not
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
Of everything we've been through
Toast to the ones here today
Toast to the ones that we lost on the way
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
And the memories bring back, memories bring back you

There's a time that I remember, when I did not know no pain
When I believed in forever, and everything would stay the same
Now my heart feel like December when somebody say your name
'Cause I can't reach out to call you, but I know I will one day, yeah

Everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody hurts someday, ayy-ayy
But everything gon' be alright
Go and raise a glass and say, ayy

Cheers to the wish you were here, but you're not
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
Of everything we've been through
Toast to the ones here today
Toast to the ones that we lost on the way
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
And the memories bring back, memories bring back you

Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Memories bring back, memories bring back you

There's a time that I remember when I never felt so lost
When I felt all of the hatred was too powerful to stop (Ooh, yeah)
Now my heart feel like an ember and it's lighting up the dark
I'll carry these torches for ya that you know I'll never drop, yeah

Everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody hurts someday, ayy-ayy
But everything gon' be alright
Go and raise a glass and say, ayy

Memories bring back, memories bring back you

¿Que hubo, mi amor?
Otra vez los cachos
Piso 21
Manuel Turizo

Es verdad
Que la vieron tomando en la disco, pasandola rico a las 2 de la manana
Entonadita con los panas

Pero acabando una cancion
Su nombre entro en conversacion y le cambio la cara
Dice que pa' el la mala

No se le olvida que borracho
El le puso los cachos
No penso en lo que perdia por darselas de macho
Ahora la esta buscando
Le esta rogando, pero ya no esta pa' el
Mando a decir con los muchachos

Prefiere estar sola, a ser el segundo plato
Se puso mas buena de lo que se veia
Esta feliz, ya no llora hace rato
Si sale de noche, regresa de dia

Si la quiere ver, pues que mire los retratos
Lo dejo y dijo que no volvia
Si fuera el, te lo juro que ni trato
Perdio el oro buscando fantasia

Botellas bajando y la fiesta prendiendose
Si es por mi, yo estuviera besandote
Se grabo con su amiga perreando
Dice que las penas se olvidan tomando

Es mas, ven y pegate, no lo bloquees de Insta
Pa' que te vea hasta que yo te desvista
No le escribas, mejor que tu ni existas
Lo que se va no vuelve, ni porque tu le insistas

Aunque le duele, ya no vuelve pa' atras
No vuelve pa' atras, no vuelve pa' atras
El la dejo y ella no mira pa' atras
No mira pa' atras, no, no

No se le olvida que borracho
El le puso los cachos
No penso en lo que perdia por darselas de macho
Y ahora la esta buscando
La esta buscando, pero ya no esta pa' el
Mando a decir con los muchachos

Y aunque le duele, ya no vuelve pa' atras
Ya no vuelve pa' atras, ya no vuelve pa' atras
El la busco, pero no mira pa' atras
Ya no mira pa' atras, no, no

Y aunque le duele, ya no vuelve pa' atras
Ya no vuelve pa' atras, ya no vuelve pa' atras
El la busco, pero no mira pa' atras
Ya no mira pa' atras, no, no

Dice que prefiere estar sola, que mal acompana'
Esta con el corazon cerrao y la cabeza dana'
Gracias a Dios se libro del que la tenia engana'
Que si el exnovio esta en el club, que no la lleven pa' alla

Que eso le dana el dia
Esta para la rebeldia
Tiene un culito que Ave Maria
Un trago a ella la pone contenta
Dos tragos y ese man se le olvida

Pero acabando una cancion
Su nombre entro en conversacion y le cambio la cara
Dice que pa' el la mala

No se le olvida que borracho
El le puso los cachos
No penso en lo que perdia por darselas de macho
Y ahora la esta buscando
La esta buscando, pero ya no esta pa' el
Mando a decir con los muchachos

Es verdad
Que la vieron tomando en la disco, pasandola rico a las 2 de la manana
Entonadita con sus panas

Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start

They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me


So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost

I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
Hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans

Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game made for everyone
And love is the prize


So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost

Didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know (didn't know, didn't know)
---------------------------------------------------
Back in black, I hit the sack
I've been too long, I'm glad to be back
Yes, I'm let loose from the noose
That's kept me hanging about
I'm just looking at the sky 'cause it's getting me high
Forget the hearse, 'cause I'll never die
I got nine lives, cat's eyes
Abusing every one of them and running wild

'Cause I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, back
Well, I'm back in black
Yes, I'm back in black

Back in the back of a Cadillac
Number one with a bullet, I'm a power pack
Yes, I'm in a bang with a gang
They've got to catch me if they want me to hang
'Cause I'm back on the track and I'm beatin' the flack
Nobody's gonna get me on another rap
So, look at me now, I'm just making my play
Don't try to push your luck, just get out of my way

'Cause I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, back
Well, I'm back in black
Yes, I'm back in black

Well, I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, back
Well, I'm back in black
Yes, I'm back in black, yow

Ah, yeah
Oh, yeah
Take my love
Yeah, yeah
Yeah
Ah, hey yeah
Ooh, yeah

Well, I'm back (I'm back)
Back, well I'm (I'm back)
Back (I'm back)
Back (I'm back)
Back (I'm back)
Back, back in black
Yes, I'm back in black

I've hit the sack
---------------------------------------------------
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray, but your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray, but your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad, it's not so bad


Dear Slim, I wrote you but you still ain't calling
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or something
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways; fuck it, what's been up? Man, how's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant, too, I'm bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'mma call her?
I'mma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie, too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus, too, that shit was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan
This is Stan


My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray, but your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad, it's not so bad


Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad - I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
You didn't have to, but you could've signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you
For four hours and you just said, "No"
That's pretty shitty man - you're like his fucking idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like being lied to
Remember when we met in Denver - you said if I'd write you
You would write back - see I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
'Cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growing up
You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan
P.S.
We should be together, too


My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray, but your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad, it's not so bad


Dear Mister I'm-Too-Good-To-Call-Or-Write-My-Fans,
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word. I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters;
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins "In the Air Tonight"
About that guy who could've saved that other guy from drowning
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is, you could've rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late. I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I loved you, Slim, we could've been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See, Slim,shut up bitch! I'm trying to talk!
Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screaming in the trunk,
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up. See, I ain't like you
'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die, too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?



My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray, but your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad, it's not so bad


Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I've just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother
I wrote it on the Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists, too?
I say that shit's just clowning , dawg
C'mon! How fucked up is you?
You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counseling
To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doing just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but, Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about it, his name was... it was you
Damn!
---------------------------------------------------
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
This is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out and take me home
You're my, my, my, my
Lover

We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Lover

Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my
Lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be over-dramatic and true to my
Lover

And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat
Lover

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Darling, you're my, my, my, my
Lover
---------------------------------------------------
This night is cold in the kingdom
I can feel you fade away
From the kitchen to the bathroom sink and
Your steps keep me awake

Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
I once was a man with dignity and grace
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
So please, please

Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me

If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly

Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down
Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down

If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly

Cold skin, drag my feet on the tile
As I'm walking down the corridor
And I know we haven't talked in a while
So I'm looking for an open door

Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
I once was a man with dignity and grace
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
So please, please

Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me

If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly

Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down
Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down

If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly

And I can't stop myself from falling down
And I can't stop myself from falling down
And I can't stop myself from falling down
And I can't stop myself from falling down

Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me

If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly

Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down
Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down

If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly

If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly
---------------------------------------------------
I wanna fuck you slow with the lights on (Lights on, lights on, lights on)
You're the only one I've got my sights on (Sights on, sights on, sights on)
Type of sex you could never put a price on (Price on, price on, price on)
I'll take it off, you're the one I'll roll the dice on (Dice on, dice on, dice on)
And I just want a baby with the right one
(I just want a baby with the right)
'Cause I could never be the one to hide one
(I could never be the one to hide)

And we lost a lot of things in the fire
So it took a year for me to find out (Find out, find out)

I can't lose you, babe (I can't lose you)
I can't lose you, babe (I can't lose you, babe)
I can't lose you, babe (I can't lose you, babe)

I can't lose you, babe
Oh-oh (Yeah)

I'm tired of being home alone (Home alone)
I used to have a girl a day (Girl a day)
But I want you to stay (I want you to stay, hey)
You said you might be into girls (Into girls)
Said you're going through a phase (Through a phase)
Keeping your heart safe (Keepin' your heart safe, oh)
Well, baby, you can bring a friend (Bring a friend)
She can ride on top your face (Top your face)
While I fuck you straight (While I fuck you straight, yeah)

And we lost a lot of things in the fire (Fire)
So it took a year for me to find out (Find out, find out)

I can't lose you, babe (I can't lose you)
I can't lose you, babe (I can't lose you, babe)
I can't lose you, babe (I can't lose you, babe)
Oh-oh (Oh-oh, oh-oh)

Oh-oh (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)

Ooh
---------------------------------------------------
I got the words "I love you"
Sitting on the tip of my tongue

At your house again
Are we more than friends?
There's so much that I wanna say
But I gotta hold it back
So scared how you'll react
I just hide it all away

I could give you it all
In a minute could fall
Any minute but we go 'round and 'round
I don't wanna mention commitment
But I feel it slippin'
So please don't let me down
Me down

I got the words "I love you"
Sitting on the tip of my tongue
Oh I feel like
As soon as they leave my mouth
You're just gonna get up and run
You're gonna run away

You know we connect
More than just the sex
But are you gonna let me in?

I could set your world on fire
But you're holding the lighter
Instead you're putting out our flame

I could give you it all
In a minute could fall
Any minute but we go round and round
I don't wanna mention commitment
But I feel it slippin'
So please don't let me down

I got the words "I love you"
Sitting on the tip of my tongue
Oh I feel like
As soon as they leave my mouth
You're just gonna get up and run
You're gonna run away (Run)
Run away (Run)
Run away (Run)

I got the words "I love you"
Sitting on the tip of my tongue
Oh I feel like
As soon as they leave my mouth
You're just gonna get up and run
You're gonna run away

If I say it now
Then one day I'll wake up and you've walked out

So I'll just stay here with the words "I love you"
Sitting on the tip of my tongue
---------------------------------------------------
Ey, ey

El que este libre de pecado que tire una piedra y yo tiro un penon, yo tiro un penon
Anoche sone contigo y me levante grunon
Bebiendo desde temprano, Dios me cuide el higado y rinon, ey, ey, ey
Extranando to'as las noche' de caviar y mignon
Ahora eres de fuego como Olga Tanon, je
Y en el cora me dejaste el Gran Canon
Tu y yo eramo' los Thunder y se rompio el equipo
Ayer te vieron dizque en Fifty-Eight con otro tipo
Yo tambien ando con una galla que con ella flipo
Y no, no

Yo no soy celoso, pero ¿quien e' ese cabron?
Dime quien e' ese cabron
Tranquila, no soy psycho
No vo'a hacer un papelon, pero
Auch, mi corazon
Yo no soy celoso, pero ¿quien e' ese cabron?
Dime quien e' ese cabron
Tranquila, no soy psycho
No vo'a hacer un papelon, pero
Auch, mi corazon, eh

Wow, se que soy un caripela'o, encojona'o por eso
Cuando con ma' de mil he esta'o, a cuantas no le' he da'o, je
Pero tranquila, que yo mismo me tengo amenaza'o
Yo se lo que tenia, lo que no sabia e' que se sentia perderlo
Si Beto lo enrola voy a prenderlo, si traen perico vo'a huelerlo
El cora y la mente enreda'o, en el pecho tengo un dreadlo'
Enamora'o por aqui, enamora'o por alla, Cupido, basta ya
Te quiero pa' mi na' ma', y eso e' egoismo
Me pongo celoso sin razon y eso es machismo, ey
Un bofeton pa' mi mismo
Cogimo' vacacione' y no' fuimo' de turismo
Por el Caribe probando nuevas tactica'
Pero si vuelve' a la Antartica

Yo no soy celoso, pero ¿quien e' ese cabron?
Dime quien e' ese cabron
Tranquila, no soy psycho
No vo'a hacer un papelon, pero
Auch, mi corazon
Yo no soy celoso, pero ¿quien e' ese cabron?
Dime quien e' ese cabron
Tranquila, no soy psycho
No vo'a hacer un papelon, pero
Auch, mi corazon, eh

I've been reading books of old
The legends and the myths
Achilles and his gold
Hercules and his gifts
Spiderman's control
And Batman with his fists
And clearly I don't see myself upon that list

But she said, "Where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can kiss
I want something just like this"

Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo

Oh, I want something just like this
I want something just like this

I've been reading books of old
The legends and the myths
The testaments they told
The moon and its eclipse
And Superman unrolls
A suit before he lifts
But I'm not the kind of person that it fits

She said, "Where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can miss
I want something just like this
I want something just like this"

Oh, I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo

Where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can kiss
I want something just like this

Oh, I want something just like this
Oh, I want something just like this
Oh, I want something just like this

If you're a lover, you should know
The lonely moments just get lonelier
The longer you're in love
Than if you were alone
Memories turn into daydreams
Become a taboo

I don't want to be afraid
The deeper that I go
It takes my breath away
Soft hearts electric souls
Heart to heart and eyes to eyes
Is this taboo?

Baby we built this house
On memories
Take my picture now
Shake it till you see it
And when your fantasies
Become your legacy
Promise me a place
In your house of memories

I think of you from time to time
More than I thought I would
You were just too kind
And I was too young to know
That's all that really matters
I was a fool

Baby we built this house
On memories
Take my picture now
Shake it till you see it
And when your fantasies
Become your legacy
Promise me a place
In your house of memories

Those thoughts of past lovers
They'll always haunt me
I wish I could believe
You'd never wrong me
Then will you remember
Me in the same way
As I remember you

Baby we built this house
On memories
Take my picture now
Shake it till you see it
And when your fantasies
Become your legacy
Promise me a place

Baby we built this house
On memories
Take my picture now
Shake it till you see it
And when your fantasies
Become your legacy
Promise me a place
In your house of memories

In your house of memories
Promise me a place

He querido borrarte pero sueno contigo
Quisiera que entendieras lo que hiciste conmigo
Yo dandote cien y tu me dabas cincuenta
Yo durmiendo contigo y tu con otro te acuestas
Te extrano pero perdonarte que mucho me cuesta
Que mucho me cuesta

Normal si te sientes solita y me extranas
Y se te sale mi nombre
Dificil que llore por mi en otra cama
Dime quien te va creer
La nena no quiere Cartier
Quiere buscarme en otra piel
Vive en la disco todos los fines de semana
Pa' ver si me vuelve a ver

Normal si te sientes solita y me extranas
Y se te sale mi nombre
Dificil que llore por mi en otra cama
Dime quien te va creer
La nena no quiere Cartier
Quiere buscarme en otra piel
Vive en la disco todos los fines de semana
Pa' ver si me vuelve a ver

La nena no quiere un nene sano
A ella le gustan los gatos malo
Y yo en una casita llena de gata' en los cabos
Ese culo se fue y estan lloviendo los chavos

Ahora me estoy perreado una gata mejor
Si le duele el cora, que se tome un Panadol, uy
Partido que juego, partido que meto gol
Y estas otra vez llamando
Diciendo que el alcohol te tiene asi
Pensando en mi, ¿que hijueputas me paso?
¿Que me perdi? bebe, si en las fotos te ves feliz
Ojala y algun dia sientas lo que yo senti
Pa' que veas que es

Normal si te sientes solita y me extranas
Y se te sale mi nombre
Dificil que llore por mi en otra cama
Dime quien te va creer
La nena no quiere Cartier
Quiere buscarme en otra piel
Vive en la disco todos los fines de semana
Pa' ver si me vuelve a ver

Normal si te sientes solita y me extranas
Y se te sale mi nombre
Dificil que llore por mi en otra cama
Dime quien te va creer
La nena no quiere Cartier
Quiere buscarme en otra piel
Vive en la disco todos los fines de semana
Pa' ver si me vuelve a ver
---------------------------------------------------
Te lo adverti, que si fallabas yo te iba a hacer llorar
Tu corazon es de piedra y tus lagrimas de cristal
Pasamos de decir "Te extrano" a ser dos extranos
Se derrumbo en minutos lo que construi en dos anos

Y a veces estaba bien, pero me hacia dano
Tu no eres real, baby, tu eres un engano

Hoy borro tus memorias, tu contacto y to' tus videos
Llego el final de esta historia, no te arrepientas porque ya no te creo
Y hoy borro tus memorias, tu contacto y to' tus videos
Llego el final de esta historia, no te arrepientas porque ya no te creo

Baby, tu eres feka, igual que ese culo
Tienes las tetas real, pero el corazon facturo
De esa vida de mentiras yo era lo unico puro
Quedate con la guagua, con las ganas y con el poodle

A ti yo te di, pero tambien le di delete
A la foto en Paris
Y que me cague en la madre el que me vuelva a parir
Por eso bloquee tu perfil
Yo no queria volver, solo escucharte gemir

Baby, sin mi, tu no luces
Aunque prendan las luces
La culpa la tienes tu, por mas que me acuses
Tantas excusas, que puedes llenar de autobuses
Vas a ver el diablo cuando conmigo te cruces

Hoy borro tus memorias, tu contacto y to' tus videos
Llego el final de esta historia, no te arrepientas porque ya no te creo
Hoy borro tus memorias, tu contacto y to' tus videos
Llego el final de esta historia, no te arrepientas porque ya no te creo

Y a ti yo te leo, aunque tu seas piscis
Cuando no tenia ni carro te buscaba en bici
Pero tu me fallaste y la pusiste easy
Quedate con toas las Louis Vuitton y con las Yeezy

Si quieres, busca a otro cabron que te lleve de compras
No te vo' a dar mi corazon pa' que otra vez lo rompas
Lo menos que tu quieres, tenerme en tu contra
Tu no sirves y lo que no sirve, se bota

Ahora te toca llorar y llorar
Cuando me veas con otra es que te vas a acordar
Me puedes ver, no tocar, sin tocar
Contigo fue que aprendi a nunca perdonar

Y hoy borro tus memorias, tu contacto y to' tus videos
Llego el final de esta historia, no te arrepientas porque ya no te creo
Asi que hoy borro tus me-

(Ya no te creo)

You'll be the saddest part of me
A part of me that will never be mine
It's obvious
Tonight is gonna be the loneliest
You're still the oxygen I breathe
I see your face when I close my eyes
It's torturous
Tonight is gonna be the loneliest

There's a few lines that I have wrote
In case of death, that's what I want, that's what I want
So don't be sad when I'll be gone
There's just one thing I hope you know, I loved you so

'Cause I don't even care about the time I've got left here
The only thing I know now is that I wanna spend it
With you, with you nobody else here
Tonight is gonna be the loneliest

You'll be the saddest part of me
A part of me that will never be mine
It's obvious
Tonight is gonna be the loneliest
You're still the oxygen I breathe
I see your face when I close my eyes
It's torturous
Tonight is gonna be the loneliest

I'm sorry but I gotta go
If you'll ever miss me give this song another go

And I just keep on thinking how you made me feel better
And all the crazy little things that we did together
In the end, in the end, it doesn't matter
If tonight is gonna be the loneliest

You'll be the saddest part of me
A part of me that will never be mine
It's obvious
Tonight is gonna be the loneliest

You're still the oxygen I breathe
I see your face when I close my eyes
It's torturous
Tonight is gonna be the loneliest

You'll be the saddest part of me
A part of me that will never be mine
It's obvious
Tonight is gonna be the loneliest

You'll be the saddest part of me
A part of me that will never be mine
It's obvious
Tonight is gonna be the loneliest
You're still the oxygen I breathe
I see your face when I close my eyes
It's torturous
Tonight is gonna be the loneliest
---------------------------------------------------
It doesn't hurt me
Do you wanna feel how it feels?
Do you wanna know, know that it doesn't hurt me?
Do you wanna hear about the deal that I'm making?
You, it's you and me

And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
Say, if I only could, ooh

You don't wanna hurt me
But see how deep the bullet lies
Unaware I'm tearing you asunder
Ooh, there is thunder in our hearts

Is there so much hate for the ones we love?
Oh, tell me, we both matter, don't we?
You, it's you and me
It's you and me won't be unhappy

And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
Say, if I only could, ooh

You
It's you and me
It's you and me won't be unhappy

Oh, come on, baby. Oh, come on, darling
Let me steal this moment from you now
Oh, come on, angel. Come on, come on, darling
Let's exchange the experience, ooh

And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
I'd be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problems

Say, if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problems

So if I only could
And make a deal with God
I'd get him to swap our places
I'd be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problems

So if I only could
Be running up that hill
With no problems

If I only could, be running up that hill
If I only could, be running up that hill

Once upon a time, not so long ago

Tommy used to work on the docks
Union's been on strike, he's down on his luck
It's tough
So tough
Gina works the diner all day
Working for her man, she brings home her pay
For love
Mm, for love

She says, "We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot"

Whoa, we're halfway there
Whoa-oh, living on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear
Whoa-oh, living on a prayer

Tommy's got his six-string in hock
Now he's holding in, when he used to make it talk
So tough
Ooh, it's tough
Gina dreams of running away
When she cries in the night, Tommy whispers
"Baby, it's okay
Someday"

We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot

Whoa, we're halfway there
Whoa-oh, living on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
Whoa-oh, living on a prayer, living on a prayer

Ooh, we gotta hold on, ready or not
You live for the fight when that's all that you've got

Whoa, we're halfway there
Whoa-oh, living on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Whoa-oh, living on a prayer

Whoa, we're halfway there
Whoa-oh, living on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Whoa-oh, living on a prayer

Whoa, we're halfway there
Whoa-oh, living on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Whoa-oh, living on a prayer

I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang

I was told when I get older all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure and I care what people think

My name's 'Blurryface' and I care what you think
My name's 'Blurryface' and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time, to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out (oh)
Wish we could turn back time (oh), to the good old days (oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out

We're stressed out

Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from
I'd make a candle out of it if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one

It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes homegrown a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and tree-house homes we all would take the latter

My name's 'Blurryface' and I care what you think
My name's 'Blurryface' and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time, to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out (oh)
Wish we could turn back time (oh), to the good old days (oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out

We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face
Saying, "Wake up, you need to make money."
Yeah

We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face
Saying, "Wake up, you need to make money."
Yeah

Wish we could turn back time, to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out (oh)
Wish we could turn back time (oh), to the good old days (oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out

Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face
Saying, "Wake up, you need to make money."
Yeah

No me la hagas usar
Tengo una punto 40
Y una gata pa' perrear
Que con ese culo en lo oscuro te revienta, yea

Guayando con esa mini tu estas abusando
Bellaqueando, estamo' ignorando lo que esta pasando

Baby, tu si estas mas dura que la de ayer
Tirame la senal si te quieres perder
Por ahi comentan que mal me quieren ver
Envidiosos, ¿donde estan? Que no se dejan ver

No me la hagan usar
Yo la quiero usar
No me la hagan usar
Yo la quiero usar

Tengo una punto 40
No me la hagan usar
Tengo una punto 40
No me la hagan usar

Yo de nadie nunca me voy a dejar
Esta noche la vamo' a formar
Somos los favoritos de la gente
Ellos no mienten

No me odien si estoy con ella
Tengo la mas bella
Yo si puedo que los borren si la tocan a ella
Yo mato por ella

Quiero darte en four en la silla, pon la' rodillas
Y olvida, que vo' a martillarte con un reloj sin las manecillas
Tu estas bien pilla, chipete
Le gustan los billetes
Y en un dia fueron cinco veces
Le cure la garganta y no fue con los teses
Ella se lo merece

Porque esta sabrosa, crujiente, como tempura
Se desaparece conmigo, no hay cobertura
Si le doy de la pura
Pura calentura

Oye
Este es el Zorro
Junto con los lobos

There ain't no gold in this river
That I've been washing my hands in forever
I know there is hope in these waters
But I can't bring myself to swim
When I am drowning in this silence
Baby, let me in

Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me

There ain't no room for things to change
When we are both so deeply stuck in our ways
You can't deny how hard I have tried
I changed who I was to put you both first
But now I give up

Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
Had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me

I had good intentions
And the highest hopes
But I know right now
It probably doesn't even show

Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
I didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me

Boy I'm tryna meet your mama
On a Sunday
Then make a lotta love
On a Monday (Ah, ah)
Never need no (No)
No one else, babe
'Cause I'll be

Switchin' the positions for you
Cooking in the kitchen and I'm in the bedroom
I'm in the Olympics way I'm jumping through hoops
Know my love infinite nothing I wouldn't do
That I won't do, switching for you

Perfect, perfect
You're too good to be true (You're too good to be true)
But I get tired of running
Fuck it, now I'm running with you (with you)

Never need no (No)

Cooking in the kitchen and I'm in the bedroom

Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there, and I thought
"Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?"
Ayy

New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh no

Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
"Oh my God, who is she?"
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't say, I didn't warn ya

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far

Ooh, ahh, ahh, ahh
Don't go, don't go to sleep
Don't go, stay up and


Tired of feelin' like I'm trapped in my damn mind
Tired of feelin' like I'm wrapped in a damn lie
Tired of feelin' like my life is a damn game
Nigga really wanna die in the night time

Only time I feel pain, when I'm feelin' love
That's why it's tatted on my face that I'm damn numb
Only tell you 'bout my mind when I'm all alone
That's why I'm never really 'lone in the night time
Change hoes like clothes, I can't get attached
'Cause these hoes fire starters like lit matches
I've been feelin' really lost, duckin' all attachments
I don't really go outside 'cause I hate traffic
I don't wanna go outside, get caught in traffic, traffic


Ooh, ahh, ahh, ahh
Don't go, don't go to sleep
Don't go, stay up and


Tired of feelin' like I'm trapped in my damn mind

Salud, mami

Lo que no sirve, que no estorbe
Te metiste autogol por torpe
Te quedo grande este torque
Ya no estoy pa' que de mi te enamores, baby
Sin visa ni pasaporte
Mande tu falso amor de vacaciones

Pa' la mierda y nunca vuelvas
Que todo se te devuelva, no
De lo que me hiciste, si no te acuerdas

No me vuelvas a llamar
Que hasta bote el celular
De lo toxico que eres se volvio perjudicial
Hoy lo que se va, se va
Conmigo no te equivoques
De lo toxico que eres no te quiero ver mas

Llegue pa'l party, saca la botella
La que te queria, no se quien es ella
Te deje el review, no te puse ni una estrella
Y te olvide porque no dejaste huella

Ya no miro pa' atras ni pa' parquearme
Tengo a uno que esta listo pa' llevarme
El segundo esta esperando en el hotel
Y el tercero lo conozco esta noche

No me llames, que mi numero cambie
Si quieres que te lo de
Llama 1-800-jodete
No se si me escuchaste

No me llames, que mi numero cambie
Si quieres que te lo de
Llama 1-800-jodete

No me vuelvas a llamar
Hasta bote el celular
De lo toxico que eres se volvio perjudicial
Lo que se va, se va
Conmigo no te equivoques
De lo toxico que eres no te quiero ver mas

Ay, yo lo lamento
Tus ganas de volver murieron en el intento
Lo hiciste ver como que perdiste el tiempo
Quedaste bien porque lo mio ni lo cuento

Te veo en las redes, no puedo creerlo
Que pena de ti
Yo, que fui buena y tu que gonorrea
Pagandome asi

Rata de dos patas, lo dijo Paquita
Un animal rastrero
Que se come todo lo que se atraviesa
Diablo, tu ere' un cuero

No digas "Te quiero", mejor se sincero
No digas "Te amo" porque eso fue en vano
Llorando estabas tu y como no te sali
Andas comiendote a otra, pero estas pensando en mi

No me vuelvas a llamar
Que hasta bote el celular
De lo toxico que eres se volvio perjudicial
Lo que se va, se va
Conmigo no te equivoques
De lo toxico que eres no te quiero ver mas

Repitelo, mami
Que a veces no te cambian por algo mejor
Y ni siquiera es algo mas rico

I see you calling
I didn't wanna leave you like that
It's five in the morning, yeah, yeah
A hundred on the dash
'Cause my wheels are rolling
Ain't taking my foot off the gas
And it only took the one night
To see the end of the line
Staring deep in your eyes, eyes

Dancing on the edge, 'bout to take it too far
It's messing with my head, how I mess with your heart
If you wake up in your bed, alone in the dark
I'm sorry, gotta leave before you love me

Ay, ay, leave before you love me
Ay, ay, leave before you love me
Ay, ay, leave before you love me
Ay, ay, leave before you love me

I'm so good at knowing
Of when to leave the party behind
Don't care if they notice, yeah, yeah, no
I'll just catch a ride
I'd rather be lonely, yeah
Than wrapped around your body too tight
Yeah, I'm the type to get naked
Won't give my heart up for breaking
'Cause I'm too gone to be staying, staying

(Dancing on) Dancing on the edge, 'bout to take it too far
It's messing with my head, how I mess with your heart
If you wake up in your bed, alone in the dark
I'm sorry, gotta leave before you love me

Ay, ay, leave before you love me
Ay, ay, leave before you love me
Ay, ay, leave before you love me
Ay, ay, leave before you love me

Dancing on the edge, take it too far
Messing with my head, how I mess with your heart
I'm sorry, alone in the dark
I'm sorry, ay, ay, leave before you love me

Talking away
I don't know what I'm to say
I'll say it anyway
Today is another day to find you
Shying away
I'll be coming for your love. OK?

Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two

So needless to say
Of odds and ends
But I'll be stumbling away
Slowly learning that life is OK.
Say after me,
"It's no better to be safe than sorry."

Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two

Oh, things that you say. Yeah.
Is it life or just to play my worries away?
You're all the things I've got to remember
You're shying away
I'll be coming for you anyway

Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day

Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day

Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)

Loving can hurt
Loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard
You know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
Times forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket
Of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer
'Til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
Wait for me to come home

Loving can heal
Loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know (know)
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of ya
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
Times forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket
Of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer
'Til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone

And if you hurt me
That's OK, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

Oh you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat
Where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul

And if you hurt me
Well, that's OK, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

When I'm away
I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost
Back on 6th street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
"Wait for me to come home"
---------------------------------------------------
The games you played were never fun
You'd say you'd stay but then you'd run

Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need
I don't want any settled scores
I just want you to set me free
Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need, say I need

I'm not afraid anymore
What makes you sure you're all I need? (I need)
Forget about it
When you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're teaching me to live without it
Bored, I'm so bored, I'm so bored, so bored

I'm home alone, you're God knows where
I hope you don't think that shit's fair

Giving you all you want and more
Giving you every piece of me
I don't want love I can't afford
I just want you to love for free
Can't you see that I'm getting bored?
Giving you every piece of me, piece of me

I'm not afraid anymore
What makes you sure you're all I need?
Forget about it
When you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're teaching me to live without it
Bored, I'm so bored, I'm so bored, so bored

Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need
I don't want any settled scores
I just want you to set me free
Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need, say I need

I'm not afraid anymore
What makes you sure you're all I need?
Forget about it
And when you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're teaching me to live without it

Drink from me, drink from me
That I shoot across the sky
Symphony
That I shoot across the sky
We're on a...
Drink from me, drink from me
That I shoot across the sky
Symphony
(So high, so high)
That I shoot across the sky


Oh, angel sent from up above
You know you make my world light up
When I was down, when I was hurt
You came to lift me up
Life is a drink, and love's a drug
Oh, now I think I must be miles up
When I was a river, dried up
You came to rain a flood


You said drink from me, drink from me
When I was so thirsty
Poured on a symphony
Now I just can't get enough
Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Poured on a symphony
When I'm low, low, low, low


I, oh, I, oh, I
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Now I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Woo!


Oh, angel sent from up above
I feel it coursing through my blood
Life is a drink, your love's about
To make the stars come out

Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Poured on a symphony
When I'm low, low, low, low


I, oh, I, oh, I
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh I, oh, I, oh, I
Now I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high


I, oh, I, oh, I
La la la la la la la
So high, so high
I, oh, I, oh, I
I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high

That I shoot across the sky
That I shoot across the...
That I shoot across the sky
Watch me shoot across the..
That I shoot across the sky
That I shoot across the...
That I shoot across the sky
That I shoot across the...
---------------------------------------------------
Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my old life behind
Not a yes-sir, not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder

Thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun-, thunder
Thun-thun-thunder, thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun-, thunder
Thun-thun-thunder, thunder

Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
Thunder, thunder
Thunder

Kids were laughing in my classes
While I was scheming for the masses
Who do you think you are?
Dreaming 'bout being a big star
They say you're basic, they say you're easy
You're always riding in the back seat
Now I'm smiling from the stage while
You were clapping in the nosebleeds

Thunder
Thunder, thun-, thunder
Thun-thun-thunder, thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun-, thunder
Thun-thun-thunder, thunder

Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
Thunder

Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder, thunder

Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder, thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder, thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
(Never give up, never give up)
Lightning then the thunder, thunder
(Never give up on your dreams)
Thunder, feel the thunder
(Never give up, never give up)
Lightning then the thunder, thunder
(Never give up on your dreams)

Thunder, thunder, thun-, thunder
Thun-thun-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun-, thunder
Thun-thun-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun-, thunder
Thun-thun-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun-, thunder
Thun-thun-thunder, thunder

If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time

You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You, moonlight, you're my starlight (You're the moonlight)
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating

I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy
I see us written in the stars
We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never
Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far
Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
Shining just the way we are
I feel like we're forever every time we get together
But whatever, let's get lost on Mars

You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You can fly away with me tonight
You can fly away with me tonight
Baby, let me take you for a ride

And I'm feeling so electric, dance my ass off
And even if I wanted to, I can't stop

'Cause, ah-ah, I'm in the stars tonight
So watch me bring the fire and set the night alight

Shoes on, get up in the morn
Cup of milk, let's rock and roll
King Kong, kick the drum, rolling on like a rolling stone
Sing song when I'm walking home
Jump up to the top, LeBron
Ding dong, call me on my phone
Ice tea and a game of ping pong

This is getting heavy
Can you hear the bass boom? I'm ready
Life is sweet as honey
Yeah, this beat cha ching like money
Disco overload, I'm into that, I'm good to go

Shining through the city with a little funk and soul
So I'ma light it up like dynamite, whoa

Bring a friend, join the crowd
Whoever wanna come along
Word up, talk the talk, just move like we off the wall
Day or night the sky's alight
So we dance to the break of dawn

Ey, hace mucho que no te habia visto
Si dices que no, pues no te insisto
Pero tengo que decirte

Hoy te veo diferente, no se por que
Por fin te tengo de frente, dime que lo que
Ey, ey
Yo ando solito y tu no andas con el
Tranquila, que yo no quiero volver
Yo solo quiero darte
Las gracias por ultima vez

Eh, eh, ey
Baby, lo nuestro fue algo bonito
Yo me acuerdo tu y yo de chamaquitos
Si rompes el hielo, despues yo lo derrito

Tu estas fria como Denver porque extranas a Carmelo
Te pillo contra las cuerdas y te echo un Canelo
Baby, no estas en Charlotte, pero ven, LaMelo
Yo se que estas con el, pero no me dan celos

Ahora veo que ese culo 'ta mas grande que ayer
Todavia tengo tus fotos guarda' en el cel
A veces pienso en lo que pudo ser
Eh-eh-eh

Pa' que te enamores tu tienes al otro, baby
Ahora te vo' a dar como se supone
Esto lo vamo' a revivir
Pa' que te enamores tu tienes al otro, baby
Ahora te vo' a dar como se supone
Esto lo vamo' a revivir

Hoy te veo diferente, no se por que
Por fin te tengo de frente, dime que lo que
Ey, ey
Yo ando solito y tu no andas con el
Tranquila, que yo no quiero volver
Yo solo quiero darte
Las gracias por ultima vez

Yea-yea-yea-yea
Yo quiero agradecerte, thank you
Quiero chingarte, I wanna fuck you
Ey, sin decirte "I love you"
Quiero ver ese culote en point of view

Y tu sabe' que el nene no se persea
Ey, yo te lo pongo donde sea
Mami, se que me deseas
Donde hubo fuego, cenizas quedan

Que tu me olvides no creo que puedas
Te hiciste un update, yo quiero una prueba
Tu siempre fuiste la nena, tu fuiste la beba

Pero hoy te veo diferente, no se por que
Por fin te tengo de frente, dime que lo que

¡Fuego!
Ese culo esta mas grande que ayer, que ayer, que ayer
Yo quiero una prueba, prue-
Ese culo esta mas grande, esta mas grande, esta mas grande
Que ayer, que ayer, que ayer, que ayer
(Pa' que te enamores)
LEGENDADDY
(Como se supone
Esto lo vamo' a revivir)
---------------------------------------------------
I met you in the dark
You lit me up
You made me feel as though
I was enough
We danced the night away
We drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute I was stone-cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told you
I think that you should get some rest

I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you
But I never showed
But I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I'll wake you up with some
Breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee
With a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars
For that night

When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that every day you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling, your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far, my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me
When I needed you most

I'm gonna love you 'til
My lungs give out
I promise 'til death we part
Like in our vows
So I wrote this song for you
Now everybody knows
That it's just you and me
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

Just say you won't let go
Oh, just say you won't let go
---------------------------------------------------
Aun quedan dos botellas de vino, de vino
Por si se juntan nuestro' camino, camino
Y no hay que encontrar el atardecer
Hay mucho de mi que te falto conocer
Si la vida me da de nuevo el placer
Voy a volverte a besar como aquella ve' que el sol se escondio
Mientras la noche llegaba
No se que sucedio pero me perdi en tu mirada

Eh, eh, eh, eh
Oh, oh, mami, dime por que te fuiste
Ey, ey, oh, oh, mami, dime que tu me hiciste
Que pasa el tiempo y no te olvido
Buscame, ya estoy vestido
Hoy si o si yo me quedo en un cuarto que no es mio
Dejame acariciarte hasta quedarno' dormido'
Yo haciendote cosas nueva' y tu improvisando gemido'
Eh, eh, eh, eh
Tu a mi me gusta' mas que el dinero, eh, eh, eh
Quiero que te vengas tu primero
A vece' me pregunto que sera de tu vida
Ojala un dia de estos me escriba'

Hey, you know I'm thinking 'bout you
Please stay, 'cause I've been thinking 'bout you
Vamo' suavecito, me besa' tan bien
Empieza en mi ombligo, termina en mis pies
Beni no te olvido
Yo te digo, no te fallare
No se que te hizo
Pero yo nunca te dejare

Y no hay que encontrar el atardecer
Hay mucho de mi que te falto conocer
Si la vida me da de nuevo el placer
Voy a volverte a besar como aquella ve' que el sol se escondio
Mientras la noche llegaba
No se que sucedio pero me perdi en tu mirada (Mirada)
---------------------------------------------------
Yeah, yeah, uh (woo!)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

That's the way every day goes
Every time we've no control
If the sky is pink and white
If the ground is black and yellow
It's the same way you showed me
Nod my head, don't close my eyes
Halfway on a slow move
It's the same way you showed me
If you could fly, then you'd feel south
Up north's getting cold soon
The way it is, we're on land
Still I'm someone to hold true
Keep you cool when it's still alive
Won't let you down when it's all ruin

Just the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love
Glory from above
Regard, my dear
It's all downhill from here

In the wake of a hurricane
Dark skin of a summer shade
Nosedive into flood lines
Tall tower of milk crates
It's the same way you showed me
Cannonball off the porch side
Older kids trying off the roof
Just the same way you showed me (You showed)
If you could die and come back to life
Up for air from the swimming pool
You'd kneel down to the dry land
Kiss the Earth that birthed you
Gave you tools just to stay alive
And make it out when the sun is ruined

That's the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love
Glory from above
Regard, my dear
It's all downhill from here

Remember life, remember how it was
Climb trees, Michael Jackson, it all ends here
Say what up to Matthew, to Shoob
Say what up to Danny
Say what up to life immortality
Bending up my Nikes
Running out the Melpomene, nicotine
Stealing granny cigs (Take it easy)
Gimme something sweet
Bitch, I might like immortality
This is life, life immortality
---------------------------------------------------
Double D
Big full breasts on my baby
(Yo we going to Florida)
Triple weight
Couldn't weigh the love I've got for the girl
And I just wanna know
Why you ain't been going to work
Boss ain't working you like this
He can't take care of you like this

Now you're lost, lost in the heat of it all
Girl, you know you're lost
Lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India, lost on a train, lost

Got on my buttercream silk shirt and it's Versace
(There he goes, one of God's own prototypes)
Hand me my triple weight
So I can weigh the work I got on your girl
(Too weird to live, too rare to die)
No I don't really wish
I don't wish the titties would show
Nor have I ever, have I ever let you get caught?

Lost, lost in the heat of it all
Girl, you know you're lost
Lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India, lost on a train, lost

She's at a stove (Who)
Can't believe I got her out here cooking dope (Cooking dope)
I promise she'll be whipping meals up for a family of her own some day
Nothing wrong (Nothing wrong)
No, nothing wrong (Ain't nothing wrong) with a lie (Ooh)
Nothing wrong (Nothing wrong)
With another short plane ride (Ain't nothing wrong)
Through the sky (Up in the sky)
You and I (Just you and I)

Lost, lost in the heat of it all
Girl, you know you're lost
Lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India, lost on a train, lost

Love lost, lost? Love, love
Love lost, lost? Love, love
Love lost, love love, love lost
Faith is the substance
Manos arriba!

What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawin' me in and you kickin' me out
You've got my head spinnin', no kiddin'
I can't pin you down
What's goin' on in that beautiful mind?
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me
But I'll be alright

My head's under water, but I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginnin'
Even when I lose, I'm winnin'

'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh

How many times do I have to tell you?
Even when you're crying, you're beautiful too
The world is beating you down, I'm around
Through every mood
You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing
In my head for you

My head's under water, but I'm breathin' fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginnin'
Even when I lose, I'm winnin'

'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh

Give me all of you, oh
Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts
Risking it all, though it's hard

'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginnin'
Even when I lose, I'm winnin'

'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you

I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh

Living easy, lovin' free
Season ticket on a one way ride

Ain't nothing I'd rather do

My friends are gonna be there too, yeah

I'm on the highway to hell

(Highway to hell) Highway to hell
(Highway to hell)

And I'm going down
All the way
I'm on the highway to hell

Ey, ey
El sol salio a janguear con las nube' y me regalaron un dia cabron
Como cuando me quedaba en Boqueron o en Manati
Lo mejor nunca se sube, a menos que en la radio salga esta cancion
Hoy vo'a darle paz a mi corazon, por eso me perdi

Me fui de vacacione' con muchas cerveza' y cancione'
Un shot por las buenas amistade' y por las bendicione'
Y si el dia se pone feo, tu me lo haces bonito
Ya no pido mas deseo', tengo todo lo que necesito

Ey, ey
Mi shorty con la gente que quiere saberlo to'
Si pongo el location, ya no e' un secret spot
Hoy vo'a pasarla bien y no pensar en na'
Y no pensar en na', y no pensar en na'
Porque a veces pienso tanto
Que me olvido de dar gracias cuando me levanto
A veces pienso tanto que me olvido de pensar en mi
Que me olvido hasta de dormir, ey
Asi que no se asusten si desaparezco
Un rato bien lejo', yo me lo merezco
No me hablen del trabajo, no me hablen de escuela
Que yo si voy al ancla y abri las vela'
Puedo ver el paraiso llegando a Isabela
Un mango de Mayague', despue' pa' La Palguera
Puerto Rico se ve lindo hasta en Google Maps
Y hoy le quiero dar la vuelta con Sensei, con Gabs
Lo que traigo es vibra linda, no quiero frontear
Pa' la' babie' yo despues saco un disco de trap
No me busque', que no me va' a encontrar
No me va' a encontrar, no, no

Me fui de vacacione' con muchas cerveza' y cancione'
Un shot por las buenas amistade' y por las bendicione' (Oh)
Y si el dia se pone feo, tu me lo haces bonito
Ya no pido mas deseo', tengo todo lo que necesito

Ey, ya no pido mas deseo', tengo todo lo que necesito

If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time

I see us written in the stars
We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never
Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far
Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
Shining just the way we are
I feel like we're forever every time we get together
But whatever, let's get lost on Mars

Hey
It's not like you've ever tried to stay
Sometimes it seems like I'm in your way
Well, that's how it seems
Hey
You know what I mean?

Seems like I care too much
When I'm all alone, oh no
Feel like I care too much
When no one's at home for me
Feel like I'm falling out
Well, that's how it seems
I think that I'm falling out
You know what I mean?

Seems like I care too much
When I'm all alone, oh no
She said that I care too much
When no one's at home for me, ah
---------------------------------------------------
Hello
I've waited here for you
Everlong
Tonight
I throw myself into
And out of the red
Out of her head she sang

Come down
And waste away with me
Down with me
Slow how
You wanted it to be
I'm over my head
Out of her head she sang

And I wonder
When I sing along with you
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You gotta promise not to stop when I say when she sang

Breathe out
So I can breathe you in
Hold you in
And now
I know you've always been
Out of your head
Out of my head I sang

And I wonder
When I sing along with you
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You gotta promise not to stop when I say when she sang


So, Dad would take the Sundays off.
And that's the only time he could ever get any rest.
And so, because we were loud on Sundays, he'd make us hold his construction boots over our head, 'til we'd sleep.
And they were really heavy boots and I used to say, "Dad, come on, please."
And like start crying, 'cause they're too heavy.

And I wonder
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when
---------------------------------------------------
I'm gonna fight 'em off
A seven nation army couldn't hold me back
They're gonna rip it off
Taking their time right behind my back
And I'm talkin' to myself at night
Because I can't forget
Back and forth through my mind
Behind a cigarette

And the message comin' from my eyes says, "Leave it alone"

Don't wanna hear about it
Every single one's got a story to tell
Everyone knows about it
From the Queen of England to the hounds of hell
And if I catch it comin' back my way
I'm gonna serve it to you
And that ain't what you want to hear
But that's what I'll do

And the feeling coming from my bones says, "Find a home"

I'm going to Wichita
Far from this opera for evermore
I'm gonna work the straw
Make the sweat drip out of every pore
And I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding
Right before the Lord
All the words are gonna bleed from me
And I will think no more

And the stains comin' from my blood tell me, "Go back home"
---------------------------------------------------
Yeah
7:30 in the night, yeah
Ooh-oooh, ooh

I get those goosebumps every time, yeah, you come around, yeah
You ease my mind, you make everything feel fine
Worried 'bout those comments

You ease my mind, you make everything feel fine
Worried 'bout those comments
I'm way too numb, yeah, it's way too dumb, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, I need the Heimlich
Throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah
When you're not around
When you throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time


I want to press my like, yeah, I wanna press my
I want a green light, I wanna be like
I wanna press my line, yeah
I wanna take that ride, yeah
I'm gonna press my line
I want a green light, I wanna be like, I wanna press my
Mama, dear, spare your feelings
I'm relivin' moments, peeling more residual
(I can) buy the building, burn the building
Take your bitch, rebuild the building just to fuck some more
(I can) justify my love for you
And touch the sky for God to stop, debating war
Put the pussy on a pedestal (Ayy)
Put the pussy on a high horse
That pussy to die for
That pussy to die for
Peter, piper, picked a pepper
So I could pick your brain and put your heart together
We depart the shady parts and party hard
The diamonds yours, the coupe forever
My best shots might shoot forever like (Brr)


I get those goosebumps every time, yeah, you come around, yeah
You ease my mind, you make everything feel fine
Worried 'bout those comments
I'm way too numb, yeah, it's way too dumb, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, I need the Heimlich
Throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah
When you're not around
When you throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time
---------------------------------------------------
You leapt from crumbling bridges watching cityscapes turn to dust
Filming helicopters crashing in the ocean from way above

Got the music in you baby
Tell me why
Got the music in you baby
Tell me why
You've been locked in here forever and you just can't say goodbye

Kisses on the foreheads of the lovers wrapped in your arms
Youve been hiding them in hollowed out pianos left in the dark

Got the music in you baby
Tell me why
Got the music in you baby
Tell me why
You've been locked in here forever and you just can't say goodbye

Your lips
My lips
Apocalypse
Your lips
My lips
Apocalypse
Go and sneak us through the rivers flood is rising up on your knees
Oh please
Come out and haunt me
I know you want me
Come out and haunt me

Sharing all your secrets with each other since you were kids
Sleeping soundly with the locket that she gave you clutched in your fist

Got the music in you baby
Tell me why
Got the music in you baby
Tell me why
You've been locked in here forever and you just can't say goodbye
You've been locked in here forever and you just can't say goodbye

Oh
When you're all alone
I will reach for you
When you're feeling low
I will be there too
---------------------------------------------------
Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much and that's an issue
But I'm OK
Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them
Again

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no calls
Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar
And I, I, I, I, I can't stop
No, I, I, I, I, I can't stop

So, baby, pull me closer
In the back seat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of that mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

You look as good as the day I met you
I forget just why I left you,
I was insane
Stay and play that Blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson
OK

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no call
Now I'm looking pretty in a hotel bar
And I, I, I, I, I can't stop
No, I, I, I, I, I can't stop

So, baby, pull me closer
In the back seat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of that mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

So, baby, pull me closer
In the back seat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of that mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
No, we ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
No, we ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
No, we ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
No, we ain't ever getting older

I used to believe
We were burnin' on the edge of somethin' beautiful
Somethin' beautiful
Sellin' a dream
Smoke and mirrors keep us waiting on a miracle
On a miracle

Say, go through the darkest of days
Heaven is a heartbreak away
Never let you go, never let me down
Oh, it's been a hell of a ride
Driving the edge of a knife
Never let you go, never let me down

Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah
I won't give up, nah-nah-nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah
I won't give up, nah-nah-nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
Oh, baby, baby

Don't fall asleep
At the wheel, we've got a million miles ahead of us
Miles ahead of us
All that we need
Is a rude awakening to know we're good enough
Know we're good enough

Say go through the darkest of days
Heaven is a heartbreak away
Never let you go, never let me down
Oh, it's been a hell of a ride
Driving the edge of a knife
Never let you go, never let me down

Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah
I won't give up, nah-nah-nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah

She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky (Sky)
Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stared too long I'd probably break down and cry

Whoa-oh-oh! Sweet child o' mine
Whoa, oh-oh-oh! Sweet love of mine

She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by

Whoa-oh-oh! Sweet child o' mine
Ooh, oh-oh-oh! Sweet love of mine

Oh yeah! Whoa-oh-oh-oh! Sweet child o' mine
Ooh-oh, oh, oh! Sweet love of mine
Whoa, oh-oh-oh! Sweet child o' mine, ooh yeah
Ooh! Sweet love of mine

Where do we go?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go?
Ooh, where do we go?
Where do we go now?
Oh, where do we go now?
Where do we go? (Sweet child)
Ooh, where do we go now?
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Where do we go now? Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, wow
Where do we go?
Oh, where do we go now?
Oh, where do we go?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go?
Ooh, where do we go now?
Now, now, now, now, now, now, now
Sweet child, sweet child o' mine

Ladies up in here tonight
No fighting
We got the refugees up in here
No fighting, no fighting

Shakira, Shakira

I never really knew that she could dance like this
She make a man wanna speak Spanish
¿Como se llama (si), bonita (si), mi casa (si, Shakira Shakira), su casa

Oh baby when you talk like that
You make a woman go mad
So be wise (Si!) and keep on (Si!)
Reading the signs of my body
(Uno, dos, tres, cuatro)

I'm on tonight
You know my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel it's right
All the attraction, the tension
Don't you see baby? this is perfection

Hey girl, I can see your body moving
And it's driving me crazy
And I didn't have the slightest idea
Until I saw you dancing

And when you walk up on the dance floor
Nobody cannot ignore the way you move your body, girl (Just smooth)
And everything's so unexpected  the way you right and left it
So you can keep on shaking it (Let's go)

Shakira, Shakira

Oh boy, I can see your body moving
Half animal, half man
I don't, don't really know what I'm doing
But you seem to have a plan
My will and self-restraint
Have come to fail now, fail now
See, I'm doing what I can, but I can't so you know
That's a bit too hard to explain
(Uno, dos, tres, cuatro)

Baila en la calle de noche (Uh, yeah)
Baila en la calle de dia (Let's go!)

You know you got me hypnotized
So be wise (Si!) and keep on (Si!)
Reading the signs of my body

Senorita, feel the conga, let me see you move like you come from Colombia
Yeah, oh, yeah, ladies, si! (Yeah, yeah, hey, yeah)

Mira en Barranquilla se baila asi, say it!
Mira en Barranquilla se baila asi

Yeah
She's so sexy every man's fantasy a refugee like me back with the Fugees from a third-world country
I go back like when 'pac carried crates for Humpty Humpty
We lead the whole club jazzy
Why the CIA wanna watch us?
Colombians and Haitians
I ain't guilty, it's a musical transaction
Bo-bop-so-bop, no more do we snatch ropes
Refugees run the seas 'cause we own our own boats, boats (No fighting)

I'm on tonight, my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel you boy
Come on let's go, real slow
Baby, like this is perfecto (No fighting)

Oh, you know I'm on tonight and my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel it's right
The attraction, the tension
Baby, like this is perfection

No fighting
No fighting
---------------------------------------------------
Yeah, nigga, we're still fucking with you
Still waters run deep
Still Snoop Dogg and D.R.E
'99, nigga, guess who's back
Still, still doing that shit, huh, Dre?
Oh for sure
Yeah
Check me out

It's still Dre Day nigga, AK nigga
Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
'Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How? Nigga, my last album was The Chronic (Nigga)
They wanna know if he still got it
They say rap's changed, they wanna know how I feel about it
(If you ain't up on things)
Dr. Dre is the name, I'm ahead of my game
Still puffing my leaves, still fuck with the beats
Still not loving police (Huh-uh)
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease (For sure)
Still got love for the streets, repping 213 (For life)
Still the beats bang, still doing my thing
Since I left ain't too much changed, still

I'm representing for them gangsters all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E
I'm representing for them gangsters all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E

Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends
Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dipping again
Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
He's triple platinum, doing 50 a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat rap like Cali weed: I smoke 'til I'm 'sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire 'til you're soaking in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
Since "Turn Out the Lights" from the World Class Wrecking Crew
I'm still at it, after mathematics
In the home of drive-bys and ak-matics
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic
I dip through, then I give you (Still) D.R.E

I'm representing for them gangsters all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E
I'm representing for them gangsters all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E

It ain't nothing but more hot shit
Another classic CD for y'all to vibe with
Whether you're cooling on the corner with your fly bitch (Bitch)
Laid-back in the shack, play this track
I'm representing for the gangsters all across the world
Still (Hitting them corners in them low-lows, girl)
I'll break your neck, damn near put your face in your lap
Niggas try to be the king, but the ace is back
(So if you ain't up on things)
Dr. Dre be the name (What?), still running the game
Still got it wrapped like a mummy
Still ain't tripping, love to see young blacks get money
Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood
Hit my boys off with jobs, no more living hard (Nah, nah)
Barbeques every day, driving fancy cars (Hey, hey)
Still gon' get mine regardless (Still)

I'm representing for them gangsters all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E
I'm representing for them gangsters all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E
I'm representing for them gangsters all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E

Right back up in your motherfucking ass
9-5 plus four pennies, add that shit up
D.R.E. right back up on top of things
Smoke some with your Dogg
No stress, no seeds, no stems, no sticks!
Some of that real sticky-icky-icky
Ooh wee! Put it in the air!
Well, you's a fool, D-R, ha-ha
---------------------------------------------------
And they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
They wishin' on me, yeah

I been movin' calm, don't start no trouble with me
Tryna keep it peaceful is a struggle for me
Don't pull up at 6 AM to cuddle with me
You know how I like it when you lovin' on me
I don't wanna die for them to miss me
Yes, I see the things that they wishin' on me
Hope I got some brothers that outlive me
They gon' tell the story, shit was different with me

God's plan, God's plan
I hold back, sometimes I won't, yuh
I feel good, sometimes I don't, ayy, don't
I finessed down Weston Road, ayy, 'nessed
Might go down a G.O.D., yeah, wait

She say, "Do you love me?" I tell her, "Only partly

Fifty Dub, I even got it tatted on me

And you know me
Turn the O2 into the O3, dog
Without 40, Oli, there'd be no me
'Magine if I never met the broskies

---------------------------------------------------
Someone told me long ago
There's a calm before the storm
I know, it's been coming for some time
When it's over, so they say
It'll rain a sunny day
I know, shining down like water

I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain?
I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain?
Coming down on a sunny day

Yesterday, and days before
Sun is cold and rain is hard
I know, been that way for all my time
'Til forever, on it goes
Through the circle, fast and slow
I know, it can't stop, I wonder

I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain?
I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain?
Coming down on a sunny day

Yeah!

I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain?
I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain?
Coming down on a sunny day

City's breaking down on a camel's back
They just have to go 'cause they don't know wack
So while you fill the streets, it's appealing to see
You won't get out the county 'cause you're damned and free

You got a new horizon. It's ephemeral style
A melancholy town where we never smile
And all I wanna hear is the message beep
My dreams, they've gotta kiss me
'Cause I don't get to sleep, no

Windmill, windmill for the land
Turn forever hand in hand
Take it all in on your stride
It is ticking, falling down

Love forever. Love is free
Let's turn forever, you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?

Laughing gas these hazmats, fast cats
Lining 'em up like ass cracks
Play these ponies at the track
It's my chocolate attack

Shit, I'm steppin' in the heart of this here (Yeah)
Care Bear reppin' it harder this year (Yeah)
Watch me as I gravitate
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

Yo, we gon' ghost town
This Motown
With your sound
You're in the blink
Gon' bite the dust
Can't fight with us
With your sound
You kill the Inc

So don't stop, get it, get it, get it
Until you're cheddar headed
And watch the way I navigate
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

In the middle of a railroad track (Thunder)
I looked 'round
And I knew there was no turning back (Thunder)
My mind raced
And I thought, what could I do? (Thunder)
And I knew
There was no help, no help from you (Thunder)
Sound of the drums
Beating in my heart
The thunder of guns
Tore me apart

You've been  thunderstruck

Went down the highway
Broke the limit, we hit the town
Went through to Texas
Yeah, Texas, and we had some fun
We met some girls
Some dancers who gave a good time
Broke all the rules, played all the fools
Yeah-yeah, they, they, they blew our minds

I was shaking at the knees
Could I come again please?
Yeah, the ladies were too kind

You've been  thunderstruck, thunderstruck
Yeah-yeah-yeah, thunderstruck

---------------------------------------------------
Yeah
Breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things

Yeah
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who would have thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)

My wrist, stop watchin'
My neck is flossy
Make big deposits
My gloss is poppin'

You like my hair?
Gee, thanks! Just bought it

(Yep)

Wearin' a ring but ain't gon' be no "Mrs."
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction

Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, "Which one?" I say, "Nah, I want all of 'em"
Happiness is the same price as "red-bottoms"

My smile is beamin' (yeah)
My skin is gleamin' (is gleamin')

I don't mean to brag
But I be like, "Put it in the bag"
Yeah
When you see them racks
They stacked up like my ass
Yeah

Gimme the loot
Never mind, I got the juice
Nothin' but net when we shoot

Look at my neck
Look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it then that's what I get

---------------------------------------------------
I know you so well, so well
I mean, I can do anything that he can
I've been pretty...


I know you're somewhere, somewhere
I've been trapped in my mind, girl, just holding on
I don't wanna pretend we're something, we're nothing
I've been stuck thinking 'bout her, I can't hold on (I'll be feeling)

I'm in pain, wanna put ten shots in my brain
I've been trippin' 'bout some things, can't change
Suicidal, same time I'm tame
Picture this, in bed, get a phone call
Girl that you fucked with killed herself
That was this summer when nobody helped
And ever since then, man, I hate myself
Wanna fuckin' end it, pessimistic
All wanna see me with no pot to piss in
But niggas been excited 'bout the grave I'm diggin'
Havin' conversations 'bout my haste decisions
Fuckin' sickenin'; at the same time
Memories surface through the grapevine
'Bout my uncle playin' with a slip knot
Post-traumatic stress got me fucked up
Been fucked up since the couple months they had a nigga locked up

I'll be feelin' pain, I'll be feelin' pain just to hold on
And I don't feel the same, I'm so numb
I'll be feelin' pain, I'll be feelin' pain just to hold on
And I don't feel the same, I'm so numb


I know you so well (I know you, girl)
I mean, I can do better than he can
I've been pretty...
I know you so well
---------------------------------------------------
On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
"This could be Heaven or this could be Hell"
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (Any time of year)
You can find it here

Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

So I called up the Captain
"Please bring me my wine."
He said, "We haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine."
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis

Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice
And she said "We are all just prisoners here, of our own device"
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast

Last thing I remember
I was running for the door
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
"Relax," said the night man
"We are programmed to receive
You can check-out any time you like
But you can never leave!"
---------------------------------------------------
You could never know what it's like
Your blood like winter freezes just like ice
And there's a cold lonely light that shines from you
You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use

And did you think this fool could never win?
Well, look at me, I'm a-coming back again
I got a taste of love in a simple way
And if you need to know while I'm still standing you just fade away

Don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did?
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
And I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

I'm still standing. Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm still standing. Yeah, yeah, yeah

Once I never could've hoped to win
You're starting down the road leaving me again
The threats you made were meant to cut me down
And if our love was just a circus you'd be a clown by now

You know I'm still standing better than I ever did
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

I'm still standing. Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm still standing. Yeah, yeah, yeah

Don't you know that I'm still standing better than I ever did?
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
And I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

I'm still standing. Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm still standing. Yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm still standing. Yeah, yeah, yeah
