Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)
I know the feeling haunt you (Haunt)


This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars approach you, all the stars approach you, all the stars approach you
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer


Tell me what you gon' do to me
Confrontation ain't nothing new to me
You can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue
But you can't bring the truth to me
Fuck you and all your expectations
I don't even want your congratulations
I recognize your false confidence
And calculated promises all in your conversation
I hate people that feel entitled
Look at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you
Oh, you important?
You the moral to the story? You endorsing?
Motherfucker, I don't even like you
Corrupt a man's heart with a gift
That's how you find out who you dealing with
A small percentage who I'm building with
I want the credit if I'm losing or I'm winning
On my mama, that's the realest shit

Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)
I know the feeling haunt you (Haunt)


This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars approach you, all the stars approach you, all the stars approach you
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer

Skin covered in ego
Get to talking like ya involved, like a rebound
Got no end game, got no ways out, got to stay down
It's the way that you making me feel
Like nobody ever loved me like you do, you do
You kinda feel like you're tryna get away from me
If you do, I won't move
I ain't just cry for no reason, I ain't just pray for no reason
I give thanks for the days, for the hours
And another way, another life breathing
I did it all 'cause it feel good
I wouldn't do it at all if it feel bad
Better live your life, we're running out of time


Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for? (Ooh)
Or do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)
I know the feeling haunt you (Haunt)


This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars approach you, all the stars approach you, all the stars approach you
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer

I am not the only traveler
Who has not repaid his debt
I've been searching for a trail to follow again
Take me back to the night we met

And then I can tell myself
What the hell I'm supposed to do
And then I can tell myself
Not to ride along with you

I had all and then most of you, some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met
I don't know what I'm supposed to do, haunted by the ghost of you
Oh, take me back to the night we met

When the night was full of terrors
And your eyes were filled with tears
When you had not touched me yet
Oh, take me back to the night we met

I had all and then most of you, some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met
I don't know what I'm supposed to do, haunted by the ghost of you
Take me back to the night we met
---------------------------------------------------
And I'd give up forever to touch you
'Cause I know that you feel me somehow
You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be
And I don't wanna go home right now

And all I can taste is this moment
And all I can breathe is your life
When sooner or later it's over
I just don't wanna miss you tonight

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming
Or the moment of truth in your lies
When everything feels like the movies
Yeah, you bleed just to know you're alive

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am

Every breath you take
And every move you make
Every bond you break
Every step you take
I'll be watching you
Every single day
And every word you say
Every game you play
Every night you stay
I'll be watching you

Oh, can't you see you belong to me?
How my poor heart aches with every step you take

Every move you make
And every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake
I'll be watching you

Since you've gone, I've been lost without a trace
I dream at night, I can only see your face
I look around, but it's you I can't replace
I feel so cold, and I long for your embrace
I keep crying baby, baby, please

Mm, mm, mm, mm
Mm, mm, mm

Oh, can't you see you belong to me?
How my poor heart aches with every step you take

Nobody pray for me
Even a day for me
Waaaaay (yeah, yeah!)

I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a fella with some counterfeits, but now I'm countin' this
Parmesan where my accountant lives; in fact, I'm downin' this
D'USSE with my boo bae tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy yo' ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris
A.M. to the P.M., P.M. to the A.M., funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it, you and I know

Who dat fella thinkin' that he frontin' on Man-Man? (Man-Man)
Get the fuck off my stage, I'm the Sandman (Sandman)
Get the fuck off my dick, that ain't right
I make a play fucking up your whole life
I'm so fuckin' sick and tired of the Photoshop
Show me somethin' natural like afro on Richard Pryor
Show me somethin' natural like ass with some stretch marks
Still will take you down right on your mama's couch in Polo socks
Ayy, this shit way too crazy, ayy, you do not amaze me, ayy
I blew cool from AC, ayy, Obama just paged me, ayy
I don't fabricate it, ayy, most of y'all be fakin', ayy
I stay modest 'bout it, ayy, she elaborate it, ayy
This that Grey Poupon, that Evian, that TED Talk, ayy
Watch my soul speak, you let the meds talk, ayy
If I kill a fellaa, it won't be the alcohol, ayy
I'm the realest dude after all

House so empty, need a centerpiece
Twenty racks, a table cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby
You talking money, need a hearing aid
You talking 'bout me, I don't see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane

Let a nigga brag Pitt
Legend of the fall took the year like a bandit
Bought mama a crib and a brand new wagon
Now she hit the grocery shop looking lavish
Star Trek roof in that Wraith of Khan
Girls get loose when they hear this song
Hundred on the dash get me close to God
We don't pray for love, we just pray for cars

House so empty, need a centerpiece
Twenty racks, a table cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby

I've been reading books of old
The legends and the myths
Achilles and his gold
Hercules and his gifts
Spiderman's control
And Batman with his fists
And clearly I don't see myself upon that list

But she said, "Where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can kiss
I want something just like this"

Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo

Oh, I want something just like this
I want something just like this

I've been reading books of old
The legends and the myths
The testaments they told
The moon and its eclipse
And Superman unrolls
A suit before he lifts
But I'm not the kind of person that it fits

She said, "Where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can miss
I want something just like this
I want something just like this"

Oh, I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo

Where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can kiss
I want something just like this

Oh, I want something just like this
Oh, I want something just like this
Oh, I want something just like this

Ayy, ayy, ayy
I got a condo in Manhattan
Baby girl, what's happenin'?
You and your ass invited
So go on and get to clappin'
So pop it for a player
Pop, pop it for me
Turn around and drop it for a player
Drop, drop it for me
I'll rent a beach house in Miami (-ami)
Wake up with no jammies (Nope)
Lobster tail for dinner
Julio, serve that scampi (Julio!)
You got it if you want it
Got, got it if you want it
Said, you got it if you want it
Take my wallet if you want it now

Jump in the Cadillac, girl, let's put some miles on it
Anything you want, just to put a smile on it
You deserve it, baby, you deserve it all
And I'm gonna give it to you

Gold jewelry shinin' so bright
Strawberry champagne on ice
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Sex by the fire at night
Silk sheets and diamonds all white
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like

I'm talkin' trips to Puerto Rico (Bih)
Say the word and we go (Say it)
You can be my freaka (Brrrt!)
Girl, I'll be your fleeko, Mamacita
I'll never make a promise that I can't keep
I promise that your smile ain't gon' ever leave
Shoppin' sprees in Paris
Everything 24 karats
Take a look in that mirror
Now tell me, who's the fairest?
Is it you? (Is it you?) Is it me? (Is it me?)
Say it's us (Say it's us) and I'll agree, baby

Jump in the Cadillac, girl, let's put some miles on it

---------------------------------------------------
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know

Oh, it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)
Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, "For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"
He looks up, grinning like a devil

It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)
Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, "For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
---------------------------------------------------
Yeah, yeah, uh (woo!)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

That's the way every day goes
Every time we've no control
If the sky is pink and white
If the ground is black and yellow
It's the same way you showed me
Nod my head, don't close my eyes
Halfway on a slow move
It's the same way you showed me
If you could fly, then you'd feel south
Up north's getting cold soon
The way it is, we're on land
Still I'm someone to hold true
Keep you cool when it's still alive
Won't let you down when it's all ruin

Just the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love
Glory from above
Regard, my dear
It's all downhill from here

In the wake of a hurricane
Dark skin of a summer shade
Nosedive into flood lines
Tall tower of milk crates
It's the same way you showed me
Cannonball off the porch side
Older kids trying off the roof
Just the same way you showed me (You showed)
If you could die and come back to life
Up for air from the swimming pool
You'd kneel down to the dry land
Kiss the Earth that birthed you
Gave you tools just to stay alive
And make it out when the sun is ruined

That's the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love
Glory from above
Regard, my dear
It's all downhill from here

Remember life, remember how it was
Climb trees, Michael Jackson, it all ends here
Say what up to Matthew, to Shoob
Say what up to Danny
Say what up to life immortality
Bending up my Nikes
Running out the Melpomene, nicotine
Stealing granny cigs (Take it easy)
Gimme something sweet
Bitch, I might like immortality
This is life, life immortality
---------------------------------------------------
Oh oh oh oh

Oh, her eyes, her eyes
Make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair
Falls perfectly without her trying
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day
Yeah

I know, I know
When I compliment her she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so
Sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, "Do I look okay?"
I say

When I see your face (face, face...)
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing (amazing)
Just the way you are (are)
And when you smile (smile, smile...)
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing (amazing)
Just the way you are (are)
Yeah

Her lips, her lips
I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh, her laugh
She hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day

Oh you know, you know, you know
I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for
Then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay
You know I'll say,

When I see your face (face, face...)
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing (amazing)
Just the way you are (are)
And when you smile (smile, smile...)
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing (amazing)
Just the way you are (are)

The way you are
The way you are
Girl, you're amazing (amazing)
Just the way you are (are)

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing (amazing)
Just the way you are (are)
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are

Yeah
---------------------------------------------------
Found you when your heart was broke
I filled your cup until it overflowed
Took it so far to keep you close (keep you close)
I was afraid to leave you on your own

I said I'd catch you if you fall (fall)
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (all)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feeling so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinking you could live without me
Thinking you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (yeah, I don't know why)
Thinking you could live without me
Live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (I don't know why, yeah, yeah)

Gave love 'bout a hundred tries (hundred tries)
Just running from the demons in your mind
Then I took yours and made 'em mine (mine)
I didn't notice 'cause my love was blind

Said I'd catch you if you fall (fall)
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (all)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feeling so high but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinking you could live without me
Thinking you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (yeah, I don't know why)
Thinking you could live without me
Live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why, yeah

You don't have to say just what you did (what you did)
I already know (I know)
I had to go and find out from them (oh-woah)
So tell me, how's it feel? (oh-woah)

Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feeling so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinking you could live without me
Thinking you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (yeah, I don't know why)
---------------------------------------------------
Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are

I had to find you
Tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart

Tell me your secrets
And ask me your questions
Oh, let's go back to the start

Running in circles
Coming up tails
Heads on a science apart

Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard

Oh, take me back to the start

I was just guessing
At numbers and figures
Pulling the puzzles apart

Questions of science
Science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart

Tell me you love me
Come back and haunt me
Oh, and I rush to the start

Running in circles
Chasing our tails
Coming back as we are

Nobody said it was easy
Oh, it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be so hard

I'm going back to the start

Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh

City's breaking down on a camel's back
They just have to go 'cause they don't know wack
So while you fill the streets, it's appealing to see
You won't get out the county 'cause you're damned and free

You got a new horizon. It's ephemeral style
A melancholy town where we never smile
And all I wanna hear is the message beep
My dreams, they've gotta kiss me
'Cause I don't get to sleep, no

Windmill, windmill for the land
Turn forever hand in hand
Take it all in on your stride
It is ticking, falling down

Love forever. Love is free
Let's turn forever, you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?

Laughing gas these hazmats, fast cats
Lining 'em up like ass cracks
Play these ponies at the track
It's my chocolate attack

Shit, I'm steppin' in the heart of this here (Yeah)
Care Bear reppin' it harder this year (Yeah)
Watch me as I gravitate
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

Yo, we gon' ghost town
This Motown
With your sound
You're in the blink
Gon' bite the dust
Can't fight with us
With your sound
You kill the Inc

So don't stop, get it, get it, get it
Until you're cheddar headed
And watch the way I navigate
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

Sha, sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da-ca; feel good
Sha, sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da-ca; feel good
Sha, sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da-ca; feel good
Sha, sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da-ca; feel good

Windmill, windmill for the land
Turn forever hand in hand
Take it all in on your stride
It is ticking, falling down

Love forever. Love is free
Let's turn forever, you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?

Don't stop, get it, get it
Peep how your captain's in it
(Sha, sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da-ca; feel good)
Steady, watch me navigate, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
(Sha, sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da-ca; feel good)

Don't stop, get it, get it
Peep how your captain's in it
(Sha, sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da-ca; feel good)
Steady, watch me navigate, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

(Sha, sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da-ca; feel good)
Sha, sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da-ca; feel good (Hahaha!)
Sha, sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da-ca; feel good (Hahaha!)
Sha, sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da-ca; feel good (Hahaha!)
Sha, sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da-ca; feel good (Hahahahahaha!)

Going out tonight
Changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Everything she never had she's showing off


Driving too fast
Moon is breaking through her hair
She's heading for something that she won't forget
Having no regrets is all that she really wants


We're only getting older, baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change me and you


Chasing it tonight,
Doubts are running 'round her head
He's waiting, hides behind a cigarette
Heart is beating loud, and she doesn't want it to stop


Moving too fast
Moon is lighting up her skin
She's falling, doesn't even know it yet
Having no regrets is all that she really wants


We're only getting older, baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change me and you


Going out tonight
Changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Reminds her of the missing piece of innocence she lost


We're only getting older, baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change, baby
It will never change, baby
It will never change me and you
---------------------------------------------------
I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listened as the crowd would sing,
"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know St. Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know St. Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
---------------------------------------------------
Thought I found a way
Thought I found a way out (found)
But you never go away (never go away)
So I guess I gotta stay now

Oh, I hope someday I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear

Isn't it lovely? All alone
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home

Walking out of time
Looking for a better place (looking for a better place)
Something's on my mind
Always in my head space

But I know someday I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive outside I can't fight my fear

Isn't it lovely? All alone
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello. Welcome home

Whoa, yeah
Yeah, ah
Whoa, whoa
Hello, welcome home
---------------------------------------------------
The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go (mmmm)
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow (mmmm)
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now (mmmm)
Take my hand, stop, put Van The Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance
And now I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead (mmmm)

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body

Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date (mmmm)
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate (mmmm)
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay (mmmm)
And leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play
And I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead (mmmm)

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body

Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body

Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

---------------------------------------------------
I wanna take you somewhere so you know I care
But it's so cold and I don't know where
I brought you daffodils in a pretty string
But they won't flower like they did last spring
And I wanna kiss you, make you feel alright
I'm just so tired to share my nights
I wanna cry and I wanna love
But all my tears have been used up

On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up, up

And if somebody hurts you, I wanna fight
But my hands been broken one too many times
So I'll use my voice, I'll be so fucking rude
Words, they always win, but I know I'll lose
And I'd sing a song that'd be just ours
But I sang 'em all to another heart
And I wanna cry, I wanna learn to love
But all my tears have been used up

On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up, up

(Oh, need a love, now, my heart is thinking of)
I wanna sing a song that'd be just ours
But I sang 'em all to another heart
And I wanna cry, I wanna fall in love
But all my tears have been used up

On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up, up
---------------------------------------------------
I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in twelve-thirty flight
Her moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation

I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say
"Hurry, boy, it's waiting there for you"

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
Sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti

I seek to cure what's deep inside
Frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

"Hurry, boy, she's waiting there for you"

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had
---------------------------------------------------
I caught a moment
And it caught me
Floating together, under the trees
We were sippin' on moonlight
Drinking champagne
A couple freaks in the purple rain

Some mistakes are worth making
Sometimes the time is worth wasting
Some heartbreaks are worth braving
I know, you know, you know

I just wanna get closer
Closer to your body than somebody else
I just wanna get closer
Closer to your body than nobody else

Four in the morning
She wants to dance
Twirling the nighttime in her hands
We've got candy and kisses
Keeping us high
Until we make it to paradise, sing

Some mistakes are worth making
Sometimes the time is worth wasting
Some heartbreaks are worth braving
I know, you know, you know

I just wanna get closer
Closer to your body than somebody else
I just wanna get closer
Closer to your body than nobody else
I just wanna get closer

The road to nowhere
Foot on the gas
The sun is watching
Having a laugh
So won't you hold me like the sky holds blue
And I'll keep singing this song for you

I just wanna get closer (closer)
Closer to your body than somebody else
I just wanna get closer (closer)
Closer to your body than nobody else
I just wanna get closer
---------------------------------------------------
Now here you go again
You say you want your freedom
Well, who am I to keep you down?
It's only right that you should
Play the way you feel it
But listen carefully to the sound
Of your loneliness

Like a heartbeat... drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost...
And what you had...
And what you lost

Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Say... Women... they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean... you'll know, you'll know

Now here I go again, I see the crystal visions
I keep my visions to myself
It's only me
Who wants to wrap around your dreams and...
Have you any dreams you'd like to sell?
Dreams of loneliness...

Like a heartbeat... drives you mad...
In the stillness of remembering what you had...
And what you lost...
And what you had...
And what you lost

Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Women they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know

Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Say women they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know, you'll know
You will know, you'll know
---------------------------------------------------
First things first
I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh ooh
The way that things have been, oh ooh

Second things second
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh ooh
The master of my sea, oh ooh

I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Third things third
Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh ooh
Your spirit up above, oh ooh

I was choking in the crowd
Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
Till it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...

Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Last things last
By the grace of the fire and the flames
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh ooh
The blood in my veins, oh ooh
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
Till it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...

Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Look at this photograph
Every time I do, it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red?
And what the hell is on Joey's head?
And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneaking out
And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must've done it half a dozen times
I wonder if it's too late
Should I go back and try to graduate?
Life's better now than it was back then
If I was them, I wouldn't let me in

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, God, I, I
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
(Goodbye)

Remember the old arcade?
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hangin' out
They say somebody went and burned it down
We used to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we know
We said someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just the steering wheel
Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She's had a couple of kids since then
I haven't seen her since God knows when

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, God, I, I
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

I miss that town
I miss their faces
You can't erase
You can't replace it
I miss it now
I can't believe it
So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it
If I could, I'd relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Look at this photograph
Every time I do, it makes me laugh
Every time I do, it makes me

Mama, dear, spare your feelings
I'm relivin' moments, peeling more residual

Take your bitch, rebuild the building just to fuck some more

And touch the sky for God to stop, debating war
Put the pussy on a pedestal (Ayy)
Put the pussy on a high horse
That pussy to die for
That pussy to die for
Peter, piper, picked a pepper
So I could pick your brain and put your heart together
We depart the shady parts and party hard
The diamonds yours, the coupe forever
My best shots might shoot forever like (Brr)

Throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah
When you're not around
When you throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time
---------------------------------------------------
It starts with one

One thing I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time


All I know

Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away


It's so unreal

It's so unreal, didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go


Watch you go

I kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when I tried so hard


I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter


One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard


I tried so hard

In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far


Got so far

Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end


In the end

You kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when I tried so hard


I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
---------------------------------------------------
Welcome to your life
There's no turning back
Even while we sleep
We will find you

Acting on your best behaviour
Turn your back on mother nature
Everybody wants to rule the world

It's my own design
It's my own remorse
Help me to decide
Help me make the most

Of freedom and of pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever
Everybody wants to rule the world

There's a room where the light won't find you
Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down
When they do I'll be right behind you

So glad we've almost made it
So sad they had to fade it
Everybody wants to rule the world

I can't stand this indecision
Married with a lack of vision
Everybody wants to rule the world
Say that you'll never never never never need it
One headline why believe it?
Everybody wants to rule the world

All for freedom and for pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever
Everybody wants to rule the world
---------------------------------------------------
I am unwritten, can't read my mind
I'm undefined
I'm just beginning, the pen's in my hand
Ending unplanned

Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words that you could not find

Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions

Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins

The rest is still unwritten

I break tradition, sometimes my tries
Are outside the line
We've been conditioned to not make mistakes
But I can't live that way

Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words that you could not find

Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions

Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins

Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins

The rest is still unwritten

Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words that you could not find

Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions

Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins

Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins

The rest is still unwritten
The rest is still unwritten
The rest is still unwritten
---------------------------------------------------
I just need someone in my life to give it structure
To handle all the selfish ways I'd spend my time without her
You're everything I want, but I can't deal with all your lovers
Saying I'm the one, but it's your actions that speak louder
Giving me love when you are down and need another
I've got to get away and let you go, I've got to get over

But I love you so
I love you so
I love you so
I love you so

I'm gonna pack my things and leave you behind
This feeling's old and I know that I've made up my mind
I hope you feel what I felt when you shattered my soul
'Cause you were cruel and I'm a fool
So please let me go

But I love you so (please let me go)
I love you so (please let me go)
I love you so (please let me go)
I love you so
---------------------------------------------------
Well, this is what it look like right before you fall
Stumblin' around, you've been guessing your direction
Next step, you can't see at all
And I don't have a name, I don't have a name, no
Who am I to blame? Who am I to blame though?
And I cannot be changed, I cannot be changed, no
Trust me, I've tried
I just end up right at the start of the line
Drawin' circles
Mmm
Well, I drink my whiskey, and you sip your wine
We're doing well, sittin', watchin' the world fallin' down, its decline
And I can keep you safe, I can keep you safe, mmm
Do not be afraid, do not be afraid
You're feeling sorry, I'm feeling fine
Don't you put any more stress on yourself, it's one day at a time
It's gettin' pretty late, gettin' pretty late
Damn, and I find
It goes around like the hands that keep countin' the time
Drawin' circles
---------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------
Ooh
Na-na, yeah

I saw you dancing in a crowded room (Uh)
You look so happy when I'm not with you
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eye

I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away

You could've asked me why I broke your heart
You could've told me that you fell apart
But you walked past me like I wasn't there
And just pretended like you didn't care

I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away

Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
Save your tears for another day
Save your tears for another day (So)

I made you think that I would always stay
I said some things that I should never say
Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine
And now you won't love me for a second time

I don't know why I run away, oh, girl
Said, I make you cry when I run away

Girl, take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
I realize that I'm much too late
And you deserve someone better
Save your tears for another day (Oh yeah)
Save your tears for another day (Yeah)

I don't know why I run away
I'll make you cry when I run away

Save your tears for another day
Ooh, girl, I said (Ah)
Save your tears for another day (Ah)

Save your tears for another day (Ah)
Save your tears for another day (Ah)
---------------------------------------------------
Pour this pint over my feelings
That's that dirty love
If you love me and you mean it why'd you cut me off ?
Risk my freedom for a time-piece tryna find the time we lost
It cost a lot to be a boss
I'm tryna pay it all
No point saying I'm sorry
Used to hate when Hooyo called saying she worries
If you got me then I got you the same way that you got me
In God We Trust, still need a glizzy and a dirty glove

If you locked these doors you still couldn't contain me
They froze the time on my niggas
I'm praying that they don't take me
I get so much love I don't mind if you hate me
This spinner older than me it comes from the 80's, that's why...
This revolver be solving all of our problems
Keep it constant for the nonsense, ain't got options
Paramedic helicopters, you gon' need more than a doctor
If they did me dirty then it's gonna cost them
I need a gun this Lamborghini, my family really needs me
This lean made this rapping easy for me
I can't wait till the day is over
My niggas are never sober
They'll pull you and do you over for free

Stay with me
You tried to love me and leave me
But some how you kept the pain with me
Rolls Royce umbrellas if it rains on me
Don't change, won't change, stay the same with me
Stay the same

All these trials and tribulations gave me game
That's why I'll always choose this money over fame
Everything I overcame...
You think I'd lose it all just for a lame?
Catch a charge, to go to jail and start again?
That's no way
I got charges I'm praying that they all go away
All my niggas done the dash soon as the law came
Remember making a rack and splitting it 4 ways
Stacked that paper persevered and now we all paid
You don't make it where I'm from, I know they mad I made it
Every time I spit it's no cap like we graduated
Ain't got 300 niggas but we all Gladiators
And all the beef is coming marinated
The block's full of fakes, snakes, hoes
It's so contaminated
Only time these niggas squeezing is when they're masturbating
Fuck your allegations
Shoes made out of alligators
You can't sign me, I'm too activated
I guess you don't know what you have until it's gone
I was broke and I was weak but now I'm strong
Hoyoo on the phone, telling me come home
But I'm on this paper route and I know where I'm going

Stay with me
You tried to love me and leave me
But some how you kept the pain with me
Rolls Royce umbrellas if it rains on me
Don't change, won't change, stay the same with me
Stay the same

You told me get my mind right like I haven't done before
I'm a Muslim but still grindin' for some Christian Dior
I'm just tryna die rich cause I'm tired of living poor
You can take my life but you can never take my soul
The streets are unforgettable
I couldn't do this shit alone
Mmm, gunshot
Our Hoyoos really think we haven't hurt nobody
Gotta keep a glizz don't wanna hurt nobody
My niggas with the shits, they're gonna murk somebody
I know my Lord forgives and I'm so so sorry
---------------------------------------------------
Yeah, I know you see the drip and you like it
Wanna text me, but your pride tryna fight it
I know you young, chasin' love, tryna find it
Then I saw you at a party, started wildin'

I want you, so do you want me?
If I said I love you, would you love me?
I could never dub you, but could you dub me?
I don't wanna fall in love, I don't think it's for me
Hope you know I want you, so do you want me?
If I said I love you, would you love me?
I could never dub you, but could you dub me?
I don't wanna fall in love, I don't think it's for me

I ain't no regular nigga
When we pull up to the party, man, the party get bigger
And she fuckin' with Lil Tecca 'cause she know I'm a winner
I pray to God every day, but I know I'm a sinner
More money, more problems, and the bitches get thicker
Deep throat, shootin' like a free throw
Shawty, she a freak ho, that's my line
Yeah, I want a shawty right now, I know you might now
But I ain't tryna waste no time
She know I'm too wavy
Yeah, I'm that nigga, you cannot replace me
As soon as I met you, you said you wan' date me
I can't say I'm loyal, for you? Baby, maybe
These niggas they hate me 'cause they mad they ain't me
So much hoes around me, I'm getting so lazy
I fuck with you, baby, as long as you make me
Sooner or later, I'll make you my baby
Sooner or later, I'll make you my baby

Yeah, I know you see the drip and you like it
Wanna text me, but your pride tryna fight it
I know you young, chasin' love, tryna find it
Then I saw you at a party, started wildin'

Hope you know I want you, so do you want me?
If I said I love you, would you love me?
I could never dub you, but could you dub me?
I don't wanna fall in love, I don't think it's for me
Hope you know I want you, so do you want me?
If I said I love you, would you love me?
I could never dub you, but could you dub me?
I don't wanna fall in love, I don't think it's for me

I don't think it's for me
I don't think it's for me
I don't think it's for me
I don't think it's for me
---------------------------------------------------
Yeah
I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey, what daddy always tell you?
Straighten up little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you crying about?
You got me.

Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there?
Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more crying, wipe them tears
Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Lainie Uncle's crazy, ain't he?
Yeah, but he loves you girl and you better know it
We're all we got in this world
When it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls
Two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze
I know it's confusing you
Daddy's always on the move, mamma's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growing up as daddy, that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us
I don't see us ever being together ever again
Like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then of course everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream

Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise mama's gon' be alright

(Ha)
It's funny
I remember back one year when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up
And stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em were from me
'Cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying
'Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
And at the time every house that we lived in
Either kept getting broken into and robbed
Or shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar
Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurts so bad it broke your momma's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back
On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD and met Dr. Dre
And flew you and momma out to see me
But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
Then you started seeing daddy on the T.V. and momma didn't like it
And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sitting in this empty house, just reminiscing
Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, I guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
Lainie I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah
It's got a ring to it don't it?
Shh, mama's only gone for the moment

Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise mama's gon' be alright

And if you ask me to
Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'mma give you the world
I'mma buy a diamond ring for you
I'mma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'mma break that birdie's neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat don't fuck with dad (ha ha)
---------------------------------------------------
Baby, I like your style

Grips on your waist
Front way, back way
You know that I don't play
Streets not safe
But I never run away
Even when I'm away
Oti, oti, there's never much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray, I pray

That's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me

Baby, I like your style

Strength and guidance
All that I'm wishing for my friends
Nobody makes it from my ends
I had to bust up the silence
You know you gotta stick by me
Soon as you see the text, reply me
I don't wanna spend time fighting
We've got no time

And that's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me

Got a pretty girl and she love me long time
Wine it, wine it, very long time
Oh yeah, very long time
Back up, back up, back up and wine it
Back up, back up and wine it, girl
Back up, back up, back up and wine it
Oh yeah, very long time
Back up, back up and wine it, girl

Tell me, I need to know, where do you wanna go?
'Cause if you're down, I'll take it slow
Make you lose control
Where, where, where
Where, where, where, where
Oh yeah, very long time
Where, where, where
Back up, back up and wine it, girl
Where, where, where, where
'Cause if you're down
Back up, back up and
'Cause if you're down
Back up, back up and
'Cause if you're down
Back up, back up and

I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me

Ladies up in here tonight

She make a man wanna speak Spanish
Como se llama (si), bonita (si), mi casa (si, Shakira Shakira), su casa

So be wise (Si!) and keep on (Si!)
Reading the signs of my body

You know my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel it's right
All the attraction, the tension
Don't you see baby? this is perfection

Hey girl, I can see your body moving
And it's driving me crazy
And I didn't have the slightest idea
Until I saw you dancing

And when you walk up on the dance floor
Nobody cannot ignore the way you move your body, girl (Just smooth)
And everything's so unexpected  the way you right and left it
So you can keep on shaking it (Let's go)

Shakira, Shakira

Oh boy, I can see your body moving
Half animal, half man
I don't, don't really know what I'm doing
But you seem to have a plan
My will and self-restraint
Have come to fail now, fail now
See, I'm doing what I can, but I can't so you know
That's a bit too hard to explain
(Uno, dos, tres, cuatro)

Baila en la calle de noche (Uh, yeah)

She's so sexy every man's fantasy a refugee like me back with the Fugees from a third-world country

We lead the whole club jazzy
Why the CIA wanna watch us?
Colombians and Haitians

Bo-bop-so-bop, no more do we snatch ropes
Refugees run the seas 'cause we own our own boats, boats (No fighting)

---------------------------------------------------
Talking away
Oh, I don't know what I'm to say
I'll say it anyway
Today's another day to find you
Shying away
I'll be coming for your love, OK?

Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two (take on me)

So needless to say
I'm odds and ends
But I'll be stumbling away
Slowly learning that life is OK
Say after me
"It's no better to be safe than sorry"

Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two
In a day or two (take on me)

Things that you say, oh
Is it life or just to play my worries away?
You're all the things I can't remember
You're shying away
I'll be coming for you anyway

Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two
Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two
---------------------------------------------------
May I have your attention please?
May I have your attention please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here

Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam and Tommy just burst in the door
And started whooping her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwing her over furniture (Ah!)
It's the return of the... "Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"
And Dr. Dre said... nothing, you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement! (Ha-ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem

"Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walking around grabbing his you-know-what
Flipping the you-know-who." "Yeah, but he's so cute though!"
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse, than what's going on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes, I wanna get on TV and just let loose, but can't
But it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
"My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips"
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course they gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
"We ain't nothing but mammals.." Well, some of us cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope

But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
"But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?"
Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can, sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Yo Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch, put me on blast on MTV
"Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee!"
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me
So I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me; who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me
It just might be the next best thing but not quite me!

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

I'm like a head trip to listen to, cause I'm only giving you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your living room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it
In front of y'all and I don't gotta be false or sugarcoated at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it
I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums
It's funny; 'cause at the rate I'm going when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurses asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spitting on your onion rings

Or in the parking lot, circling
Screaming "I don't give a fuck!"
With his windows down and his system up
So, will the real Shady please stand up?
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Ha ha
Guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us
Fuck it, let's all stand up
---------------------------------------------------

Bad as you are, you stick around and I just don't know why

If I was your man (baby you)
Never worry bout (what I do)

Every night, doin' you right
You're the type of woman (deserves good thangs)
Fistful of diamonds (hand full of rings)

Baby good love and protection
Make me your selection
Show you the way love's supposed to be
Baby, you should let me love you, love you, love you

Listen
Your true beauty's description looks so good that it hurts
You're a dime plus ninety-nine and it's a shame
Don't even know what you're worth
Everywhere you go they stop and stare
Cause you're bad and it shows
From your head to your toes, Out of control, baby you know

If I was your man (baby you)
Never worry bout (what I do)
I'd be coming home (back to you)
Every night doin' you right
You're the type of woman (deserves good thangs)

---------------------------------------------------
Love's gonna get you killed
But pride's gonna be the death of you and you and me
And you and you and you and me
And you and you and you and me
And you and you and you and me and-


Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
(In another life, I surely was there)
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
(I care, I care)


Hell-raising, wheel-chasing, new worldly possessions
Flesh-making, spirit-breaking, which one would you lessen?
The better part, the human heart
You love 'em or dissect 'em
Happiness or flashiness? How do you serve the question?
See, in a perfect world, I would be perfect, world
I don't trust people enough beyond their surface, world
I don't love people enough to put my faith in man
I put my faith in these lyrics, hoping I make a band
I understand I ain't perfect
I probably won't come around
This time, I might put you down
Last time, I ain't give a fuck, I still feel the same now
My feelings might go numb, you're dealing with cold thumb
I'm willing to give up a leg and arm to show empathy from
Pity parties and functions of you and yours
A perfect world, you probably live another 24
I can't fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure
I can't fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure


Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
In another life, I surely was there
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
(I care, I care)


Maybe I wasn't there (We saw you first)
Maybe I wasn't there (I saw you first)
Maybe I wasn't there (I saw you first)
Maybe I wasn't there


Now, in a perfect world, I probably won't be insensitive
Cold as December, but never remember what winter did
I wouldn't blame you for mistakes I made or the bed I laid
Seems like I point the finger just to make a point nowadays
Smiles and cold stares, the temperature goes there
Indigenous disposition, feel like we belong here
I know the walls, they can listen, I wish they could talk back
The hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that
Sick venom in men and women overcome with pride
A perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies
Promises are broken and more resentment come alive
Race barriers make inferior of you and I
See, in a perfect world, I'll choose faith over riches
I'll choose work over bitches, I'll make schools out of prison
I'll take all the religions and put 'em all in one service
Just to tell 'em we ain't shit, but He's been perfect, world


Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
(In another life, I surely was there)
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
(I care, I care)


Maybe I wasn't there (We saw you first)
Maybe I wasn't there (I saw you first)
Maybe I wasn't there (I saw you first)
Maybe I wasn't there
---------------------------------------------------
I'm going under, and I fear this time there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

And now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

I'm going under, and I fear this time there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to hear
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

And now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

And now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
---------------------------------------------------
Cinnamon in my teeth
From your kiss, you're touching me
All the pills that you take
Violet, blue, green, red to keep me at arm's length don't work
You try to push me out, but I just find my way back in
Violet, blue, green, red to keep me out, I win

There's things I wanna say to you, but I'll just let you live
Like if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
There's things I wanna talk about, but better not to give
But if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hold me, love me, touch me, honey
Be the first who ever did
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hold me, love me, touch me, honey
Be the first who ever did

Kerosene in my hands
You make me mad, on fire again
All the pills that you take
Violet, blue, green, red to keep me at arm's length don't work

There's things I wanna say to you, but I'll just let you live
Like if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
There's things I wanna talk about, but better not to give
But if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hold me, love me, touch me, honey
Be the first who ever did
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hold me, love me, touch me, honey
Be the first who ever did

There's things I wanna say to you, but I'll just let you live
Like if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
There's things I wanna talk about, but better not to give
Like if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
---------------------------------------------------
Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain
I leave my heart open but it stays right here empty for days
She told me in the morning she don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die these words will be written on my stone

And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The ground beneath my feet is open wide
The way that I been holding on too tight
With nothing in between

The story of my life
I take her home
I drive all night
To keep her warm
And time is frozen (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life
I give her hope
I spend her love
Until she's broke
Inside
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)

Written on these walls are the colors that I can't change
Leave my heart open but it stays right here in its cage
I know that in the morning now I'll see us in the light upon a hill
Although I am broken, my heart is untamed, still

And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The fire beneath my feet is burning bright
The way that I've been holding on so tight
With nothing in between

The story of my life
I take her home
I drive all night
To keep her warm
And time is frozen (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life
I give her hope
I spend her love
Until she's broke
Inside
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)

And I been waiting for this time to come around
But baby running after you is like chasing the clouds

The story of my life
I take her home
I drive all night
To keep her warm
And time is frozen
The story of my life
I give her hope (give her hope)
I spend her love
Until she's broke (until she's broke inside)
Inside
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)

The story of my life
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life

Pensaba que te habia olvidado
Pero pusieron la cancion
Que cantamos bien borrachos
Que bailamos bien borrachos
Nos besamos bien borrachos los dos

Pensaba que te habia olvidado
Pero pusieron la cancion
Que cantamos bien borrachos
Que bailamos bien borrachos
Nos besamos bien borrachos los dos

Pensaba que te habia olvidado

Justo cuando creia que por comerme a dos o diez
Te olvidaria, cogi un respiro y me sali de la via
Y como un pendejo no sabia lo que hacia
Nunca lo supere, nunca te supere
Hasta me aprendi to'as las baladas en Ingles
Respire y conte hasta tres eres la fantasia oscura de Kanye West

Bebe hey
Hace tiempo lo barato me salio caro
Ya solo Twiteo o a la loca disparo
Como olvidar lo bella que era en el carro?
La que aqui yo solo

Pensaba que te habia olvidado
Pero pusieron la cancion
Que cantamos bien borrachos
Que bailamos bien borrachos
Nos besamos bien borrachos los dos

Pensaba que te habia olvidado
Pero pusieron la cancion
Que cantamos bien borrachos
Que bailamos bien borrachos
Nos besamos bien borrachos los dos

Y hace tiempo
Que no venias a mi cabeza
Pero ya van par de cervezas
Y me acorde de como tu me besas
De todos los polvos encima de la mesa
En el carro, en la playa y el motel
En casa de tu pa' y cuando yo te iba a ver
Las veces que tu Mai nos llego a coger
Tu brincando moja'ita sudando Chanel
Yo se que lo nuestro es cosa de ayer
Y me pone contento que te va bien con el
Yo ni te extranaba ni te queria ver
Pero pusieron la cancion que te gustaba poner
Y me acorde ti, cuando me hiciste feliz
Se acabo pues me fui, yo mismo me rio de mi, porque

Pensaba que te habia olvidado
Pero pusieron la cancion
Que cantamos bien borrachos
Que bailamos bien borrachos
Nos besamos bien borrachos los dos

Y yo pensaba que tu nombre estaba muerto
Pero te sone despierto
Ey, hoy sali pa' la calle suelto
Sin sentimiento el corazon desierto

Y yo pensaba que tu nombre estaba muerto
Pero te sone despierto
Hoy sali pa' la calle suelto
Sin sentimiento el corazon desierto
---------------------------------------------------
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

Your man on the road, he doin' promo
You said, "Keep our business on the low-low"
I'm just tryna get you out the friend zone
'Cause you look even better than the photos
I can't find your house, send me the info
Driving through the gated residential
Found out I was coming, sent your friends home
Keep on tryna hide it, but your friends know

I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

I'ma let you know and keep it simple
Tryna keep it up don't seem so simple
I just fucked two bitches 'fore I saw you
And you gon' have to do it at my tempo
Always tryna send me off to rehab
Drugs started feeling like it's decaf
I'm just tryna live life for the moment
And all these motherfuckers want a relapse

I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

Hills have eyes, the hills have eyes
Who are you to judge? Who are you to judge?
Hide your lies, girl, hide your lies (Hide your lies, oh, baby)
Only you to trust, only you

I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

What about love? What about love?
---------------------------------------------------
You've been my muse for a long time
You get me through every dark night
I'm always gone, out on the go
I'm on the run and you're home alone
I'm too consumed with my own life

Are we too young for this?
Feels like I can't move

Sharing my heart
It's tearing me apart
But I know I'd miss you, baby, if I left right now
Doing what I can, tryna be a man
And every time I kiss you, baby
I can hear the sound of breaking down

I've been confused as of late (Yeah)
Watching my youth slip away (Yeah)
You're like the sun, you wake me up
But you drain me out if I get too much
I might need you or I'll break

Are we too young for this?
Feels like I can't move

Sharing my heart
It's tearing me apart
But I know I'd miss you, baby, if I left right now
Doing what I can, tryna be a man
And every time I kiss you, baby
I can hear the sound of breaking down

Breaking down, breaking down, breaking down
Breaking down, breaking down, breaking down

I don't want to play this part
But I do all for you
I don't want to make this hard
But I will 'cause I'm still

Sharing my heart
It's tearing me apart
But I know I'd miss you, baby, if I left right now (I know I would)
Doing what I can, tryna be a man (Be your man)
And every time I kiss you, baby
I can hear the sound of breaking down

Sharing my bed, uh
Sharing my bread, yeah
Sharing my bread
Sharing my head
(I'm breaking down)
Sharing my heart
Sharing my, suddenly I'm
(Breaking down)
Sharing, I'm done
Sharing my life
---------------------------------------------------
I wanna follow where she goes
I think about her and she knows it
I wanna let her take control
'Cause every time that she gets close, yeah

She pulls me in enough to keep me guessing, mmm
And maybe I should stop and start confessing
Confessing, yeah

Oh, I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back

You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back

There's nothing holdin' me back
There's nothing holdin' me back

She says that she's never afraid
Just picture everybody naked
She really doesn't like to wait
Not really into hesitation

Pulls me in enough to keep me guessing, whoa
And maybe I should stop and start confessing
Confessing, yeah

Oh, I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back

You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back

There's nothing holdin' me back

'Cause if we lost our minds
And we took it way too far
I know we'd be alright,
Know we would be alright

If you were by my side
And we stumbled in the dark
I know we'd be alright,
I know we would be alright

'Cause if we lost our minds
And we took it way too far
I know we'd be alright,
I know we would be alright

If you were by my side
And we stumbled in the dark
I know we'd be alright,
We would be alright

Oh, I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back

You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back

There's nothing holdin' me back

I feel so free
When you're with me,
Baby

Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back
---------------------------------------------------
Ay, ay, ay
Good to see you, come on in, let's go
Yeah, let's go
Ha-ha-ha-ha
Alright, alright
OK, uh, alright, OK
Alright, OK

Return of the Mack, get up!
What it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn't
Looking for a better way to get up out of bed
Instead of getting on the Internet and checking on who hit me

Get up! Thrift shop, pimp-strut walking, little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby. Sweater game, nope, nope y'all can't copy

Yup. Bad, moon-walking, this here is our party, my posse's been on Broadway
And we did it our way
Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones into everything I record to it
And yet I'm on

Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and Plinko in my style

Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town

Trust me. On my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit, hustling
Chasing dreams since I was fourteen with the four-track bussing
Halfway cross that city with the backpack, fat cat, crush shit

Labels out here
Nah, they can't tell me nothing (Hey, hey, hey)
We give that to the people
Spread it across the country (Hey, hey, hey)
Labels out here
Nah, they can't tell me nothing (Hey, hey, hey)
We give it to the people
Spread it across the country (Hey, hey, hey)

Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Nah, can I kick it? Thank you. Yeah I'm so damn grateful
I grew up, really wanted gold fronts
But that's what you get when Wu-Tang raised you

Y'all can't stop me, go hard like I got a 808 in my heart beat
And I'm eating at the beat like you give a little speed to a great white shark on Shark Week

Raw. Time to go off. I'm gone
Deuces goodbye. I got a world to see, and my girl she wanna see Rome
Caesar'll make you a believer

Nah I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes from giving it back to the people
Nah sing this song and it goes like

"Raise those hands, this is our party
We came here to live life like nobody was watching"
I got my city right behind me
If I fall, they got me
Learn from that failure gain humility and then we keep marching. I said

Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

And so we put our hands up
And so we put our hands up

Wa oh oh oh wa oh oh oh wa oh oh
Let's go!

Na na na na na na na na (aha)
Hey
And all my people say

Na na na na na na na na (that's right, feels good)
Hey
And all my people say

Na na na na na na na na (it's alright)
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
And all my people say

Na na na na na na na na
Mack-le-le-le-le-le-more


Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
---------------------------------------------------
Can't stop, addicted to the shindig
Chop Top, he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation

Defunct, the pistol that you pay for
This punk, the feelin' that you stay for
In time I want to be your best friend
East side love is living on the West End

Knocked out, but, boy, you better come to (Oh, oh-oh)
Don't die, you know, the truth as some do (Oh-oh)
Go write your message on the pavement (Oh-oh)
Burn so bright, I wonder what the wave meant

White heat is screamin' in the jungle (Oh, oh-oh)
Complete the motion if you stumble (Oh-oh)
Go ask the dust for any answers (Oh-oh)
Come back strong with fifty belly dancers

The world I love, the tears I drop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you?
The world I love, the trains I hop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to

Sweetheart is bleeding in the snow cone
So smart, she's leadin' me to ozone
Music, the great communicator
Use two sticks to make it in the nature

I'll get you into penetration
The gender of a generation
The birth of every other nation
Worth your weight, the gold of meditation

This chapter's gonna be a close one (Oh, oh-oh)
Smoke rings, I know you're gonna blow one (Oh-oh)
All on a spaceship, persevering (Oh-oh)
Use my hands for everything but steering

Can't stop the spirits when they need you (Oh, oh-oh)
Mop tops are happy when they feed you (Oh-oh)
J. Butterfly is in the treetop (Oh-oh)
Birds that blow the meaning into bebop

The world I love, the tears I drop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you?
The world I love, the trains I hop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to

Wait a minute, I'm passin' out
Win or lose, just like you
Far more shockin'
Than anything I ever knew
How 'bout you?
Ten more reasons why I need
Somebody new, just like you
Far more shockin'
Than anything I ever knew
Right on cue

Can't stop, addicted to the shindig
Chop Top, he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation

Defunct, the pistol that you pay for (Oh, oh-oh)
This punk, the feelin' that you stay for (Oh-oh)
In time I want to be your best friend (Oh-oh)
East side love is living on the West End

Knocked out, but boy, you better come to (Oh, oh-oh)
Don't die, you know, the truth is some do (Oh-oh)
Go write your message on the pavement (Oh-oh)
Burn so bright, I wonder what the wave meant

Kick start the golden generator
Sweet talk but don't intimidate her
Can't stop the gods from engineering
Feel no need for any interfering

Your image in the dictionary
This life is more than ordinary
Can I get two, maybe even three of these?
Comin' from the space to teach you of the Pleiades

Can't stop the spirits when they need you
This life is more than just a read-through
---------------------------------------------------
Peace up, A-Town down
Yeah, yeah! Okay, okay!
Usher (Usher, Usher, Usher, Usher)
Lil Jon
Let's go!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Let's go!

I was up in the club with my homies
Tryna get a lil' V-I
Keep it down on the low-key (Low-key)
'Cause you know how it feels (Hey!)
I seen shorty, she was checkin' up on me
From the game she was spitting in my ear
You would think that she know me (Know me)
I decided to chill (Okay!)
Conversation got heavy (Hey!)
She had me feeling like she's ready to blow (Watch out!)
Oh! (Watch out)
She's saying, "Come get me" (Come get me)
So I got up and followed her to the floor
She said, "Baby, let's go"
When I told her (Let's go!), I said

(Yeah!) Yeah!
Shawty got down low, she said, "come and get me"
(Yeah!) Yeah!
I got so caught up, I forgot she told me
(Yeah!) Yeah!
Her and my girl, they used to be the best of homies
(Yeah!) Yeah!
Next thing I knew, she was all up on me, screaming
Yeah (Yeah!) yeah (Yeah!) yeah, yeah!
Yeah (Yeah!) yeah (Yeah!) yeah, yeah!

So she's all up in my head now, got me thinking
That it might be a good idea to take her with me
'Cause she's ready to leave (Ready to leave now) (Let's go!)
And I got to keep it real now
'Cause on a one to ten, she's a certified twenty
But that just ain't me (Hey!)
'Cause I don't know, if I take that chance
Just where's it gonna lead?
But what I do know is the way she dance
Make shorty alright with me
The way she get low
I'm like, yeah, just work that out for me
She asks for one more dance, and I'm like, yeah
How the hell am I supposed to leave?
(Let's go, bring the beat back!) And I say

(Yeah!) Yeah!
Shawty got down low, she said, "come and get me"
(Yeah!) Yeah!
I got so caught up, I forgot she told me
(Yeah!) Yeah!
Her and my girl, they used to be the best of homies
(Yeah!) Yeah!
Next thing I knew, she was all up on me, screaming
Yeah (Yeah!) yeah (Yeah!) yeah, yeah!
Yeah (Yeah!) yeah (Yeah!) yeah, yeah!
(Hey! Hey! Luda!)


Watch out, my outfit's ridiculous
In the club, looking so conspicuous
And these women all on the prowl
If you hold the head steady, I'ma milk the cow (Yeah!)
And forget about game, I'ma spit the truth (What?)
I won't stop 'til I get 'em in their birthday suit (Yeah!)
So gimme the rhythm and it'll be off with their clothes
Then bend over to the front, and touch your toes
I left the Jag and I took the Rolls
If they ain't cutting, then I put 'em on foot patrol (Let's go!)
How you like me now?
When my pinky's valued over three hundred thousand
Let's drink, you the one to please (Yeah!)
Ludacris fill cups like double Ds (Yeah!)
Me and Ursh' once more, and we leaves 'em dead
We want a lady in the street, but a freak in the bed, that say

(Yeah!) Yeah!
Shawty got down low, she said, "come and get me"
(Yeah!) Yeah!
I got so caught up, I forgot she told me
(Yeah!) Yeah!
Her and my girl, they used to be the best of homies
(Yeah!) Yeah!
Next thing I knew, she was all up on me, screaming
Yeah (Yeah!) yeah (Yeah!) yeah, yeah!
Yeah (Yeah!) yeah (Yeah!) yeah, yeah!


Take that and rewind it back
Lil Jon got the beat that make your booty go (Clap)
Take that, rewind it back
Ursher got the voice make your booty go (Clap)
Take that, rewind it back
Ludacris got the flow to make your booty go (Clap)
Take that, rewind it back
Lil Jon got the beat that make your booty go (Clap)
---------------------------------------------------
When you try your best, but you don't succeed
When you get what you want, but not what you need
When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse
And the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone, but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

And high up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try you'll never know
Just what you're worth

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

Tears stream down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Tears stream down your face and I
Tears stream down your face
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
Tears stream down your face and I

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you
---------------------------------------------------
Don't you know I'm no good for you?
I've learned to lose you can't afford to
Tore my shirt to stop you bleeding
But nothing ever stops you leaving

Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

Don't you know too much already?
I'll only hurt you if you let me
Call me friend, but keep me closer
(Call me back)
And I'll call you when the party's over

Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
Yeah, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

But nothing is better, sometimes
Once we've both said our goodbyes
Let's just let it go
Let me let you go

Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
---------------------------------------------------
Someone said they left together
I ran out the door to get her
She was holding hands with Trevor
Not the greatest feeling ever
Said, "Pull yourself together
You should try your luck with Heather"
Then I heard they slept together
Oh, the less I know the better
The less I know the better

Oh my love, can't you see yourself by my side
No surprise when you're on his shoulder like every night
Oh my love, can't you see that you're on my mind
Don't suppose you could convince your lover to change his mind
So goodbye

She said, "It's not now or never
Wait 10 years, we'll be together"
I said, "Better late than never
Just don't make me wait forever"
Don't make me wait forever
Don't make me wait forever

Oh my love, can't you see yourself by my side?
I don't suppose you could convince your lover to change his mind

I was doing fine without ya
'Til I saw your face, now I can't erase
Giving in to all his bullshit
Is this what you want, is this who you are?
I was doing fine without ya
'Til I saw your eyes turn away from mine
Oh, sweet darling, where he wants you
Said, "Come on Superman, say your stupid line"
Said, "Come on Superman, say your stupid line"
Said, "Come on Superman, say your stupid line"
---------------------------------------------------
And you got me like, "Oh, what you want from me?"
(What you want from me?)
And I tried to buy your pretty heart, but the price too high
Baby, you got me like "Oh"
You love when I fall apart (fall apart)
So you can put me together and throw me against the wall

Baby you got me like i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-hiii, woo i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-hiii
Don't you stop loving me (loving me)
Don't quit loving me (loving me)
Just start loving me (loving me)
Ow

And babe I'm fist-fighting with fire
Just to get close to you
Can we burn something babe
And I run for miles just to get a taste
Must be love on the brain
That's got me feeling this way
It beats me black and blue but it fucks me so good
And I can't get enough
Must be love on the brain yeah
And it keeps cursing my name
No matter what I do
I'm no good without you
And I can't get enough
Must be love on the..... brain

Baby keep loving me
Just love me
Yeah, just love me
All you need to do is love me, yeah
Got me like, ah-ha-ha-ow
I'm tired of being played like a violin
What do I gotta do to get in your motherfucking heart?
Baby like i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-hiii, woo i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-hiii

Baby you got me like i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-hiii, woo i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-hiii
Don't you stop loving me (loving me)
Don't quit loving me (loving me)
Just start loving me (loving me)
Ooh

And babe I'm fist-fighting with fire
Just to get close to you
Can we burn something babe
And I run for miles just to get a taste
Must be love on the brain
That's got me feeling this way
It beats me black and blue but it fucks me so good
And I can't get enough
Must be love on the brain yeah
And it keeps cursing my name
No matter what I do
I'm no good without you
And I can't get enough
Must be love on the.... brain
---------------------------------------------------
Take you like a drug
I taste you on my tongue

You ask me what I'm thinking about
I tell you that I'm thinking about
Whatever you're thinking about (Ah)
Tell me something that I'll forget
And you might have to tell me again
It's crazy what you'll do for a friend

Go ahead and cry, little girl
Nobody does it like you do
I know how much it matters to you
I know that you got daddy issues
And if you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I know that you got daddy issues, and I do too

I tried to write your name in the rain
But the rain never came
So I made with the sun
The shade
Always comes at the worst time (Ah)

You ask me what I'm thinking about
I tell you that I'm thinking about
Whatever you're thinking about
Tell me something that I'll forget
And you might have to tell me again
It's crazy what you'll do for a friend

Go ahead and cry, little girl
Nobody does it like you do
I know how much it matters to you
I know that you got daddy issues
And if you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I know that you got daddy issues

I keep on trying to let you go
I'm dying to let you know
How I'm getting on
I didn't cry when you left at first
But now that you're dead it hurts
This time I gotta know
Where did my daddy go?
I'm not entirely here
Half of me has disappeared

Go ahead and cry, little boy
You know that your daddy did too
You know what your mama went through
You gotta let it out soon, just let it out

Go ahead and cry, little girl
Nobody does it like you do
I know how much it matters to you
I know that you got daddy issues
And if you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I know that you got daddy issues, and I do too

If you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I know that you got daddy issues, and I do too
---------------------------------------------------
What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawin' me in and you kickin' me out
You've got my head spinnin', no kiddin'
I can't pin you down
What's goin' on in that beautiful mind?
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me
But I'll be alright

My head's under water, but I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginnin'
Even when I lose, I'm winnin'

'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh

How many times do I have to tell you?
Even when you're crying, you're beautiful too
The world is beating you down, I'm around
Through every mood
You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing
In my head for you

My head's under water, but I'm breathin' fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginnin'
Even when I lose, I'm winnin'

'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh

Give me all of you, oh
Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts
Risking it all, though it's hard

'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginnin'
Even when I lose, I'm winnin'

'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you

I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh
---------------------------------------------------
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
'Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long, that
Even my momma thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how you talkin' and where you walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke, fool
I'm the kinda G the little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the streetlight

Been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise

Look at the situation they got me facin'
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the state
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watchin' got me chasin' dreams
I'm a educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set trippin' banger
And my homies is down so don't arouse my anger
Fool, death ain't nothin' but a heart beat away
I'm livin' life do or die, what can I say?
I'm 23 now, but will I live to see 24?
The way things is goin' I don't know

Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?

Been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise

Power and the money, money and the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's runnin', but half of them ain't lookin'
It's goin' on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'
They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
I guess they can't, I guess they won't
I guess they frontin', that's why I know my life is out of luck, fool!

Been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise

Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?
Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?
---------------------------------------------------
I've seen the world, done it all
Had my cake now
Diamonds, brilliant, and Bel Air now
Hot summer nights, mid-July
When you and I were forever wild
The crazy days, city lights
The way you'd play with me like a child

Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?

I've seen the world, lit it up as my stage now
Channeling angels in the new age now
Hot summer days, rock and roll
The way you'd play for me at your show
And all the ways I got to know
Your pretty face and electric soul

Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?

Dear Lord, when I get to heaven
Please, let me bring my man
When he comes, tell me that You'll let him in
Father, tell me if You can
All that grace, all that body
All that face makes me wanna party
He's my sun, he makes me shine like diamonds

Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?

Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?
Will you still love me when I'm not young and beautiful?
---------------------------------------------------
Enviyon on the mix
No, no, no, no
No-no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you so I must replace you (oh)
Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listening to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but
I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you so I must replace you (oh)
Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listening to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but
I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head

I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past
But I want it to last
You were made outta plastic (fake)
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heart break

You made my heart break
You made my heart ache
(I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache
(Can't take back the love that I gave you)
You made my heart break
(Were made outta plastic fake)
You made my heart ache
(I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break again
(I was tangled up your drastic ways)
(Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?)

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you so I must replace you (oh)
Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listening to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but
I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you so I must replace you (oh)
Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listening to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but
I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

Leave this shit in the past but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic (fake)
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?

Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
(Instead of my head)
I won't let you forget me

Someone told me long ago
There's a calm before the storm
I know, it's been coming for some time
When it's over, so they say
It'll rain a sunny day
I know, shining down like water

I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain?
I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain?
Coming down on a sunny day

Yesterday, and days before
Sun is cold and rain is hard
I know, been that way for all my time
'Til forever, on it goes
Through the circle, fast and slow
I know, it can't stop, I wonder

I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain?
I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain?
Coming down on a sunny day

Yeah!

I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain?
I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain?
Coming down on a sunny day

---------------------------------------------------
Never made it as a wise man
I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealing
Tired of livin' like a blind man
I'm sick of sight without a sense of feeling
And this is how you remind me

This is how you remind me of what I really am
This is how you remind me of what I really am

It's not like you to say sorry
I was waitin' on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breakin'
And I've been wrong, I've been down
Been to the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream, "Are we havin' fun yet?"

Yet, yet, yet, no, no
Yet, yet, yet, no, no

It's not like you didn't know that
I said, "I love you," and I swear I still do
And it must have been so bad
'Cause livin' with me must have damn near killed you

And this is how you remind me of what I really am
This is how you remind me of what I really am

It's not like you to say sorry
I was waitin' on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breakin'
And I've been wrong, I've been down
Been to the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream, "Are we havin' fun yet?"

Yet, yet, yet, no, no
Yet, yet, yet, no, no
Yet, yet, yet, no, no
Yet, yet, yet, no, no

Never made it as a wise man
I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealin'
And this is how you remind me
This is how you remind me

This is how you remind me of what I really am
This is how you remind me of what I really am

It's not like you to say sorry
I was waitin' on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breakin'
And I've been wrong, I've been down
Been to the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream, "Are we havin' fun yet?"

Yet, yet, are we havin' fun yet?
Yet, yet, are we havin' fun yet?
Yeah, yeah (These five words in my head scream)
Are we havin' fun yet?
Yeah, yeah (These five words in my head)
No, no
---------------------------------------------------
Nah, but, listen, I'm following my dreams, I'm chasing my, my, my, my dreams, uhm, accomplishing all my goals. I'm doing what I'm supposed to do. And that's, you know, niggas, they always gonna be there

Really hate saying sorry
Gotta be another way
I know you hurt regardless
Tryna take away the pain
I know I've done some foolish things before
I know that I've been swerving on this course
Checking myself, cause I just can't ignore, oh, oh

Can find me somewhere writing when Im wrong
Girl, I'm just tryna see if I belong
Mistakes feel like a fracture in my bones

Sitting here, patching myself up
Crying over what's left, cause
Without you I ain't shit, but no pressure
Guess I gotta learn my lesson

We over the same shit
Swinging for the fence, but somehow I can't hit
You wonder why I came here
Despite a couple kinks, don't no shame hang here
I know I've said some foolish things before
I know that I've been swerving on this course
A lot of shit that you just can't ignore, oh, oh, oh

Can find me somewhere writing when Im wrong
Girl, I'm just tryna see if I belong
Mistakes feel like a fracture in my bones
Do all this work only to fuck it up
But I'm not down for quitting on your love
It's twisted but I just can't get enough

Sitting here, patching myself up
Crying over what's left, cause
Without you I ain't shit, but no pressure
Guess I gotta learn my lesson

So I'ma write, when I'm wrong
Haven't I already shown
What it's like to love someone so much
You treat their heart like it was your own

Sitting here, patching myself up
Crying over what's left, cause
Without you I ain't shit, but no pressure
Guess I gotta learn my lesson

Rights, wrongs
I'm just tryna s-, oh
It feels like a fracture of bones, oh, oh
---------------------------------------------------
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffing paint and I love her the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
She fucking hates me and I love it
"Wait! Where you going?"
"I'm leaving you!"
"No you ain't. Come back"
We're running right back
Here we go again
It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed I snap
"Who's that dude?"
"I don't even know his name"
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em
You meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feeling
Yeah, them chills used to get 'em
Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at 'em
You swore you'd never hit 'em; never do nothing to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face spewing venom in your words when you spit them
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em
So lost in the moments when you're in them
It's the rage that took over
It controls you both
So they say it's best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know you 'cause today that was yesterday
Yesterday is over, it's a different day
Sound like broken records playing over but you promised her
Next time you'd show restraint
You don't get another chance
Life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Now I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
And we fall back into the same patterns, same routines
But your temper's just as bad as mine is
You're the same as me
When it comes to love you're just as blinded
Baby, please come back
It wasn't you, baby it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk
Told you this is my fault
Look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games I just want her back
I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fucking leave again
I'mma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
I'm just gonna

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
---------------------------------------------------
Oh, life is bigger
It's bigger than you
And you are not me
The length that I will go to
The distance in your eyes
(The distance in your eyes)
Oh no, I've said too much
I set it up
(I set it up)

That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
I'm losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

Every whisper
Of every waking hour
I'm choosing my confessions
Trying to keep an eye on you
Like a hurt, lost and blinded fool
Oh no I've said too much
I set it up

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try
But that was just a dream
Try, cry, why
I think I thought I saw you try

Consider this
Consider this, the hint of the century
Consider this, the slip
That brought me to my knees failed
What if all these fantasies come
Flailing around
Now I've said, and now I've said too much

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try
But that was just a dream
Try, cry, why (try)
That was just a dream, just a dream, just a dream
---------------------------------------------------
Once upon a younger year
When all our shadows disappeared
The animals inside came out to play
Went face to face with all our fears
Learned our lessons through the tears
Made memories we knew would never fade

One day my fatherhe told me
"Son, don't let it slip away"
He took me in his arms, I heard him say

"When you get older
Your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid"

He said, "One day you'll leave this world behind
So, live a life you will remember"
My father told me when I was just a child
"These are the nights that never die"
My father told me

"When thunder clouds start pouring down
Light a fire they can't put out
Carve your name into those shining stars"
He said, "Go venture far beyond the shores
Don't forsake this life of yours
I'll guide you home no matter where you are"

One day my fatherhe told me
"Son, don't let it slip away"
When I was just a kid I heard him say

"When you get older
Your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid"

He said, "One day you'll leave this world behind
So, live a life you will remember"
My father told me when I was just a child
"These are the nights that never die"
My father told me

"These are the nights that never die"
My father told me
My father told me
---------------------------------------------------
Am I throwin' you off?
Nope
Didn't think so

How you doin', young lady?
That feeling that you giving really drives me crazy
You don't, have a player 'bout to choke
I was at a loss for words first time that we spoke
You're lookin' for a girl that'll treat you right?
How you're lookin' for her in the daytime with the light?
You might be the type if I play my cards right
I'll find out by the end of the night
You expect me to just let you hit it?
But will you still respect me if you get it?
All I can do is try, gimme one chance (Chance)
What's the problem? I don't see no ring on your hand (Hand)
I'll be the first to admit it
I'm curious about you, you seem so innocent
You wanna get in my world, get lost in it?
Boy, I'm tired of runnin', let's walk for a minute

Promiscuous girl, wherever you are
I'm all alone, and it's you that I want
Promiscuous boy, you already know
That I'm all yours, what you waiting for?
Promiscuous girl, you're teasin' me
You know what I want, and I got what you need
Promiscuous boy, let's get to the point
'Cause we're on a roll, you ready?

Roses are red, some diamonds are blue
Chivalry is dead, but you're still kinda cute
Hey, I can't keep my mind off you
Where you at? Do you mind if I come through?
I'm out of this world, come with me to my planet
Get you on my level, do you think that you can handle it?
They call me Thomas, last name Crown
Recognize game, I'ma lay mines down
I'm a big girl, I can handle myself
But if I get lonely, I'ma need your help
Pay attention to me, I don't talk for my health
I want you on my team
So does everybody else
Shh, baby, we can keep it on the low (Low)
Let your guard down, ain't nobody gotta know (Know)
If you with it, girl, I know a place we can go
What kind of girl do you take me for?

Promiscuous girl, wherever you are
I'm all alone, and it's you that I want
Promiscuous boy, you already know
That I'm all yours, what you waiting for?
Promiscuous girl, you're teasin' me
You know what I want, and I got what you need
Promiscuous boy, let's get to the point
'Cause we're on a roll, you ready?

Don't be mad, don't get mean
Don't get mad, don't be mean
Hey, don't be mad, don't get mean
Don't get mad, don't be mean

Wait, I don't mean no harm
I can see you with my T-shirt on
I can see you with nothin' on
Feelin' on me before you bring that on
Bring that on?!
You know what I mean
Girl, I'm a freak, you shouldn't say those things
I'm only trying to get inside of your brain
To see if you can work me the way you say
It's OK, it's alright
I got something that you gon' like
Hey, is that the truth or are you talking trash?
Is your game M.V.P. like Steve Nash?

Promiscuous girl, wherever you are
I'm all alone, and it's you that I want
Promiscuous boy, I'm callin' your name
But you're drivin' me crazy the way you're makin' me wait
Promiscuous girl, you're teasin' me
You know what I want, and I got what you need
Promiscuous boy, we're one and the same
So we don't gotta play games no more
---------------------------------------------------
I took my drugs and took my lovin' when I left out the spot
I left the party with a Barbie, marking X on the dot
She calls my phone up, but I told her, "I'm a loner" (Uh)
But she likes my watch and my droptop and my persona (Uh)
We hit the highway, one-five-five with my whole foot on the dash
She's in my ear, she's got no fear, she could care less if we crash

But on my radar, I've got some nerve to play hard
I waited for my chance, but playboys, we don't dance, dance, dance

I lost my heart (Uh)
Speedin' car, goin' ninety in the rain
She took my heart, filled it with nothin' but pain
This beat in my dance is not for romance
I wanna stay, but playboys, we don't dance, dance, dance (I)

So I won't dance again (I), oh, baby
No, I won't dance again (That's why), oh, yeah (Uh)
No, I won't dance again (I)
No, I won't dance again
Pretty baby, ooh

Uh
Face in the daylight, wastin' time on the stars in the sky
She's got my pager, blankets of love fall on my eyes
Then I'm reminded, love don't come 'til you find it
I just hope that it's workin', I'm yearnin', I'm searchin', uh
The afterparty was on Wilson and 73rd
You got the notion that somebody else was with me first

But on my radar, you had some nerve to play hard
You took away my chance, but playboys, we don't dance, dance, dance

I lost my heart (Uh)
Speedin' car goin' ninety in the rain
She took my heart, filled it with nothin' but pain
This beat in my dance is not for romance
I wanna stay, but playboys, we don't dance, dance, dance (I)

So I won't dance again (I), oh, baby
No, I won't dance again (That's why), oh, yeah (Uh)
No, I won't dance again (I)
No, I won't dance again
Pretty baby, ooh
---------------------------------------------------
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh, girl for goodness' sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own. Well, I ain't

And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care. I don't
But you still hit my phone up
And, baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job
Didn't see what's going on
But now I know
I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care. I don't
But you still hit my phone up
And, baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job
Didn't see what's going on
But now I know
I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love. Now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think (you think) that I'm (that I'm) still holdin' on (holdin' on) to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
---------------------------------------------------
I've been watching you for some time
Can't stop staring at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes

No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

I've been walking through a world gone blind
Can't stop thinking of your diamond mind
Careful creature made friends with time
He left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes

No fair (No fair)
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes (Those ocean eyes)
I'm scared (I'm scared)
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes


Those ocean eyes
Falling into your ocean eyes
I've never fallen from quite this high
I'm scared
When you give me those ocean eyes
You really know how to make me cry
No fair

Da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da
Mm
Mm

No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
---------------------------------------------------
It's going down, I'm yelling timber
You better move, you better dance
Let's make a night you won't remember
I'll be the one you won't forget

Whoa (timber), whoa (timber), whoa (it's going down)
Whoa (timber), whoa (timber), whoa (it's going down)


The bigger they are, the harder they fall
These big-iddy boys are dig-gidy dogs
I have 'em like Miley Cyrus, clothes off
Twerking in their bras and thongs, timber
Face down, booty up, timber
That's the way we like towhat?timber
I'm slicker than an oil spill

I thought that I was dreaming when you said you love me
The start of nothing, I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you coming
The start of nothing, ooh, I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
When we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

If I could see through walls, I could see you're faking
If you could see my thoughts, you would see our faces
Safe in my rental like an armored truck back then
We didn't give a fuck back then
I ain't a kid no more, we'll never be those kids again
We'd drive to Syd's, had the X6 back then, back then
No matter what I did, my waves wouldn't dip back then
Everything sucked back then, we were friends

I thought that I was dreaming when you said you love me
The start of nothing, I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you coming
The start of nothing, ooh, I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
But we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

In the halls of your hotel
Arm around my shoulder so I could tell
How much I meant to you, meant it sincere back then
We had time to kill back then
You ain't a kid no more, we'll never be those kids again
It's not the same, ivory's illegal, don't you remember?

I broke your heart last week
You'll probably feel better by the weekend
Still remember, had you going crazy
Screaming my name, the feeling deep down is good

I thought that I was dreaming when you said you love me
The start of nothing, had no chance to prepare
Couldn't see you coming
And we started from nothing, ooh, I could hate you now
It's alright to hate me now
We both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

All the things I didn't mean to say, I didn't mean to do
There were things you didn't need to say
Did you mean to? Mean to
I've been dreaming of you, dreaming of you
I've been dreaming of you, dreaming of you
I've been dreaming, dreaming
---------------------------------------------------
They're rotting my brain, love
These hoes are the same

I admit it, another hoe got me finished
Broke my heart, oh no you didn't
Fuck sippin', I'mma down a whole bottle
Hard liquor, hard truth can't swallow
Need a bartender, put me out my sorrow
Wake up the next day in the Monte Carlo
With a new woman
Tell me she from Colorado
And she love women
She'll be gone by tomorrow
Who am I kiddin'
All this jealousy and agony that I sit in
I'm a jealous boy, really feel like John Lennon
I just want real love, guess it's been a minute
Pissed off from the way that I don't fit in, I don't fit in
Tell me what's the secret to love, I don't get it
Feel like I be runnin' a race I'm not winnin'
Ran into the devil today and she grinnin'

Hey, these girls are insane
All girls are the same
They're rotting my brain, love
Think I need a change
Before I go insane, love
All girls are the same
They're rotting my brain, love
Think I need a change
Before I go insane, love

Ten minutes, she told me it would take ten minutes
To break my heart, oh no she didn't
Fuck living, Imma drown in my sorrow
Fuck giving, Imma take not borrow
And I'm still sinnin'
I'm still losing my mind
I know I been trippin'
I'm still wasting my time
All the time given, am I dying, am I living
It's fuck feelin's, my sorrow go up to the ceilin'

Now I am insane
Demons in my brain, love
Peace I can't obtain
Cause all these girls the same, love
Now I am insane
Demons in my brain, love
Peace I can't obtain
Cause all these girls the same, love
---------------------------------------------------
We found each other
I helped you out of a broken place
You gave me comfort
But falling for you was my mistake

I put you on top, I put you on top
I claimed you so proud and openly
And when times were rough, when times were rough
I made sure I held you close to me

So call out my name (call out my name)
Call out my name when I kiss you so gently
I want you to stay (want you to stay)
I want you to stay, even though you don't want me
Girl, why can't you wait? (Why can't you wait, baby?)
Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of love?
Won't you call out my name? (Call out my name)
Girl, call out my name, and I'll be on my way and
I'll be on my

I said I didn't feel nothing, baby, but I lied
I almost cut a piece of myself for your life
Guess I was just another pit stop
'Til you made up your mind
You just wasted my time

You were on top, I put you on top
I claimed you so proud and openly, babe
And when times were rough, when times were rough
I made sure I held you close to me!

So call out my name (call out my name, baby)
So call out my name when I kiss you
So gently, oh, I want you to stay (I want you to stay)
I want you to stay even though you don't want me
Girl, why can't you wait? (Girl, why can't you wait 'til I?)
Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of loving?
Babe, call out my name (say call out my name, baby)
Girl, call out my name, and I'll be on my way
And I'll be on my

On my way, on my way
On my way, on my way, ooh
On my way, on my way, on my way
On my way, on my way, on my way
(On my)
---------------------------------------------------
I still remember
Third of December
Me in your sweater
You said it looked better

On me, than it did you
Only if you knew
How much I liked you
But I watch your eyes, as she

Walks by
What a sight for
Sore eyes
Brighter than a
Blue sky
She's got you
Mesmerized
While I die

Why would you ever kiss me?
I'm not even half as pretty
You gave her your sweater
It's just polyester, but you like her better
Wish I were Heather

Watch as she stands with
Her holding your hand
Put your arm 'round her shoulder
Now I'm getting colder

But how could I hate her?
She's such an angel
But then again, kinda
Wish she were dead, as she

Walks by
What a sight for
Sore eyes
Brighter than a
Blue sky
She's got you
Mesmerized
While I die

Why would you ever kiss me?
I'm not even half as pretty
You gave her your sweater
It's just polyester, but you like her better
I wish I were Heather

Wish I were Heather
Wish I were Heather

Why would you ever kiss me?
I'm not even half as pretty
You gave her your sweater
It's just polyester
But you like her better
Wish I were
---------------------------------------------------
I walked across an empty land
I knew the pathway like the back of my hand
I felt the earth beneath my feet
Sat by the river and it made me complete

Oh simple thing, where have you gone?
I'm getting tired and I need someone to rely on

I came across a fallen tree
I felt the branches of it looking at me
Is this the place we used to love?
Is this the place that I've been dreaming of?

Oh simple thing, where have you gone?
I'm getting old and I need something to rely on

And if you have a minute why don't we go
Talk about it somewhere only we know?
This could be the end of everything
So why don't we go
Somewhere only we know?
Somewhere only we know?

Oh simple thing, where have you gone?
I'm getting old and I need someone to rely on
So tell me when you're gonna let me in
I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin

And if you have a minute why don't we go
Talk about it somewhere only we know?
'Cause this could be the end of everything
So why don't we go?
Somewhere only we know?
Somewhere only we know?
---------------------------------------------------
Oh, ey

You don't know babe
When you hold me
And kiss me slowly
It's the sweetest thing
And it don't change
If I had it my way
You would know that you are

You're the coffee that I need in the morning
You're my sunshine in the rain when it's pouring
Won't you give yourself to me
Give it all, oh


I just wanna see
I just wanna see how beautiful you are
You know that I see it
I know you're a star
Where you go I'll follow
No matter how far
If life is a movie
Oh you're the best part, oh
You're the best part, oh
Best part


It's this sunrise
And those brown eyes, yes
You're the one that I desire
When we wake up
And then we make love
It makes me feel so nice

You're my water when I'm stuck in the desert
You're the Tylenol I take when my head hurts
You're the sunshine on my life


I just wanna see how beautiful you are
You know that I see it
I know you're a star
Where you go I'll follow
No matter how far
If life is a movie
Then you're the best part, oh
You're the best part, oh
Best part

If you love me won't you say something
If you love me won't you
Won't you
If you love me won't you say something
If you love me won't you
Love me, won't you
If you love me won't you say something
If you love me won't you
If you love me won't you say something
If you love me won't you
Love me, won't you
If you love me won't you say something
If you love me won't you
If you love me won't you say something
If you love me won't you
Love me, won't you

Eating seeds as a pastime activity
The toxicity of our city, of our city

New, what do you own the world?
How do you own disorder, disorder
Now, somewhere between the sacred silence, sacred silence and sleep
Somewhere between the sacred silence and sleep
Disorder, disorder, disorder

More wood for their fires, loud neighbours
Flashlight reveries caught in the headlights of a truck

They wanna take what's yours, they wanna go for dinner on your name
I let them take control and take me for a fool, it's such a shame
I never said a word in all the time that I waited was a waste

They wanna see me stressed out everyday, I know it
They wanna lie and still be friends
But when you're at your worst they're not there
And you discover that they don't care, so

You didn't know any better, doesn't it feel unfair?
(Doesn't it, doesn't it)

They wanna see me stressed out everyday, I know it

Doesn't it feel unfair? (Oh, you wanna check on me now?)

Every night
I take myself to where the skies are blue
To where we swam when I met you

Stay here
I spent the best days of my life with you
Watching clouds form in the distance
I watched the sunset on the beach with you
It's not over yet

I want your love
And I want it bad
I just wanna treat you better
I just wanna treat you better
I want your love
And I want it bad
I just wanna treat you better
I just wanna treat you better

Let's begin again
Let's get back to where we started
When there was talk of getting older
I'll be waiting by the water
Let's start over

I want your love
And I want it bad
I just wanna treat you better
I just wanna treat you better
I want your love
And I want it bad
I just wanna treat you better
I just wanna treat you better

I know that the words don't change it
I know that your heart keeps aching
I just wanna treat you better
I just wanna treat you better
Even when the light can't find me
I know that the sun keeps shining
I just wanna treat you better
I just wanna treat you better
Oh, I just wanna treat you better
I just wanna treat you better
I just wanna treat you better
I just wanna treat you better

That Arizona sky burning in your eyes
You look at me and, babe, I wanna catch on fire
It's buried in my soul like California gold
You found the light in me that I couldn't find

So when I'm all choked up
But I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye
Baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way

Lovers in the night
Poets tryna write
We don't know how to rhyme
But damn we try
But all I really know
You're where I wanna go
The part of me that's you will never die

So when I'm all choked up
But I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye
Baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way

Oh, yeah
I don't wanna be just a memory, baby, yeah
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo hoo hooooooooo

So when I'm all choked up
But I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye
Baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way, way, yeah

When you look at me
And the whole world fades
I'll always remember us this way

Oooh, oooh, hmmmm
Oooh, oooh, hmmmm

Drink from me, drink from me
That I shoot across the sky
Symphony
That I shoot across the sky
We're on a...
Drink from me, drink from me
That I shoot across the sky
Symphony
(So high, so high)
That I shoot across the sky


Oh, angel sent from up above
You know you make my world light up
When I was down, when I was hurt
You came to lift me up
Life is a drink, and love's a drug
Oh, now I think I must be miles up
When I was a river, dried up
You came to rain a flood


You said drink from me, drink from me
When I was so thirsty
Poured on a symphony
Now I just can't get enough
Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Poured on a symphony
When I'm low, low, low, low


I, oh, I, oh, I
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Now I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Woo!


Oh, angel sent from up above
I feel it coursing through my blood
Life is a drink, your love's about
To make the stars come out

Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Poured on a symphony
When I'm low, low, low, low


I, oh, I, oh, I
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh I, oh, I, oh, I
Now I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high


I, oh, I, oh, I
La la la la la la la
So high, so high
I, oh, I, oh, I
I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high

That I shoot across the sky
That I shoot across the...
That I shoot across the sky
Watch me shoot across the..
That I shoot across the sky
That I shoot across the...
That I shoot across the sky
That I shoot across the...
---------------------------------------------------
The lights go out and I can't be saved
Tides that I tried to swim against
Have brought me down upon my knees
Oh I beg, I beg and plead, singing

Come out of things unsaid
Shoot an apple off my head and a
Trouble that can't be named
A tiger's waiting to be tamed, singing

You are
You are

Confusion never stops
Closing walls and ticking clocks
Gonna come back and take you home
I could not stop that you now know, singing

Come out upon my seas
Cursed missed opportunities
Am I a part of the cure?
Or am I part of the disease? Singing

You are, you are, you are
You are, you are, you are

And nothing else compares
Oh nothing else compares
And nothing else compares

You are
You are

Home, home where I wanted to go
Home, home where I wanted to go
Home, home where I wanted to go
Home, home where I wanted to go
---------------------------------------------------
We're rolling suicide

Wake up (wake up)
Grab a brush and put a little make-up
Hide the scars to fade away the shake-up (hide the scars to fade away the...)
Why'd you leave the keys upon the table?
Here you go create another fable

You wanted to
Grab a brush and put a little makeup
You wanted to
Hide the scars to fade away the shake-up
You wanted to
Why'd you leave the keys upon the table?
You wanted to

I don't think you trust
In my self-righteous suicide
I cry when angels deserve to
Die

Wake up (wake up)
Grab a brush and put a little make-up
Hide the scars to fade away the shake-up (hide the scars to fade away the...)
Why'd you leave the keys upon the table?
Here you go create another fable

You wanted to
Grab a brush and put a little make-up
You wanted to
Hide the scars to fade away the shake-up
You wanted to
Why'd you leave the keys upon the table?
You wanted to

I don't think you trust
In my self-righteous suicide
I cry when angels deserve to die
In my self-righteous suicide
I cry when angels deserve to die

Father, father, father, father
Father, into your hands I commend my spirit
Father, into your hands
Why have you forsaken me?
In your eyes forsaken me
In your thoughts forsaken me
In your heart forsaken me, oh

Trust in my self-righteous suicide
I cry when angels deserve to die
In my self-righteous suicide
I cry when angels deserve to die
---------------------------------------------------
This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the earth move and then
Hear my heart burst again

For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall
That skyfall

Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number, you can take my name
But you'll never have my heart

Let the sky fall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together

Let the sky fall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together
At skyfall


(Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall)

Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know I'd never be me
Without the security
Of your loving arms
Keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand

Let the sky fall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together

Let the sky fall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together
At skyfall

Let the sky fall
We will stand tall
At skyfall
Oh-s...
---------------------------------------------------
I know you're somewhere out there
Somewhere far away
I want you back, I want you back
My neighbors think I'm crazy
But they don't understand
You're all I had, you're all I had

At night when the stars light up my room
I sit by myself

Talking to the moon
Tryna get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me, too
Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?

I'm feeling like I'm famous, the talk of the town
They say I've gone mad
Yeah, I've gone mad
But they don't know what I know
'Cause when the sun goes down, someone's talking back
Yeah, they're talking back, oh

At night when the stars light up my room
I sit by myself

Talking to the moon
Tryna get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me, too
Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?

Do you ever hear me calling?
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
'Cause every night, I'm talking to the moon

Still trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me, too
Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?

Oh-oh
I know you're somewhere out there
Somewhere far away
---------------------------------------------------
'Cause sometimes you just feel tired
Yo, left, yo, left
Feel weak and when you feel weak
Yo, left, right, left
You feel like you wanna just give up
Yo, left, yo left
But you gotta search within you
Yo, left, right, left
Try to find that inner strength and just pull that shit out of you
Yo, left, yo left
And get that motivation to not give up
Yo, left, right, left
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad
Yo, left, yo left
You wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse
Yo, left, right, left

'Til I collapse I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em
'Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pennin' 'em
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin' 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal, cop-killin', hip-hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're comin' with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?
Fa' shizzle, my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck

'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
Until the roof, until the roof
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
Until my legs, until my legs
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
Give out from underneath me

Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get
When you real and you spit, and people are feelin' your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes: Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
Andre from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney  Nate, hit me!

'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
Until the roof, until the roof
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
Until my legs, until my legs
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
Give out from underneath me

Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll prob'ly never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em
The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?
'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so

'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
Until the roof, until the roof
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
Until my legs, until my legs
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
Give out from underneath me

Until the roof, until the roof
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
Until my legs, until my legs
Give out from underneath me
I, I will not fall, I will stand tall
Feels like no one could beat me
---------------------------------------------------
Remember the time baby


I ain't got no money
I ain't got no car to take you on a date
I can't even buy you flowers
But together we can be the perfect soul mates
Talk to me girl


Oh, baby, it's alright now, you ain't gotta flaunt for me
If we go Dutch, you can still touch my love, it's free
We can work without the perks just you and me
Thug it out 'til we get it right


Baby if you strip, you can get a tip
'Cause I like you just the way you are
(I'm about to strip and I'm well equipped
Can you handle me the way I are?)
I don't need the Gs or the car keys
Boy I like you just the way you are
Let me see you strip, you can get a tip
'Cause I like, I like, I like


I ain't got no Visa
I ain't got no Red American Express
We can't go nowhere exotic
It don't matter 'cause I'm the one that loves you best
Talk to me girl


Oh, baby, it's alright now, you ain't gotta flaunt for me
If we go Dutch, you can still touch my love, it's free
We can work without the perks just you and me
Thug it out 'til we get it right


Baby if you strip, you can get a tip
'Cause I like you just the way you are
(I'm about to strip and I'm well equipped
Can you handle me the way I are?)
I don't need the Gs or the car keys
Boy I like you just the way you are
Let me see you strip, you can get a tip
'Cause I like you just the way you are


Baby girl, I don't got a huge old house I rent a room in a house
Listen baby girl, I ain't got a motorboat but I can float your boat
So listen baby girl, once you get a dose of D.O.E. you're gon' want some more
So listen baby girl, when I make it I want you there, want you there, yeah
---------------------------------------------------
On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
"This could be Heaven or this could be Hell"
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (Any time of year)
You can find it here

Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

So I called up the Captain
"Please bring me my wine."
He said, "We haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine."
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis

Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice
And she said "We are all just prisoners here, of our own device"
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast

Last thing I remember
I was running for the door
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
"Relax," said the night man
"We are programmed to receive
You can check-out any time you like
But you can never leave!"
---------------------------------------------------
Sunday morning, man, she woke up fighting mad
Bitching and moaning on and on 'bout the time I had
And by Tuesday, you could say that girl was good as gone
And then when Thursday came around, I was all alone

So I went for a drive to clear my mind, ended up at a Shell on I-65

Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch off ticket
Bought two twelve packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time, oh, but she was wrong
I was caller number 5 on the radio station
Won a 4-day, 3-night beach vacation
Deep sea, senorita, fishing down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my ex future mother-in-law anymore
Oh, Lord, when it rains it pours

Now she was sure real quick to up and apologize
When she heard about my new found luck on that FM dial
And it's crazy how lately now it just seems to come in waves
What I thought was gonna be the death of me was my saving grace

It's got me thinking that her leaving is the only logical reason

That I got the last spot in the Hooter's parking lot
And the waitress left her number on my check with a heart
She picked up on the first ring when I gave her a call
And I only spent five bucks at the Moose Club Raffle
Won a used four-wheeler and three free passes
For me and two of my buddies to play a round of golf
And I ain't gotta see my ex future mother-in-law anymore
Oh, Lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours

I've been on one hell of a redneck roll for three weeks now
And it all started on the day that she walked out

Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch off ticket
Bought two twelve packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time, oh, but she was wrong
And I was caller number 5 on the radio station
Won a 4-day, 3-night beach vacation
Deep sea, senorita, fishing down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my ex future mother-in-law anymore
Oh, Lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours
---------------------------------------------------
Back in black, I hit the sack
I've been too long, I'm glad to be back
Yes, I'm let loose from the noose
That's kept me hanging about
I'm just looking at the sky 'cause it's getting me high
Forget the hearse, 'cause I'll never die
I got nine lives, cat's eyes
Abusing every one of them and running wild

'Cause I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, back
Well, I'm back in black
Yes, I'm back in black

Back in the back of a Cadillac
Number one with a bullet, I'm a power pack
Yes, I'm in a bang with a gang
They've got to catch me if they want me to hang
'Cause I'm back on the track and I'm beatin' the flack
Nobody's gonna get me on another rap
So, look at me now, I'm just making my play
Don't try to push your luck, just get out of my way

'Cause I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, back
Well, I'm back in black
Yes, I'm back in black

Well, I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, back
Well, I'm back in black
Yes, I'm back in black, yow

Ah, yeah
Oh, yeah
Take my love
Yeah, yeah
Yeah
Ah, hey yeah
Ooh, yeah

Well, I'm back (I'm back)
Back, well I'm (I'm back)
Back (I'm back)
Back (I'm back)
Back (I'm back)
Back, back in black
Yes, I'm back in black

I've hit the sack
---------------------------------------------------
You call me again, drunk in your Benz
Drivin' home under the influence
You scared me to death, but I'm wastin' my breath
'Cause you only listen to your fuckin' friends
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city

And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fuckin' sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends
So I shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid

You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just fuckin' leave me alone
---------------------------------------------------
I cannot take this anymore
Saying everything I've said before
All these words: they make no sense
I find bliss in ignorance
Less I hear the less you'll say
You'll find that out anyway

Just like before...

Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
I'm about to break

I find the answers aren't so clear
Wish I could find a way to disappear
All these thoughts: they make no sense
I find bliss in ignorance
Nothing seems to go away
Over and over again

Just like before...

Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
I'm about to break

Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to... break!

Shut up when I'm talking to you
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up when I'm talking to you
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up
I'm about to break!

Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
I'm about to break

Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to...
Break!
---------------------------------------------------
Living easy, lovin' free
Season ticket on a one way ride
Asking nothing, leave me be
Taking everythin' in my stride
Don't need reason, don't need rhyme
Ain't nothing I'd rather do
Goin' down, party time
My friends are gonna be there too, yeah

I'm on the highway to hell
On the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell

No stop signs, speed limit
Nobody's gonna slow me down
Like a wheel, gonna spin it
Nobody's gonna mess me around
Hey Satan, payin' my dues
Playing in a rocking band
Hey mama, look at me
I'm on the way to the promised land
Woo!

I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell

Don't stop me
Heh, heh!

I'm on the highway to hell
On the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
(Highway to hell) I'm on the highway to hell
(Highway to hell) Highway to hell
(Highway to hell) Highway to hell
(Highway to hell)

And I'm going down
All the way
I'm on the highway to hell
---------------------------------------------------
Hold on, hold on, fuck that
Fuck that shit
Hold on, I got to start this motherfuckin' record over again, wait a minute
Fuck that shit
Still on this motherfuckin' record
I'ma play this motherfucker for y'all
Ay, y'all get some more drinks goin' on
I'll sound a whole lot better

Listen
Seein' you got ritualistic
Cleansin' my soul of addiction for now
'Cause I'm fallin' apart, yeah
Tension
Between us just like picket fences
You got issues that I won't mention for now
'Cause we're fallin' apart

Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no

Listen
Harder buildin' trust from a distance
I think we should rule out commitment for now
'Cause we're fallin' apart
Leavin'
You're just doing that to get even
Don't pick up the pieces, just leave it for now
They keep fallin' apart

Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no

Um, trying to think of the right thing to say
---------------------------------------------------
Mum mum mum mah

I wanna hold 'em like they do in Texas, please (Woo)
Fold 'em, let 'em hit me, raise it, baby, stay with me (I love it)

I won't tell you that I love you
Kiss or hug you

I'm not lyin', I'm just stunnin' with my love-glue-gunnin'
Just like a chick in the casino
Take your bank before I pay you out
I promise this, promise this
Check this hand 'cause I'm marvelous

Can't read my, can't read my

---------------------------------------------------
My lover's got humour
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner

If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week

"We were born sick," you heard them say it

My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, "Worship in the bedroom"
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you

I was born sick
But I love it
Command me to be well
Aaay. Amen. Amen. Amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the Goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice

Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine-looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful

That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

No Masters or Kings
When the Ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin

In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human
Only then I am clean
Ooh oh. Amen. Amen. Amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

Lay where you're laying
Don't make a sound
I know they're watching
They're watching

All the commotion
The kiddie-like play
It has people talking
Talking

You
Your sex is on fire

The dark of the alley
The breaking of day
Head while I'm driving
I'm driving

Soft lips are open
Them knuckles are pale
Feels like you're dying
You're dying

You
Your sex is on fire
Consumed
With what's just transpired

Hot as a fever
Rattle of bones
I could just taste it
Taste it

If this not forever
If this just tonight
Oh we're still the greatest
The greatest
The greatest

You
Your sex is on fire

You
Your sex is on fire
Consumed
With what's just transpired

And you
Your sex is on fire
Consumed
With what's just transpired
---------------------------------------------------
Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive

It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Shine a light through an open door
Love and life I will divide
Turn away 'cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind

It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine (mine, mine, mine)

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Tell me somethin', girl
Are you happy in this modern world?
Or do you need more?
Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?

I'm falling
In all the good times I find myself longin' for change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself


Tell me something, boy
Aren't you tired tryna fill that void?
Or do you need more?
Ain't it hard keeping it so hardcore?

I'm falling
In all the good times I find myself longin' for change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself

I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now


In the sha-ha-sha-ha-low
In the sha-ha-sha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-ha-sha-ha-ha-low
We're far from the shallow now


Oh, ha, ah, ha
Oh-ah, ha
Oh, ha, ah, ha

I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now


In the sha-ha-sha-ha-low
In the sha-ha-sha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-ha-sha-ha-ha-low
We're far from the shallow now

Step one, you say we need to talk
He walks, you say, "Sit down, it's just a talk"
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all, you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
And pray to God He hears you
And I pray to God He hears you, and

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or break with the ones you've followed
He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

How to save a life
How to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

How to save a life
How to save a life

Tastes like strawberries on a summer evenin'

I was so high I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered "Goodbye" as she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart, oh

This love has taken its toll on me
She said "Goodbye" too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice 'cause I won't say "Goodbye" anymore

Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh

I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied, oh
Kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again
But I know

This love has taken its toll on me
She said "Goodbye" too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice 'cause I won't say "Goodbye" anymore

Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh

I'll fix these broken things
Repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's alright
(It's alright, it's alright)
My pressure on your hips
Sinking my fingertips
Into every inch of you
'Cause I know that's what you want me to do

This love has taken its toll on me
She said "Goodbye" too many times before
Her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice 'cause I won't say "Goodbye" anymore

This love has taken its toll on me
She said "Goodbye" too many times before
And my heart is breaking in front of me
She said "Goodbye" too many times before

This love has taken its toll on me
(Oh, yeah, yeah)
She said "Goodbye" too many times before
(Yeah)
And her heart is breaking in front of me
(Yeah)
And I have no choice 'cause I won't say "Goodbye" anymore

This love has taken its toll on me

Once upon a time, not so long ago

Tommy used to work on the docks
Union's been on strike, he's down on his luck
It's tough
So tough
Gina works the diner all day
Working for her man, she brings home her pay
For love
Mm, for love

She says, "We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot"

Whoa, we're halfway there
Whoa-oh, living on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear
Whoa-oh, living on a prayer

Tommy's got his six-string in hock
Now he's holding in, when he used to make it talk
So tough
Ooh, it's tough
Gina dreams of running away
When she cries in the night, Tommy whispers
"Baby, it's okay
Someday"

We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot

Whoa, we're halfway there
Whoa-oh, living on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
Whoa-oh, living on a prayer, living on a prayer

Ooh, we gotta hold on, ready or not
You live for the fight when that's all that you've got

Whoa, we're halfway there
Whoa-oh, living on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Whoa-oh, living on a prayer

Whoa, we're halfway there
Whoa-oh, living on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Whoa-oh, living on a prayer

Whoa, we're halfway there
Whoa-oh, living on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Whoa-oh, living on a prayer

I took an arrow to the heart
I never kissed a mouth that tastes like yours
Strawberries and then something more
Ooh yeah, I want it all

Lipstick on my guitar
Fill up the engine, we can drive real far
Go dancing underneath the stars
Ooh yeah, I want it all

Mmm, you got me feeling like

I wanna be that guy
I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile
I wanna feel like I
Like my soul's on fire
I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah, you got me singing like

Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up
Give me the shivers
Oh baby, you wanna dance till the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over then we'll bring it right back

And we'll say
Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up
Give me the shivers
Oh baby, you wanna dance till the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over then we'll bring it right back

Into the car
On the backseat in the moonlit dark
Wrap me up between your legs and arms
Ooh, I can't get enough

You know you could tear me apart
Put me back together and take my heart
I never thought that I could love this hard
Ooh, I can't get enough

Mmm, you got me feeling like

Used to spend my nights out in a barroom
Liquor was the only love I'd known
But you rescued me from reaching for the bottom
And brought me back from being too far gone

You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

I've looked for love in all the same old places
Found the bottom of the bottle's always dry
But when you poured out your heart I didn't waste it
'Cause there's nothing like your love to get me high

You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time



You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey

You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly (Fly)
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried (Cried, cried, cried, cried)
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care (Might care, might care)

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

And you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'"

I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

And you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'"

If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?

I miss the taste of a sweeter life
I miss the conversation
I'm searching for a song tonight
I'm changing all of the stations

I like to think that we had it all
We drew a map to a better place
But on that road I took a fall
Oh, baby, why did you run away?

I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest nights

But I wonder, where were you
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back?
So I wonder, where were you
When all the roads you took came back to me?

So I'm following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following

I hear your voice in my sleep at night
Hard to resist temptation
'Cause something strange has come over me
And now I can't get over you
No, I just can't get over you, ooh

I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest nights

But I wonder where were you
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back?
So I wonder where were you
When all the roads you took came back to me?

So I'm following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Yeah yeah yeah

Oh, in your darkest times
Oh, I was there for you
Oh, in your darkest nights

Oh, I was there for you

But I wonder, where were you
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back?
So I wonder, where were you
When all the roads you took came back to me?

So I'm following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do

Hey
He-e-e-e-ey
He-e-e-e-ey

Your lipstick stains
On the front lobe of my left-side brains
I knew I wouldn't forget you
And so I went and let you blow my mind
Your sweet moonbeam
The smell of you in every single dream I dream
I knew when we collided
You're the one I have decided who's one of my kind

Hey, soul sister
Ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair, you know
Hey, soul sister
I don't wanna miss a single thing you do
Tonight

Hey
He-e-e-e-ey
He-e-e-e-ey

Just in time
I'm so glad you have a one-track mind like me
You gave my life direction
A game-show love connection we can't deny
I'm so obsessed
My heart is bound to beat right out my untrimmed chest
I believe in you, like a virgin, you're Madonna
And I'm always gonna wanna blow your mind

Hey, soul sister
Ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair, you know
Hey, soul sister
I don't wanna miss a single thing you do
Tonight

The way you can cut a rug
Watching you's the only drug I need
So gangster, I'm so thug
You're the only one I'm dreaming of, you see
I can be myself now finally
In fact, there's nothing I can't be
I want the world to see you'll be with me

Hey, soul sister
Ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair, you know
Hey, soul sister
I don't wanna miss a single thing you do tonight
Hey, soul sister
I don't wanna miss a single thing you do
Tonight

Hey
He-e-e-e-ey
He-e-e-e-ey
Tonight
Hey
He-e-e-e-ey
He-e-e-e-ey
Tonight

One, two, three, four

Settle down with me
Cover me up
Cuddle me in

Lie down with me
And hold me in your arms

And your heart's against my chest, your lips pressed to my neck
I'm falling for your eyes, but they don't know me yet
And with a feeling I'll forget, I'm in love now

Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
Falling in love
We're falling in love

Settle down with me
And I'll be your safety
You'll be my lady

I was made to keep your body warm
But I'm cold as the wind blows so hold me in your arms

Oh no
My heart's against your chest, your lips pressed to my neck
I'm falling for your eyes, but they don't know me yet
And with this feeling I'll forget, I'm in love now

Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
Falling in love
We're falling in love

Yeah I've been feeling everything
From hate to love
From love to lust
From lust to truth
I guess that's how I know you
So I hold you close to help you give it up

So kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
Falling in love
We're falling in love

Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
Falling in love
We're falling in love

I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me

You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down

I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

If "Happy Ever After" did exist
I would still be holding you like this

All those fairy tales are full of shit

All those fairy tales are full of it

One more fucking love song, I'll be sick

One more stupid love song, I'll be sick

Oh, you turned your back on tomorrow
'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away

You can't expect me to be fine (Oh-oh)
I don't expect you to care (Yeah)
I know I've said it before
But all of our bridges burned down

I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it "love"
But even the sun sets in paradise

I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you (Oh, oh-oh-oh)
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two? (Yeah)

If "Happy Ever After" did exist
I would still be holding you like this

All those fairy tales are full of shit

All those fairy tales are full of it

One more fucking love song, I'll be sick (Yeah, uh)

One more stupid love song, I'll be sick, oh
Now I'm at a payphone


Yeah, yeah, now baby don't hang up
So I can tell you what you need to know
Baby I'm begging you just please don't go
So I can tell you what you need to know


Man, fuck that shit
I'll be out spending all this money
While you're sitting 'round wondering
Why it wasn't you who came up from nothing
Made it from the bottom
Now when you see me I'm stunting
And all of my cars start with a push of a button
Telling me I changed since I blew up
Or whatever you call it
Switched the number to my phone
So you never could call it
Don't need my name on my shirt
You can tell that I'm balling
Swish, what a shame could have got picked
Had a really good game but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could have saw but sad to say it's over for
Phantom pulled up valet open doors
Wished I'd go away, got what you was looking for
Now it's me who they want, so you can go and take
That little piece of shit with you (Yeah)

I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you (Woo)
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong (Yeah)
Where are the plans we made for two? (Yeah)

If "Happy Ever After" did exist (Oh)
I would still be holding you like this

All those fairy tales are full of shit (Yeah)

All those fairy tales are full of it

One more fucking love song, I'll be sick, oh

One more stupid love song, I'll be sick, yeah
Now I'm at a payphone
---------------------------------------------------
Through drought and famine, natural disasters
My baby has been around for me
Kingdoms have fallen, angels be calling
None of that could ever make me leave
Every time I look into your eyes I see it
You're all I need
Every time I get a bit inside I feel it

Oooooooh, who could've thought I'd get you
Oooooooh, who could've thought I'd get you

And when we're making love
Your cries they can be heard from far and wide
It's only the two of us
Everything I need's between those thighs
Every time I look into your eyes I see it
You're all I need
Every time I get a bit inside I feel it

Oooooooh, who could've thought I'd get you
Oh yeah
Oh yeah babe
Oooooooh, who could've thought I'd get you


And I'll take some time
Just to be thankful
That I had days full of you, you
Before it winds down into
The memories, it's all just memories


(If you've got someone you like...)
Don't you love when I come around
(...feel something that's right somebody just tell somebody)
Build you up then I take you down
(If you've got someone you like...)
Don't you love when I come around
(...feel something that's right somebody just tell somebody)
Build you up then I take...


Oooooooh, who could've thought I'd get you
Oooooooh, who could've thought I'd get you


This feels like summer
Boy you make me feel so alive
Just be my lover
Boy you'll lead me to paradise
---------------------------------------------------
The birds have left their trees
The light pours onto me
I can feel you lying there all on your own
We got here the hard way
All those words that we exchange
Is it any wonder things get broke?

Cause in my heart and in my head
I'll never take back the things I said
So high above, I feel it coming down
She said, in my heart and in my head
Tell me why this has to end
Oh, no, oh, no

I can't save us, my Atlantis, we fall
We built this town on shaky ground
I can't save us, my Atlantis, oh, no
We built it up to pull it down

Now all the birds have fled
The hurt just leaves me scared
Losing everything I've ever known
It's all become too much
Maybe I'm not built for love
If I knew that I could reach you, I would go

It's in my heart and in my head
You can't take back the things you said
So high above, I feel it coming down
She said, in my heart and in my head
Tell me why this has to end
Oh, no, oh, no

I can't save us, my Atlantis, we fall
We built this town on shaky ground
I can't save us, my Atlantis, oh, no
We built it up to pull it down

And we build it up and we build it up
And we build it up to pull it down
And we build it up and we build it up
And we build it up to pull it down

I can't save us, my Atlantis, we fall
We built this town on shaky ground
I can't save us, my Atlantis, oh, no
We built it up to pull it down
---------------------------------------------------
There ain't no gold in this river
That I've been washing my hands in forever
I know there is hope in these waters
But I can't bring myself to swim
When I am drowning in this silence
Baby, let me in

Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me

There ain't no room for things to change
When we are both so deeply stuck in our ways
You can't deny how hard I have tried
I changed who I was to put you both first
But now I give up

Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
Had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me

I had good intentions
And the highest hopes
But I know right now
It probably doesn't even show

Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
I didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me
---------------------------------------------------
You're insecure
Don't know what for
You're turning heads when you walk through the door
Don't need make-up
To cover up
Being the way that you are is enough


Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you


Baby you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know
Oh, oh
You don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'd understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know
Oh, oh
You don't know you're beautiful
Oh, oh
That's what makes you beautiful


So c-come on
You got it wrong
To prove I'm right
I put it in a song
I don't know why
You're being shy
And turn away when I look into your eye-eye-eyes


Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you


Baby you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know
Oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know
Oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful
Oh oh


That's what makes you beautiful

Nana nana nana nana
Nana nana nana nana
Nana nana nana nana


Baby you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell


You don't know
Oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful

Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know
Oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful (Oh)
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
(
desperately)
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know
Oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful
Oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful
Oh oh


That's what makes you beautiful
---------------------------------------------------
I was a liar
I gave in to the fire
I know I should've fought it
At least I'm being honest
Feel like a failure
'Cause I know that I failed you
I should've done you better
'Cause you don't want a liar

And I know, and I know, and I know
She gives you everything
But, boy, I couldn't give it to you
And I know, and I know, and I know
That you got everything
But I got nothing here without you

So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise, after that, I'll let you go
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home

I don't deserve it
I know I don't deserve it
But stay with me a minute
I swear I'll make it worth it
Can't you forgive me?
At least just temporarily
I know that this is my fault
I should've been more careful

And I know, and I know, and I know
She gives you everything
But, boy, I couldn't give it to you
And I know, and I know, and I know
That you got everything
But I got nothing here without you, baby

So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise, after that I'll let you go
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home (la li he)

I know I should've fought it
At least I'm being honest (yeah)
But stay with me a minute
I swear I'll make it worth it, babe
'Cause I don't wanna be without you

(Oh)
So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home (takes you home, babe)
One more time
I promise, after that I'll let you go
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart (babe)
All I really care is you wake up in my arms (wake up in my arms)
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home (yeah)

One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
---------------------------------------------------
I met you in the dark
You lit me up
You made me feel as though
I was enough
We danced the night away
We drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute I was stone-cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told you
I think that you should get some rest

I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you
But I never showed
But I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I'll wake you up with some
Breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee
With a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars
For that night

When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that every day you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling, your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far, my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me
When I needed you most

I'm gonna love you 'til
My lungs give out
I promise 'til death we part
Like in our vows
So I wrote this song for you
Now everybody knows
That it's just you and me
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

Just say you won't let go
Oh, just say you won't let go
---------------------------------------------------
Shady


Konvict, Upfront
Akon, Slim Shady
I see the one, could she be that lady? Ay

I feel you creepin', I can see it from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo?
And possibly bend you over?

Look back and watch me smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Upfront style, ready to attack now
Pull in the parking lot slow with the 'Lac down
Konvict's got the whole thing packed now
Step in the club, the wardrobe intact now
I feel it, dawnin' cracked now
Ooh, I see it dull and backed now
I'ma call her, then I put the mack down
Money no problem, pocket full of that now

I feel you creepin', I can see it from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo?
And possibly bend you over?

Look back and watch me smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh


Oh, looks like another club banger
They better hang on when they throw this thang on
Get a little drink on, they gon' flip
For this Akon shit, you can bank on it
Pedicure, manicure, kitty-cat claws
The way she climbs up and down them poles
Lookin' like one of them Putty-Cat Dolls
Tryin' to hold my woodie back through my drawers
Steps off stage, didn't think I saw her
Creeps up behind me, and she's like "You're"
I'm like, "I know, let's cut to the chase
No time to waste, back to my place"
Plus from the club to the crib's like a mile away
Or more like a palace, shall I say
And plus, I got a pal if your gal is game
In fact, he's the one singin' the song that's playin' (Akon!)


I feel you creepin', I can see it from my shadow (My shadow)
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo? (Like Tae Bo?)
And possibly bend you over? (Ooh, yeah)

Look back and watch me smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more (Yeah)
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Yeah, yeah)

Eminem's rollin', D and 'em rollin'
Bu and all marvelous, them rollin'
Women just ho-in', big booty rollin'
Soon, I'll be all in them and throwin' D (D)
Hittin' no less than three (Three)
Block wheel style like whee (Whee)
Girl, I can tell you want me, 'cause lately

I feel you creepin', I can see it from my shadow (Yeah, my shadow)
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo? (Like Tae Bo?)
And possibly bend you over? (Ooh, yeah)

Look back and watch me smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
---------------------------------------------------
I am a little bit of loneliness, a little bit of disregard
Handful of complaints, but I can't help the fact that everyone can see these scars
I am what I want you to want, what I want you to feel
But it's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you, to just believe this is real

So I let go watching you, turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I got


I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored


I am a little bit insecure, a little unconfident
'Cause you don't understand I do what I can but sometimes I don't make sense
I am what you never wanna say, but I've never had a doubt
It's like no matter what I do I can't convince you for once just to hear me out

So I let go watching you, turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got


I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored

Now
Hear me out now
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not
Right now
Hear me out now
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not
Right now

I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored

I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored

I can't feel
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
Time won't heal
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
---------------------------------------------------
You and me, we made a vow
For better or for worse
I can't believe you let me down
But the proof's in the way it hurts

For months on end I've had my doubts
Denying every tear
I wish this would be over now
But I know that I still need you here

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

You've been so unavailable
Now sadly I know why
Your heart is unobtainable
Even though Lord knows you kept mine

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

I have loved you for many years
Maybe I am just not enough
You've made me realize my deepest fear
By lying and tearing us up

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

I know I'm not the only one
I know I'm not the only one
And I know
And I know
And I know
And I know
And I know
And I don't know
I know I'm not the only one
---------------------------------------------------
A thousand years, a thousand more
A thousand times a million doors to eternity
I may have lived a thousand lives, a thousand times
An endless turning stairway climbs
To a tower of souls
If it takes another thousand years, a thousand wars
The towers rise to numberless floors in space
I could shed another million tears, a million breaths
A million names but only one truth to face

A million roads, a million fears
A million suns, ten million years of uncertainty
I could speak a million lies, a million songs
A million rights, a million wrongs in this balance of time
But if there was a single truth, a single light
A single thought, a singular touch of grace
Then following this single point, this single flame
The single haunted memory of your face

I still love you
I still want you
A thousand times the mysteries unfold themselves
Like galaxies in my head

I may be numberless, I may be innocent
I may know many things, I may be ignorant
Or I could ride with kings and conquer many lands
Or win this world at cards and let it slip my hands
I could be cannon food, destroyed a thousand times
Reborn as fortune's child to judge another's crimes
Or wear this pilgrim's cloak, or be a common thief
I've kept this single faith, I have but one belief

I still love you
I still want you
A thousand times the mysteries unfold themselves
Like galaxies in my head
On and on the mysteries unwind themselves
Eternities still unsaid
'Til you love me
---------------------------------------------------
I wanna hold the hand inside you
I wanna take the breath that's true
I look to you and I see nothing
I look to you to see the truth
You live your life, you go in shadows
You'll come apart and you'll go blind
Some kind of night into your darkness
Colors your eyes with what's not there

Fade into you
Strange you never knew
Fade into you
I think it's strange you never knew

A stranger light comes on slowly
A stranger's heart without a home
You put your hands into your head
And then its smiles cover your heart

Fade into you
Strange you never knew
Fade into you
I think it's strange you never knew
Fade into you
Strange you never knew
Fade into you
I think it's strange you never knew

I think it's strange you never knew

I knew my rent was gon' be late about a week ago (Hey)

But I'ma have a good time balling tonight
Tell the bartender, "Line up some shots"
'Cause I'ma get loose tonight
She's on fire, she's so hot
I'm no liar, she burned up the spot
Look like Mariah, I took another shot
And told her drop, drop, drop, drop it like it's hot

Dirty talk (Hey), dirty dance (Hey)
She a freaky girl (Hey) and I'm a freaky man (Hey)
She on the rebound, broke up with her ex
And I'm like Rodman, ready on deck

Party every night like my last
Mami know the drill, shake that ass
Go ahead, baby, let me see what you got
You know you got the biggest booty in this spot
And I just wanna see that thing drop
From the back, to the front, to the top

You know me, I'm off in the cut
Always like a squirrel looking for a nut
This is a for sure, I'm not talking 'bout luck
I'm not talking 'bout love, I'm talking 'bout lust
Now let's get loose, have some fun
Forget about bills and the first of the month
It's my night, your night, our night, let's turn it up


I knew my rent was gon' be late about a week ago
I worked my ass off, but I still can't pay it though
But I got just enough to get off in this club
Have me a good time, before my time is up
Hey, let's get it now

Ooh, I want the time of my life, yeah, oh, baby
Ooh, give me the time of my life, hey, hey, hey

Everybody going through something

So you might as well roll it up
Pour it up, drink it up, throw it up tonight

I said, everybody going through something
(Everybody going through something)
Ay, said, everybody going through something

So you might as well roll it up
Pour it up, drink it up, throw it up tonight, oh, yeah, yeah

Believe me, been there, done that
But every day above ground is a great day, remember that
Dale

Turn your magic on
Umi she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
We are legends every day
That's what she told me

Turn your magic on
To me she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
Under this pressure
Under this weight
We are diamonds

Now I feel my heart beating
I feel my heart underneath my skin
And I feel my heart beating
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again
Alive again
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again

Said I can't go on
Not in this way
I'm a dream that died by light of day
Gonna hold up half the sky and say
Only I own me

And I feel my heart beating
I feel my heart underneath my skin
Oh, I can feel my heart beating
'Cause you make me feel
Like I'm alive again
Alive again
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again

Turn your magic on
Umi she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
Under this pressure under this weight
We are diamonds taking shape
We are diamonds taking shape

If we've only got this life
This adventure, oh, then I
And if we've only got this life
You get me through

If we've only got this life
In this adventure, oh, then I
Want to share it with you
With you
With you
Yeah I do
Woohoo
Woohoo
Woohoo
---------------------------------------------------
You are my fire
The one desire
Believe when I say
I want it that way

But we are two worlds apart
Can't reach to your heart
When you say
That I want it that way

Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say
I want it that way

Am I your fire
Your one desire
Yes I know it's too late
But I want it that way

Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say
I want it that way

Now I can see that we're falling apart
From the way that it used to be, yeah
No matter the distance
I want you to know
That deep down inside of me

You are my fire
The one desire
You are
You are, you are, you are

Don't wanna hear you say
Ain't nothing but a heartache
Ain't nothing but a mistake (don't wanna hear you say)
I never wanna hear you say (oh, yeah)
I want it that way

Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a mistake
Tell me why

Sitting at the bar
Crashing to the place we met
The world we fell into
Saw you at that night
Dancing with the tears of a thorn
You can get trought the tears

But don't you try so hard
With your heart
Cause not this time

Don't be afraid of us, girl
Just let it go
We need to cut the line
But we're alright
Don't be afraid of the time
Just let it flow
We can write down the good
In a good-bye

Shared our thoughts with wine
I brought hapiness in your eyes
Talking about north to south

But don't you try so hard
With your heart
Cause not this time

Don't be afraid of us, girl
Just let it go
We need to cut the line
But we're alright
Don't be afraid of the time
Just let it flow
We can write down the good
In a good-bye

Oh, we'll survive
Oh, we'll survive
Without us
Never know what could be
On the other side

Don't be afraid of us, girl
Just let it go
We need to cut the line
But we're alright
Don't be afraid of the time
Just let it flow
We can write down the good
In a good-bye

(Let it go, let it go)
Just let it go (let it go)
Dont be afraid of the time (let it go, let it go)
Just let it go (let it go)

I can see the sight
One day we can go back in time
And become who we were
---------------------------------------------------
We hug and yes, we make love
And always just say "Goodnight" (La-la-la-la-la)
And we cuddle, sure I do love it
But I need your lips on mine

Can you kiss me more?
We're so young, boy
We ain't got nothin' to lose, oh oh
It's just principle
Baby, hold me
'Cause I like the way you groove, oh oh

Boy, you write your name, I can do the same
Ooh, I love the taste, oh-la-la-la-la-la
All on my tongue, I want it
Boy, you write your name, I can do the same
Ooh, I love the taste, oh-la-la-la-la-la
All on my tongue, I want it

I, I feel like fuckin' something
But we could be corny, fuck it
Sugar, I ain't no dummy-dummy
I like to say, what if, but if
We could kiss and just cut the rubbish
Then I might be onto somethin'
I ain't givin' you one in public
I'm givin' you hundreds, fuck it
Somethin' we just gotta get into
Sign first, middle, last, on the wisdom tooth
Niggas wishin' that the pussy was a kissin' booth
Taste breakfast, lunch and gin and juice
And that dinner just like dessert too
And when we French, refresh gimme too
When I bite that lip, come get me too
He want lipstick, lipgloss, hickeys too, uh

Can you kiss me more?
We're so young, boy
We ain't got nothin' to lose, oh oh
It's just principle
Baby, hold me
'Cause I like the way you groove, oh oh

Boy, you write your name, I can do the same
Ooh, I love the taste, oh-la-la-la-la-la
All on my tongue, I want it
Boy, you write your name, I can do the same
Ooh, I love the taste, oh-la-la-la-la-la
All on my tongue, I want it

Say give me a buck, need that gushy stuff
Push the limit, no you ain't good enough
All your niggas say that you lost without me
All my bitches feel like I dodged the county
Fuckin' with you feel like jail, nigga
I can't even exhale, nigga
Pussy like holy grail, you know that
You gon' make me need bail, you know that
Caught dippin' with your friend
You ain't even half man, lyin' on ya
, you know that
Got me a bag full of brick, you know that
Control, don't slow the pace if I throw back
All this ass for real (Ah)
Drama make you feel (Ah)
Fantasy and whip appeal
Is all I can give you

Can you kiss me more?
We're so young, boy
We ain't got nothin' to lose, oh oh
It's just principle
Baby, hold me
'Cause I like the way you groove, oh oh
Oh, darling

Boy, you write your name, I can do the same
Ooh, I love the taste, oh-la-la-la-la-la
All on my tongue, I want it
Boy, you write your name, I can do the same
Ooh, I love the taste, oh-la-la-la-la-la
All on my tongue, I want it

Just stop your crying
It's a sign of the times
Welcome to the final show
Hope you're wearing your best clothes

You can't bribe the door on your way to the sky
You look pretty good down here
But you ain't really good

We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets, the bullets?
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
Your bullets, the bullets?

Just stop your crying
It's a sign of the times
We gotta get away from here
We gotta get away from here
Just stop your crying
It'll be alright
They told me that the end is near
We gotta get away from here

Just stop your crying
Have the time of your life
Breaking through the atmosphere
And things are pretty good from here

Remember, everything will be alright
We can meet again somewhere
Somewhere far away from here

We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets, the bullets?
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets, the bullets?

Just stop your crying
It's a sign of the times
We gotta get away from here
We gotta get away from here
Stop your crying
Baby, it'll be alright
They told me that the end is near
We gotta get away from here

We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets, the bullets?
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
Your bullets, the bullets?

We don't talk enough
We should open up
Before it's all too much
Will we ever learn?
We've been here before
It's just what we know

Stop your crying, baby
It's a sign of the times
We gotta get away
We got to get away
We got to get away
We got to get away
We got to get away
We got towe got toaway
We got towe got toaway
We got towe got toaway
---------------------------------------------------
If you, if you could return
Don't let it burn
Don't let it fade
I'm sure I might be rude
But it's just your attitude
It's tearing me apart
It's ruining everything
And I swore, I swore I would be true
And honey, so did you
So why were you holding her hand?
Is that the way we stand?
Were you lying all the time?
Was it just a game to you?

But I'm in so deep
You know I'm such a fool for you
You've got me wrapped around your finger
Do you have to let it linger?
Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?

Oh, I thought the world of you
I thought nothing could go wrong
But I was wrong, I was wrong
If you, if you could get by
Trying not to lie
Things wouldn't be so confused
And I wouldn't feel so used
But you always really knew
I just wanna be with you

And I'm in so deep
You know I'm such a fool for you
You've got me wrapped around your finger
Do you have to let it linger?
Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?

And I'm in so deep
You know I'm such a fool for you
You've got me wrapped around your finger
Do you have to let it linger?
Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?
You know I'm such a fool for you
You've got me wrapped around your finger
Do you have to let it linger?
Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?
---------------------------------------------------
Yeah
Breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things

Yeah
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who would have thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)

My wrist, stop watchin'
My neck is flossy
Make big deposits
My gloss is poppin'

You like my hair?
Gee, thanks! Just bought it
I see it, I like it
I want it, I got it
Yeah

I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it

(Yep)

Wearin' a ring but ain't gon' be no "Mrs."
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction

Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, "Which one?" I say, "Nah, I want all of 'em"
Happiness is the same price as "red-bottoms"

My smile is beamin' (yeah)
My skin is gleamin' (is gleamin')
The way it shine
I know you've seen it
You've seen it

I bought a crib
Just for just for the closet closet
Both his and hers
I want it, I got it
Yeah

I want it, I got it
Baby

You like my hair?
Gee, thanks! Just bought it
Oh, yeah
I see it, I like it
I want it, I got it
Yep

Yeah, my receipts be lookin' like phone numbers
If it ain't money, then wrong number
Black Card is my business card
The way it be settin' the tone for me

I don't mean to brag
But I be like, "Put it in the bag"
Yeah
When you see them racks
They stacked up like my ass
Yeah

Shoot
Go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop
Gimme the loot
Never mind, I got the juice
Nothin' but net when we shoot

Look at my neck
Look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it then that's what I get
Yeah

I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
(Oh yeah)
Yeah
I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
Oh, yeah, yeah

You like my hair?
Gee, thanks! Just bought it
I see it, I like it
I want it, I got it
(I see, yep)

When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?

And, darling, I will be loving you 'til we're 70
And, baby, my heart could still fall as hard at 23
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, meI fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

So, honey, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way (mmm...)
I know you will still love me the same

'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And, baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
Well, I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

That, baby, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
Thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are (oh, oh)

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, lo-ud

So, baby, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh, darling, place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
But maybe we found love right where we are
Oh, baby, we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are
---------------------------------------------------
Scar tissue that I wish you saw
Sarcastic mister know-it-all
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
'Cause with the birds I'll share

With the birds, I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds, I'll share this lonely viewin'

Ah, push me up against the wall
Young Kentucky girl in a push-up bra
Ah, fallin' all over myself
To lick your heart and taste your health, 'cause

With the birds (Share this lone), I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds (Share this lone), I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds (Share this lone), I'll share this lonely view

Blood loss in a bathroom stall
A southern girl with a scarlet drawl
I wave good-bye to Ma and Pa
'Cause with the birds I'll share

With the birds (Share this lonely), I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds (Share this lonely), I'll share this lonely viewin'

Soft-spoken with a broken jaw
Step outside but not to brawl and
Autumn's sweet, we call it fall
I'll make it to the moon if I have to crawl and

(I will share this lonely)
With the birds, I'll share this lonely viewin'
(I will share this lonely)
With the birds, I'll share this lonely viewin'
(I will share this lonely)
With the birds, I'll share this lonely view

Scar tissue that I wish you saw
Sarcastic mister know-it-all
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
'Cause with the birds I'll share

(I will share this lonely)
With the birds, I'll share this lonely viewin'
(I will share this lonely)
With the birds, I'll share this lonely viewin'
(I will share this lonely)
With the birds, I'll share this lonely view
---------------------------------------------------
You could never know what it's like
Your blood like winter freezes just like ice
And there's a cold lonely light that shines from you
You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use

And did you think this fool could never win?
Well, look at me, I'm a-coming back again
I got a taste of love in a simple way
And if you need to know while I'm still standing you just fade away

Don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did?
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
And I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

I'm still standing. Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm still standing. Yeah, yeah, yeah

Once I never could've hoped to win
You're starting down the road leaving me again
The threats you made were meant to cut me down
And if our love was just a circus you'd be a clown by now

You know I'm still standing better than I ever did
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

I'm still standing. Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm still standing. Yeah, yeah, yeah

Don't you know that I'm still standing better than I ever did?
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
And I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

I'm still standing. Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm still standing. Yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm still standing. Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm still standing. Yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm still standing. Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm still standing. Yeah, yeah, yeah
---------------------------------------------------
One, two, three, uh!

My baby don't mess around
Because she loves me so, and this I know for sure (Uh)
But does she really wanna
But can't stand to see me walk out the door? (Ah)
Don't try to fight the feeling
'Cause the thought alone is killing me right now (Uh)
Thank God for Mom and Dad
For sticking two together 'cause we don't know how (C'mon)

Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!

You think you've got it, oh, you think you've got it
But "got it" just don't get it 'til there's nothing at all (Ah!)
We get together, oh, we get together
But separate's always better when there's feelings involved (Ah)
If what they say is, "Nothing is forever"
Then what makes, then what makes, then what makes
Then what makes, what makes, what makes love the exception?
So why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh
Are we so in denial when we know we're not happy here?
Y'all don't wanna hear me, you just wanna dance

Hey ya! (Uh-oh) Hey ya! (Uh-oh)

Don't speak, no, don't try
It's been a secret for the longest time
Don't run, huh, no don't hide
Been running from it for the longest time

So many mornings I woke up confused
In my dreams, I do anything I want to you
My emotions are naked, they're taking me out of my mind

Right now I'm shameless
Screaming my lungs out for ya
Not afraid to face it
I need you more than I want to
Need you more than I want to
Show me you're shameless
Write it on my neck, why don't ya?
And I won't erase it
I need you more than I want to
Need you more than I want to

(No uh, no uh, don't wanna do this now)
(No uh, no uh, don't wanna do this now)
(No uh, no uh, don't wanna do this now)
(No uh, no uh, don't wanna do this now)

It's all there, now it's real
Now that you have me, do you want me still?
My kisses are history they go back a long time
Uh, and I'm tired of loving
Somebody that's not mine

So many mornings I woke up confused
In my dreams, I do anything I want to you
My emotions are naked, they're taking me out of my mind

Right now I'm shameless
Screaming my lungs out for ya
Not afraid to face it
I need you more than I want to
Need you more than I want to
Show me you're shameless
Write it on my neck, why don't ya?
And I won't erase it
I need you more than I want to
Need you more than I want to

(No uh, no uh, don't wanna do this now)
(No uh, no uh, don't wanna do this now)
(No uh, no uh, don't wanna do this now)
(No uh, no uh, don't wanna do this now)

Distance, inches in between us
I want you to give in
I want you to give in
Weakness, tension in between us
I just wanna give in
And I don't care if I'm forgiven

Right now I'm shameless
Screaming my lungs out for ya
Not afraid to face it
I need you more than I want to
Need you more than I want to
Show me you're shameless
Write it on my neck, why don't ya?
And I won't erase it
I need you more than I want to
Need you more than I want to

(No uh, no uh, don't wanna do this now)

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you're the best

I got my red dress on tonight
Dancing in the dark in the pale moonlight
Done my hair up real big beauty queen style
High heels off, I'm feeling alive

Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzling like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothing scares me anymore

(1, 2, 3, 4)

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you're the best

I got that summertime, summertime sadness
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I'm feeling electric tonight
Cruising down the coast going 'bout 99
Got my bad baby by my heavenly side
I know if I go, I'll die happy tonight

Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzling like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothing scares me anymore

(1, 2, 3, 4)

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you're the best

I got that summertime, summertime sadness
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Think I'll miss you forever
Like the stars miss the sun in the morning sky
Later's better than never
Even if you're gone I'm gonna drive (drive, drive)

I got that summertime, summertime sadness
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you're the best

It's a beautiful night
We're looking for something dumb to do
Hey, baby
I think I wanna marry you

Is it the look in your eyes
Or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares, baby?
I think I wanna marry you

Well I know this little chapel on the boulevard we can go oh oh oh
No one will know oh oh oh
Oh, come on, girl
Who cares if we're trashed? Got a pocket full of cash we can blow
Shots of Patron
And it's on, girl

Don't say no, no, no, no-no
Just say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah
And we'll go, go, go, go-go
If you're ready, like I'm ready

'Cause it's a beautiful night
We're looking for something dumb to do
Hey, baby
I think I wanna marry you

Is it the look in your eyes
Or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares, baby?
I think I wanna marry you

I'll go get a ring let the choir bells sing like "Ooh"
So what you wanna do?
Let's just run, girl

If we wake up and you wanna break up that's cool
No, I won't blame you
It was fun, girl

Don't say no, no, no, no-no
Just say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah
And we'll go, go, go, go-go
If you're ready, like I'm ready

'Cause it's a beautiful night
We're looking for something dumb to do
Hey, baby
I think I wanna marry you

Is it the look in your eyes
Or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares, baby
I think I wanna marry you

Just say "I do."
Tell me right now, baby
Tell me right now, baby, baby
Just say "I do."
Tell me right now, baby
Tell me right now, baby, baby

Oh, it's a beautiful night
We're looking for something dumb to do
Hey, baby
I think I wanna marry you

Is it the look in your eyes
Or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares, baby?
I think I wanna marry you
---------------------------------------------------
I'm going back to 505
If it's a 7-hour flight or a 45-minute drive
In my imagination you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs

Stop and wait a sec
Oh when you look at me like that my darling
What did you expect?
I'd probably still adore you with your hands around my neck
Or I did last time I checked

Not shy of a spark
A knife twists at the thought that I should fall short of the mark
Frightened by the bite though it's no harsher than the bark
Middle of adventure, such a perfect place to start

I'm going back to 505
If it's a 7-hour flight or a 45-minute drive
In my imagination you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs

But I crumble completely when you cry
It seems like once again you've had to greet me with "Goodbye"
I'm always just about to go and spoil a surprise
Take my hands off of your eyes too soon

I'm going back to 505
If it's a 7-hour flight or a 45-minute drive
In my imagination you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs

...and a smile
---------------------------------------------------
Psychic spies from China try to steal your mind's elation
And little girls from Sweden dream of silver-screen quotation
And if you want these kind of dreams, it's Californication

It's the edge of the world and all of Western civilization
The sun may rise in the East, at least it settled in a final location
It's understood that Hollywood sells Californication

Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
Celebrity skin: is this your chin or is that war you're waging?

First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn

Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

Marry me, girl, be my fairy to the world, be my very own constellation
A teenage bride with a baby inside getting high on information
And buy me a star on the boulevard, it's Californication

Space may be the final frontier but it's made in a Hollywood basement
And Cobain, can you hear the spheres singing songs off Station to Station?
And Alderaan's not far away, it's Californication

Born and raised by those who praise control of population
Well, everybody's been there, and I don't mean no vacation

First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn

Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

Destruction leads to a very rough road but it also breeds creation
And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar, they're just another good vibration
And tidal waves couldn't save the world from Californication

Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
Sicker than the rest, there is no test, but this is what you're craving

First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn

Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
---------------------------------------------------
You get a shiver in the dark
It's raining in the park, but meantime
South of the river, you stop, and you hold everything
A band is blowing Dixie, double-four time
You feel alright when you hear the music ring

Well, now you step inside
But you don't see too many faces
Coming in out of the rain to hear the jazz go down
Competition in other places
Ah, but the horns, they're blowing that sound
Way on down south
Way on down south, London town

Check out guitar George
He knows all the chords
Mind, it's strictly rhythm
He doesn't wanna make it cry or sing
Yes and an old guitar is all he can afford
When he gets up under the lights to play his thing

And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene
He's got a daytime job, he's doing alright
He can play the honky tonk like anything
Saving it up for Friday night
With the Sultans
With the Sultans of Swing
Yeah

And a crowd of young boys
They're fooling around in the corner
Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies
And their platform soles
They don't give a damn
About any trumpet-playing band
It ain't what they call "Rock and Roll"
And the Sultans
Yeah, the Sultans, they play Creole
Creole

And then the man, he steps right up to the microphone
And says at last, just as the time bell rings
"Goodnight, now it's time to go home"
Then he makes it fast with one more thing
"We are the Sultans
We are the Sultans of Swing"
---------------------------------------------------
I get up in the evening
And I ain't got nothing to say
I come home in the morning
I go to bed feeling the same way
I ain't nothing but tired
Man, I'm just tired and bored with myself
Hey there baby, I could use just a little help

You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

Message keeps getting clearer
Radio's on and I'm moving 'round the place
I check my look in the mirror
I wanna change my clothes, my hair, my face
Man, I ain't getting nowhere
I'm just living in a dump like this
There's something happening somewhere
Baby, I just know that there is

You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

You sit around getting older
There's a joke here somewhere and it's on me
I'll shake this world off my shoulders
Come on, baby, the laugh's on me

Stay on the streets of this town
And they'll be carving you up all right
They say you gotta stay hungry
Hey, baby, I'm just about starving tonight
I'm dying for some action
I'm sick of sitting 'round here trying to write this book
I need a love reaction
Come on now, baby, gimme just one look

You can't start a fire
Sitting 'round crying over a broken heart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
You can't start a fire
Worrying about your little world falling apart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Hey, baby
---------------------------------------------------
Yeah, nigga, we're still fucking with you
Still waters run deep
Still Snoop Dogg and D.R.E
'99, nigga, guess who's back
Still, still doing that shit, huh, Dre?
Oh for sure
Yeah
Check me out

It's still Dre Day nigga, AK nigga
Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
'Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How? Nigga, my last album was The Chronic (Nigga)
They wanna know if he still got it
They say rap's changed, they wanna know how I feel about it
(If you ain't up on things)
Dr. Dre is the name, I'm ahead of my game
Still puffing my leaves, still fuck with the beats
Still not loving police (Huh-uh)
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease (For sure)
Still got love for the streets, repping 213 (For life)
Still the beats bang, still doing my thing
Since I left ain't too much changed, still

I'm representing for them gangsters all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E
I'm representing for them gangsters all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E

Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends
Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dipping again
Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
He's triple platinum, doing 50 a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat rap like Cali weed: I smoke 'til I'm 'sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire 'til you're soaking in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
Since "Turn Out the Lights" from the World Class Wrecking Crew
I'm still at it, after mathematics
In the home of drive-bys and ak-matics
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic
I dip through, then I give you (Still) D.R.E

I'm representing for them gangsters all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E
I'm representing for them gangsters all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E

It ain't nothing but more hot shit
Another classic CD for y'all to vibe with
Whether you're cooling on the corner with your fly bitch (Bitch)
Laid-back in the shack, play this track
I'm representing for the gangsters all across the world
Still (Hitting them corners in them low-lows, girl)
I'll break your neck, damn near put your face in your lap
Niggas try to be the king, but the ace is back
(So if you ain't up on things)
Dr. Dre be the name (What?), still running the game
Still got it wrapped like a mummy
Still ain't tripping, love to see young blacks get money
Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood
Hit my boys off with jobs, no more living hard (Nah, nah)
Barbeques every day, driving fancy cars (Hey, hey)
Still gon' get mine regardless (Still)

I'm representing for them gangsters all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E
I'm representing for them gangsters all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E
I'm representing for them gangsters all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E

Right back up in your motherfucking ass
9-5 plus four pennies, add that shit up
D.R.E. right back up on top of things
Smoke some with your Dogg
No stress, no seeds, no stems, no sticks!
Some of that real sticky-icky-icky
Ooh wee! Put it in the air!
Well, you's a fool, D-R, ha-ha
---------------------------------------------------
Jump in that (Huh, huh), summon that bitch
Jump in that (Huh, huh), jump in that fire, jump in that bitch
Hittin' that fire, jump in that whip, thumbin' that bitch
Cum in that bitch (Ho), drummin' that (Huh, huh)
Drummin' that bitch (Yeah)

Chopper doin' circles, it's a Vert', Vert'
Take him to the party, he's a nerd (Pop out)
I see niggas hit corners in the motherfuckin' 'burbs, huh (Pop out)
Done politickin' with the competition, what's the word? (Yeah)
Put that on my mama, nigga, eight in the process
Niggas tryna tippy-toe through the progress
Tongue-tied when the truth is an object
What's the pros and the cons of this next check?
Wasn't nobody 'round, I was independent
In the 90s, sittin' bum with the windows tinted
Heard a bum got a strap in the party
Who the fuck lays out niggas at the party?
Beat 'em up, beat 'em up, beat 'em up, beat 'em up (Ah)
I was seein' double in the projects
Mad at myself when I put it to the side
Mama had to cater for the coupe
That we rode after school on the way to Popeyes
And niggas wanna play both sides
It's a red dot, don't get on the wrong red eye
It's a headshot, Damien Kane, Woo
Them guys
Fuck around and bury two of them guys
I'm OD in Paris, I'm OD in France
I thought that I told you, I need the advance
Put down your IG and look through my lens
A million to grandma, who did I offend?
The girl of your dreams to me is a fan
I netted ten million and did a lil' dance
I'm fuckin' the world, I unzip my pants
My uncle G told me that I had a chance
So then I popped out and did it again
And did it again and did it again
I can not respect them, where did he begin?
Advice from the council, let nobody in
Been swervin' through rumors
Avoidin' the trends and duckin' the hoes
I'm duckin' the loonies that come with the shows
I'm grateful to Man-Man, he opened up doors
And bung' on the tour bus to come and compose
I reach to the stars on my tippy toes
This greatest success where most niggas fold
I tell you my past, that shit don't get old
But how could you ask like I don't be writin' my raps?
These critics got everyone tapped
You gotta relax, the city where nobody sleep
Just tap in and ask where I'm at, ho


Smoking on your top five tonight, tonight
Yeah, I'm smokin' on your, what's her name, tonight, tonight
Smokin' on you, shores, ain't two-nine, yeah, two

I am the omega, pgLang, Rollie gang, SIE
Don't you address me unless it's with four letters
I thought you'd known better

Hold on, y'all niggas playin' with me, man

I'm not a trending topic, I'm a prophet
I answer to Metatron and Gabriel
Bitch, looking for a better me

The Al Green offspring, guns and the melody
The big shot, wrist on cryotherapy
Soon as I press that button
Nigga better get right like the ambulance comin'

Dave Free got at least one B in the oven
I'm trippin', I'm juugin', my mental is amazing, brother

Rich nigga, momma know I made it, brother

New flows comin', be patient, brother

2021, I ain't takin' no prisoner
Last year, y'all fucked up all the listener
Who went platinum? I call that a visitor
Who the fuck backin' 'em? All been falsified
The facts mean this a vaccine, and the game need me to survive
The Elohim, the rebirth
Before you get to the Father, you gotta holla at me first, bitch
Smokin' on top fives
Motherfuck that album, fuck that single
Burn that hard drive (Burn that shit)
Ain't nobody safe
When I come up killin' everybody that's outside (Who you with?)
Yeah, Kanye changed his life
But me, I'm still an old school Gemini (Lil' bitch)
Let me jump in this bitch


Let me jump in this bitch
Two phones, but I only bring one in this bitch

One daughter, but they all my sons in this bitch

No hoes, ain't shit gettin' done in this bitch

I'm scary, I got a gun in this bitch
Smokin' on top fives, stop playin', I'm that guy

Number two DM'ing my bitch
That's cool, I don't ask why
---------------------------------------------------
This night is cold in the kingdom
I can feel you fade away
From the kitchen to the bathroom sink and
Your steps keep me awake

Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
I once was a man with dignity and grace
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
So please, please

Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me

If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly

Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down
Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down

If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly

Cold skin, drag my feet on the tile
As I'm walking down the corridor
And I know we haven't talked in a while
So I'm looking for an open door

Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
I once was a man with dignity and grace
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
So please, please

Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me

If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly

Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down
Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down

If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly

And I can't stop myself from falling down
And I can't stop myself from falling down
And I can't stop myself from falling down
And I can't stop myself from falling down

Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me

If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly

Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down
Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down

If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly

If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly
---------------------------------------------------
Yeah, this one right here goes out
To all the baby's mamas' mamas
Mamas, mamas, baby mamas' mamas
Yeah, go like this

I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times


My baby's drama mama don't like me
She be doin' things like havin' them boys
Come from her neighborhood to the studio, tryna fight me
She needs to get a piece of the American pie and take her bite out
That's my house, I'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby and not a pay check
Private school, daycare, shit, medical billsI pay that
I love your mom and everything
But see, I ain't the only one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war
My lawyers stay down
She never got a chance to hear my side of the story
We was divided
She had fish fries, cookouts for my child's birthday, I ain't invited
Despite it I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah


I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

Me and your daughter got a special thang goin' on
You say it's puppy love; we say it's full-grown (Arroof)
Hope that we feel this, feel this way forever
You can plan a pretty picnic but you can't predict the weather
Ms. Jackson

Ten times out of nine, now if I'm lyin', find
The quickest muzzle, throw it on my mouth and I'll decline
King meets queen, then the puppy love thing
Together dream 'bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
On the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever ever? Forever, ever?
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day-by-day ruler can't be too wrong
Ms. Jackson, my intentions were good, I wish I could
Become a magician to abracadabra all the sadder
Thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Asking what happened to the feeling that her and me had
I pray so much about it, need some knee pads
It happened for a reason, one can't be mad
So know this, know that everything's cool
And yes, I will be present on the first day of school and graduation

I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times


"Look at the way he treats me"
Shit, look at the way you treat me
You see, your little nosy-ass homegirls
Done got your ass sent up the creek, G
Without a paddle, you left to straddle and ride this thing on out
Now you and your girl ain't speakin' no more
'Cause my dick all in her mouth
Know what I'm talkin' about?
Jealousy, infidelity, envy, cheating, beating
In the year 2G, they be the same thing
So who you placin' the blame on?
You keep on singin' the same song; let bygones be bygones
And you can go on and get the hell on, you and your mama


I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
---------------------------------------------------
On a cobweb afternoon in a room full of emptiness
By a freeway, I confess I was lost in the pages
Of a book full of death, reading how we'll die alone
And if we're good, we'll lay to rest anywhere we want to go

In your house I long to be
Room by room patiently
I'll wait for you there like a stone
I'll wait for you there alone

And on my deathbed I will pray to the gods and the angels
Like a pagan to anyone who will take me to heaven
To a place I recall, I was there so long ago
The sky was bruised, the wine was bled, and there you led me on

In your house I long to be
Room by room, patiently
I'll wait for you there like a stone
I'll wait for you there alone, alone

And on I read until the day was gone
And I sat in regret of all the things I've done
For all that I've blessed, and all that I've wronged
In dreams until my death I will wander on

In your house I long to be
Room by room, patiently
I'll wait for you there like a stone
I'll wait for you there alone, alone
---------------------------------------------------
Don't blame me
Love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right
Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life

I've been breaking hearts a long time
And toying with them older guys
Just playthings for me to use
Something happened for the first time
In the darkest little paradise
Shaking, pacing, I just need you

For you
I would cross the line
I would waste my time
I would lose my mind
They say, "She's gone too far this time."

Don't blame me
Love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right
Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life

Don't blame me
Love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right
Oh, Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life

My name is whatever you decide
And I'm just gonna call you mine
I'm insane, but I'm your baby (your baby)
Echoes (echoes) of your name inside my mind
Halo, hiding my obsession
I once was poison ivy, but now I'm your daisy

And, baby, for you
I would fall from grace
Just to touch your face
If you walk away
I'd beg you on my knees to stay

Don't blame me
Love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right
Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life

Don't blame me
Love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right
Oh, Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life

I get so high, oh
Every time you'reevery time you're loving me
You're loving me
Trip of my life, oh
Every time you'reevery time you're touching me
You're touching me

Every time you'reevery time you're loving me

Oh, Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life
(Using for the rest of my life. Oh!)

Don't blame me
Love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right (doing it right, no)
Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life

Don't blame me
Love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right (you ain't doing it...)
Oh, Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life (I'll be using, I'll be using)

I get so high, oh
Every time you'reevery time you're loving me
You're loving me
Oh, Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life

Hmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm

Let it ring
Hmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
(Let me talk to 'em)
Come on


Shawty had them Apple Bottom jeans (Jeans), boots with the fur (With the fur)
The whole club was lookin' at her
She hit the flo' (She hit the flo'), next thing you know
Shawty got low-low-low-low-low-low-low-low
Them baggy sweat pants and the Reeboks with the straps (With the straps)
She turned around and gave that big booty a smack (Ayy!)
She hit the flo' (She hit the flo'), next thing you know
Shawty got low-low-low-low-low-low-low-low


Hey, I ain't never seen nothin' that'll make me go
This crazy all night spendin' my dough
Had a million dollar vibe and a bottle to go
Them birthday cakes they stole the show
So sexual, she was flexible
Professional, drinkin' X and O
Hold up, wait a minute, do I see what I think I, whoa
Did I think I see shawty get low?
Ain't the same when it's up that close
Make it rain, I'm makin' it snow
Work the pole, I got the bank roll
I'ma say that I prefer them no clothes
I'm into that, I love women exposed
She threw it back at me, I gave her mo'
Cash ain't no problem, I know where it goes
She had them


Apple Bottom jeans (Jeans), boots with the fur (With the fur)
The whole club was lookin' at her
She hit the flo' (She hit the flo'), next thing you know
Shawty got low-low-low-low-low-low-low-low
Them baggy sweat pants and the Reeboks with the straps (With the straps)
She turned around and gave that big booty a smack (Ayy!)
She hit the flo' (She hit the flo'), next thing you know
Shawty got low-low-low-low-low-low-low-low


Hey, shawty, what I gotta do to get you home?
My jeans full of guap and they ready for shones
Cadillacs, Maybachs for the sexy groan
Patron on the rocks that'll make you moan
One stack c'mon, two stacks c'mon
Three stacks c'mon, now that's three grand
What, you think I'm playin', baby girl?
I'm the man, I invented rubber bands
That's what I told her, her legs on my shoulder
I knew it was over, that Henny and Cola
Got me like a soldier, she ready for Rover
I couldn't control her
So lucky oh me, I was just like a clover
Shawty was hot like a toaster
Sorry but I had to fold her
Like a pornography poster, she showed her


Apple Bottom jeans (Jeans), boots with the fur (With the fur)
The whole club was lookin' at her
She hit the flo' (She hit the flo'), next thing you know
Shawty got low-low-low-low-low-low-low-low
Them baggy sweat pants and the Reeboks with the straps (With the straps)
She turned around and gave that big booty a smack (Ayy!)
She hit the flo' (She hit the flo'), next thing you know
Shawty got low-low-low-low-low-low-low-low


Whoa, shawty
Yeah she was worth the money
Lil' mama took my cash
And I ain't want it back
The way she bent that back
Got her them paper stacks
Tattoo above her crack
I had to handle that
I was on it, sexy woman
Let me showin' and made me want it
Two in the mornin', I'm zonin'
And them Rosay bottles foamin'
She wouldn't stop, made it drop
Shawty did that pop and lock
Had to break her off that guap
Gal was fly just like my Glock


Apple Bottom jeans (Jeans), boots with the fur (With the fur)
The whole club was lookin' at her
She hit the flo' (She hit the flo'), next thing you know
Shawty got low-low-low-low-low-low-low-low
Them baggy sweat pants and the Reeboks with the straps (With the straps)
She turned around and gave that big booty a smack (Ayy!)
She hit the flo' (She hit the flo'), next thing you know
Shawty got low-low-low-low-low-low-low-low (Come on)
---------------------------------------------------
Run fast from my day job
Runnin' fast from the way it was
Jump quick to a pay check
Runnin' back to the strip club
I'm never goin' back, never goin' back
No, you can't make me
Never goin' back, never goin' back (Nah)
They'll never take me
I've paid enough of petty dues
I've heard enough of shitty news
I've had a thing for dirty shoes since I was 10
Love dirty men alike

Ooh
Better day than yesterday (Keep cuttin' up)
Ooh oh
I just take it day by day
Ooh oh oh
Never hearing what they say (Uh)
Ooh ooh (Mm)
I just do it my way

All I got is these broken clocks
I ain't got no time
Just burnin' daylight
Still love, and it's still love, and it's still love
It's still love, still love (Still love), still love
It's still love, it's still love
Nothin' but love for you (Nothin' but-)
Nothin' but love (Nothin' but-)
Nothin' but love

All that I've got, pieces and pages
Talkin' a lot, sorry I'm faded
(Turnin' up real good tonight)
Think I forgot
(Think I forgot the other night)
You love me, you love me, you love me

Got a shift at 10 AM (Yeah)
Gotta dip at 10 PM (Nah)
Gotta get that cash
Won't get past a lunch break
I ain't had a smoke break
In about two days, don't break (Ugh)
Been about three years since I dated you
Why you still talkin' 'bout me like we together?
I moved on for the better, you moved on to whoever
I was down for whatever, and then some
You gon' make me late to work again

Ooh
Better day than yesterday
Ooh
I just take it day by day
Ooh oh oh
Never hearing what they say
Ooh, ooh
I just do it my way (Keep doin' it)

All I got is these broken clocks
I ain't got no time
Just burnin' daylight
Still love, and it's still love, and it's still love
It's still love, still love, still love (Still love)
It's still love, and it's still love (Still love)
Nothin' but love for you
Nothin' but love (Nothin' but)
Nothin' but love

I don't eat, can't sleep past 9 AM (Uh)
Heartbeat make me feel young again (Like a, feel like a...)
Can't beat 'em, just join the party (Let me join the party)
I don't wanna, don't need nobody (Ooh)

All that I've got, pieces and pages
Talking a lot, sorry I'm faded
Think I've forgot, you love me
You love me, you love me

You love me
You love me
You love me
---------------------------------------------------
I fell by the wayside like everyone else
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you
But I was just kidding myself
Our every moment, I start to replace
'Cause now that they're gone
All I hear are the words that I needed to say

When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal but this won't

So, before you go
Was there something I could've said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go

Was never the right time whenever you called
Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all
Our every moment, I start to replay
But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face

When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal but this won't

So, before you go
Was there something I could've said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go

Would we be better off by now
If I'd have let my walls come down
Maybe I guess we'll never know
You know
You know

Before you go
Was there something I could've said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go
---------------------------------------------------
Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel like my only friend
Is the city I live in, The City of Angels
Lonely as I am together we cry

I drive on her streets 'cause she's my companion
I walk through her hills 'cause she knows who I am
She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy
Well, I never worry, now that is a lie

I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love, take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love take me all the way

Yeah, yeah yeah

It's hard to believe that there's nobody out there
It's hard to believe that I'm all alone
At least I have her love
The city, she loves me
Lonely as I am together we cry

I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love take me all the way

Yeah, yeah yeah
Oh, no, no, no, yeah yeah
Love me, I say, yeah yeah
One time

(Under the bridge downtown)
Is where I drew some blood
(Under the bridge downtown)
I could not get enough
(Under the bridge downtown)
Forgot about my love
(Under the bridge downtown)
I gave my life away, yeah
Yeah yeah
Oh, no, no no no, yeah yeah
Oh no, I said oh, yeah yeah
Here I stay
---------------------------------------------------
You must think that I'm stupid
You must think that I'm a fool
You must think that I'm new to this
But I have seen this all before

I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true

I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)

I know you're thinking I'm heartless
I know you're thinking I'm cold
I'm just protecting my innocence
I'm just protecting my soul

I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true

I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
No way that you'll see me cry
(No way that you'll see me cry)

I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
No
No, no, no, no, no
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
No, no, no, no
No, no, no
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
(No way that you'll see me cry)
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)

'Cause every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true
I'm way too good at goodbyes

Sabemos lo tuyo
Rudeboyz

Ayer me besaste y no podias parar
Y me bailaste hasta el amanecer
Cuando desperte yo te quise llamar
Y ahora me dice que borro cassette

Que no se acuerda de esa noche
Porque ella borro cassette
Dice que no me conoce
Y quiero volverla a ver

Y que los tragos, hicieron estrago' en su cabeza
Ella con cualquiera no se besa
Quiero que sepa que me interesa
Y no hay un dia que no pare de pensar en su belleza

Y que los tragos, hicieron estrago' en su cabeza
Ella con cualquiera no se besa
Quiero que sepa que me interesa
Y no hay un dia que no pare de pensar en su belleza

Te dije mami, tomate un trago
Y cuando te emborrache' pa' mi casa nos vamos
Me sorprendio cuando sacaste ese cigarro
Tomaste tanto que lo has olvidado

Y tranquila ma', no pasa na'
Enloqueciste pero mas na'
Pedias a grito que te besara
En la escalera y en el sofa
Y tranquila ma', no pasa na'
Conozco ya tu debilidad
Bastara solo un par de copas
Pa' conocerte en la intimidad

Y tu, mami, como dices que no te acuerdas?
Como mi cuerpo te calienta
Ven, dimelo en la cara y no mientas
Dejemos de jugar

Y tu, mami, como dices que no te acuerdas?
Como mi cuerpo te calienta
Ven, dimelo en la cara y no mientas
Dejemos de jugar

Ayer me besaste y no podias parar
Y me bailaste hasta el amanecer
Cuando desperte yo te quise llamar
Ahora me dice que borro cassette

Que no se acuerda de esa noche
Porque ella borro cassette
Dice que no me conoce
Y quiero volverla a ver

Y que los tragos, hicieron estrago' en su cabeza
Ella con cualquiera no se besa
Quiero que sepa que me interesa
Y no hay un dia que no pare de pensar en su belleza

Y que los tragos, hicieron estrago' en su cabeza
Ella con cualquiera no se besa
Quiero que sepa que me interesa
Y no hay un dia que no pare de pensar en su belleza

Te estoy buscando para ver si los repetimos
Esa noche, que bien lo hicimos
Entre tragos nos desvestimos
Las botellas que nos tomamos
A la locura que nos llevaron
Fue mucho lo que vacilamos
Imposible no recordarlo

Y tu, mami, como dices que no te acuerdas?
Como mi cuerpo te calienta
Ven, dimelo en la cara y no mientas
Dejemos de jugar

Y tu, mami, como dices que no te acuerdas?
Como mi cuerpo te calienta
Ven, dimelo en la cara y no mientas
Dejemos de jugar

Yeah, I'm out that Brooklyn, now I'm down in Tribeca
Right next to De Niro, but I'll be hood forever
I'm the new Sinatra, and since I made it here
I can make it anywhere, yeah, they love me everywhere
I used to cop in Harlem  hola, my Dominicanos (Dinero!)
Right there up on Broadway, brought me back to that McDonald's
Took it to my stash spot, 560 State Street
Catch me in the kitchen, like a Simmons whipping pastry
Cruising down 8th Street, off-white Lexus
Driving so slow, but BK is from Texas
Me? I'm out that Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie
Now I live on Billboard and I brought my boys with me
Say what up to Ty Ty, still sipping Mai Tais
Sitting courtside, Knicks and Nets give me high fives
Nigga, I be spiked out, I could trip a referee
Tell by my attitude that I'm most definitely from

In New York (Ay, aha) (Uh, yeah)
Concrete jungle (Yeah) where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do (Yeah) (OK)
Now you're in New York (Aha, aha, aha) (Uh, yeah)
These streets will make you feel brand-new (New)
Big lights will inspire you (Come on) (OK)
Let's hear it for New York (You welcome, OG) (Uh)
New York (Yeah), New York (Uh) (I made you hot, nigga)

Catch me at the X with OG at a Yankee game
Shit, I made the Yankee hat more famous than a Yankee can
You should know I bleed blue, but I ain't a Crip though
But I got a gang of niggas walking with my clique though
Welcome to the melting pot, corners where we're selling rock
Africa Bambaataa shit, home of the hip-hop
Yellow cab, gypsy cab, dollar cab, holler back
For foreigners, it ain't fair, they act like they forgot how to add
Eight million stories out there in the naked
City, it's a pity half of y'all won't make it
Me? I gotta plug Special Ed, "I Got It Made"
If Jeezy's paying LeBron, I'm paying Dwyane Wade
Three dice cee-lo, three-card Marley
Labor Day Paraderest in peace, Bob Marley
Statue of Liberty, long live the World Trade
Long live the king, yoI'm from the Empire State, that's

In New York (Ay) (Uh, yeah)
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do (That boy good) (OK)
Now you're in New York (Welcome to the bright lights, baby) (Uh, yeah)
These streets will make you feel brand-new
Big lights will inspire you (OK)
Let's hear it for New York (Uh)
New York (Yeah), New York (Uh)

Lights is blinding, girls need blinders
So they can step out of bounds quick, the side lines is
Lined with casualties who sip the life casually
Then gradually become worse  don't bite the apple, Eve!
Caught up in the in-crowd, now you're in-style
Into the winter gets cold, en vogue with your skin out
City of sin is a pity on a whim
Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them
Mami, took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
"Hail Mary" to the city, you're a virgin
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church end
Came here for school, graduated to the high life
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
MDMA got you feeling like a champion
The city never sleeps, better slip you're a Ambien

In New York (Ay, ow) (Uh, yeah)
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do (OK)
Now you're in New York (Uh, yeah)

Street lights, big dreams, all looking pretty (Oh)
No place in the world that could compare (Nah)
Put your lighters in the air, everybody say
"Yeah, yeah" (Come on, come on)
"Yeah, yeah" (Come on)

In New York (Uh, yeah)
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of

---------------------------------------------------
Ugh, you're a monster

I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I'll feel like Godzilla
Better hit the deck like the card dealer
My whole squad's in here, walking around the party
A cross between a zombie apocalypse and B-Bobby "The
Brain" Heenan which is probably the
Same reason I wrestle with mania
Shady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up
Consider it to cross me a costly mistake
If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia
ADHD, Hydroxycut
Pass the Courvoisier (Hey, hey)
In AA with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate
Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday (Ayy)
This beat is cray-cray, Ray J, H-A-H-A-H-A
Laughing all the way to the bank, I spray flames
They cannot tame or placate the

Monster
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet

I'm just a product of Slick Rick and Onyx, told 'em lick the balls
Had 'em just appalled, did so many things that pissed 'em off
It's impossible to list 'em all
And in the midst of all this
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal, voices whisper
My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on a guy with a missile launcher
I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological
Quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of vodka
When you twist the top of the bottle, I'm a

Monster
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet

If you never gave a damn (Ayy), raise your hand
'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans
I'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is
The motherfuckin' finger (Finger), prostate exam ('Xam)
How can I have all these fans and perspire?
Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flyer
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers
And what goes around comes around just like the blades on the chainsaw
'Cause I caught the flack, but my dollars stacked right off the bat like a baseball
Like Kid Ink, bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy
'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake, yeah)
Bitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher
Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her
Face in my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez
Cristhian Rivera, 'cause my lyrics never sit well
So they wanna give me the chair
Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Hari Kari
'Cause e'ry Tom and Dick and Harry carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary on 'em
Swearing up and down they can spit, this shit's hilarious
It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column
We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem
Get the shaft like a steering column (Monster)
Trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink
Evil half of the Bad Meets
Evil, that means take a back seat
Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi single
Look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people
Is my 'Gangsta Bitch' like Apache with a catchy jingle
I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em
Other words, I Minute Maid 'em
I don't wanna hurt 'em, but I did, I'm in a fit of rage
I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade
I'm finna kill 'em and dump all their fuckin' bodies in the lake
Obliterating everything, incinerate a renegade
I'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill
I'm Attila, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla
You're bringin' the killer within me outta me
You don't wanna be the enemy of the demon who entered me
And be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be
Every bit of me's the epitome of a spitter
When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck
Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me
A hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me
I'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you, bitch, I'm unfadable
You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowin' up like an inflatable
I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable
I'm on the toilet bowl, I got a trailer full of money and I'm paid in full
I'm not afraid to pull a

Man, stop
Look what I'm plannin', haha
---------------------------------------------------
Her day starts with a coffee
And ends with a wine.
Takes forever getting ready.
So, she's never on time
For anything.

When she gets that come-get-me
Look in her eyes,
Well, it kinda scares me
The way that she drives
Me wild.
But she drives me wild.

Beautiful, crazy.
She can't help but amaze me.
The way that she dances,
Ain't afraid to take chances.
And wears her heart on her sleeve.
Yeah, she's crazy,
But her crazy is beautiful to me.

She makes plans for the weekend,
Can't wait to go out
'Til she changes her mind.
Says, "Let's stay on the couch
And watch TV."
And she falls asleep.

Beautiful, crazy.
She can't help but amaze me.
The way that she dances,
Ain't afraid to take chances.
And wears her heart on her sleeve.
Yeah, she's crazy,
But her crazy is beautiful to me.

She's unpredictable, unforgettable.
It's unusual, unbelievable.
How I'm such a fool!
Yeah, I'm such a fool for her.

Beautiful, crazy.
She can't help but amaze me.
The way that she dances,
Ain't afraid to take chances.
And wears her heart on her sleeve.
Yeah, she's crazy.
She's crazy.
She's crazy,
But her crazy is beautiful to me.
Her crazy is beautiful to me.

Oh, baby, baby

That something wasn't right here?
Oh, baby, baby

And now you're out of sight, yeah

Show me how you want it to be
Tell me, baby
'Cause I need to know now, oh, because

My loneliness
Is killing me and I
I must confess
I still believe, still believe
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time

Oh, baby, baby
The reason I breathe is you
Boy, you got me blinded
Oh, pretty baby
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
It's not the way I planned it

And give me a sign?
Hit me, baby, one more time

---------------------------------------------------
Aren't you somethin' to admire?
'Cause your shine is somethin' like a mirror
And I can't help but notice
You reflect in this heart of mine
If you ever feel alone and
The glare makes me hard to find
Just know that I'm always parallel on the other side

'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass
I'm here tryin' to pull you through
You just gotta be strong

'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along

It's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me
I couldn't get any bigger
With anyone else beside of me
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me

Aren't you somethin', an original
'Cause it doesn't seem merely a sample
And I can't help but stare, 'cause
I see truth somewhere in your eyes
I can't ever change without you
You reflect me, I love that about you
And if I could, I would look at us all the time

'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass
I'm here tryin' to pull you through
You just gotta be strong

'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along

It's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me
I couldn't get any bigger
With anyone else beside of me
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me

Yesterday is history
Tomorrow's a mystery
I can see you lookin' back at me
Keep your eyes on me
Baby, keep your eyes on me

'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now (please show me, baby)
I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along

It's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me
I couldn't get any bigger
With anyone else beside of me
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me

You are, you are the love of my life

Now you're the inspiration of this precious song
And I just wanna see your face light up since you put me on
So now I say goodbye to the old me, it's already gone
And I can't wait wait wait wait wait to get you home
Just to let you know, you are

You are, you are the love of my life

Girl you're my reflection, all I see is you
My reflection, in everything I do
You're my reflection and all I see is you
My reflection, in everything I do

You are, you are the love of my life
---------------------------------------------------

I got power, poison, pain and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle though, ambition, flow, inside my DNA
I was born like this, since one like this
Immaculate conception
I transform like this, perform like this
Was Yeshua's new weapon
I don't contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head
This that put-the-kids-to-bed
This that I got, I got, I got, I got
Realness, I just kill shit 'cause it's in my DNA
I got millions, I got riches buildin' in my DNA
I got dark, I got evil, that rot inside my DNA
I got off, I got troublesome, heart inside my DNA
I just win again, then win again like Wimbledon, I serve
Yeah, that's him again, the sound that engine in is like a bird
You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard
I know how you work, I know just who you are
See, you's a, you's a, you's a-
Bitch, your hormones probably switch inside your DNA
Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA
Daddy probably snitched, heritage inside your DNA
Backbone don't exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge
See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front
Shit I've been through probably offend you
This is Paula's oldest son
I know murder, conviction
Burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead, redemption
Scholars, fathers dead with kids
And I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier's DNA (I'm a soldier's DNA)
Born inside the beast
My expertise checked out in second grade
When I was 9, on-cell motel, we didn't have nowhere to stay
At 29, I've done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I'm supposed to
Antisocial, extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And Nazareth gonna plead his case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet say

This is why I say that hip-hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years

Tell me somethin'
You motherfuckers can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you're in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy and walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows, I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder-these are the breaks
These are the times, level number 9
Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murder-our DNA


DNA
Gimme some ganja, gimme some ganja

Soliamos escondernos siempre en la oscuridad
Guardo bajo llave mil historias mas
La luna llena nos alumbra cuando hay que pecar
Para vernos las caras con mas claridad


Claro como agua
Si te vas me da toda la magua
Te hago canciones pa' nada
La peor decision hoy fue esta llamada
Tengo el run-run-run, mija
Quien quieres ser?
Conmigo sal del papel
Dices que me quieres pero solo quieres gastar y coger otra vez

Hey, claro como agua
Si te vas me da toda la magua
Te hago canciones pa' nada
La peor decision hoy fue esta llamada
Tengo el run-run-run, chacha
Quien quieres ser?
Conmigo sal del papel
Dices que me quieres pero solo quieres gastar y coger

Mi cruz es que al alba te vas a marchar
3,2, 1


Soliamos escondernos siempre en la oscuridad
Guardo bajo llave mil historias mas
La luna llena nos alumbra cuando hay que pecar
Para vernos las caras con mas claridad


Me encontre
Y asi fue como te perdi
O al menos es la excusa que me di
Pa' justificar dejarte ir
Despues, de aquel dilema me fui
Tus captions empezaron a ser por el
Y dejaron de hablar de mi
En retrospectiva
Pudimos y no hicimos nada
Ahora estoy con to's mis panas
Intento olvidarte gata
Bebiendo oyendo Tropicana, na' mas
(Pull up)
Descanse en paz DJ Cava

Mi cruz es que al alba te vas a marchar
(Te vas a marchar)


Soliamos escondernos siempre en la oscuridad
Guardo bajo llave mil historias mas
La luna llena nos alumbra cuando hay que pecar
Para vernos las caras con mas claridad

Me perdi'o de ti, dejame sentir
(Llamame cuando te de por llorar por mi)
Quiero ser palabra, volver a empezar por mi
(Llamame cuando te de por llorar por mi)
Odiame. Buscame. Los fallos en aumento
(Llamame cuando te de por llorar por mi)
Mi cruz es que al alba te vas a marchar
(Llamame cuando te de por llorar por mi)

Listen, baby
Ain't no mountain high
Ain't no valley low
Ain't no river wide enough, baby

If you need me, call me
No matter where you are
No matter how far (don't worry, baby)
Just call my name
I'll be there in a hurry
You don't have to worry
Cause baby there

Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you, babe

Remember the day
I set you free
I told you you could always count on me, darling
From that day on, I made a vow
I'll be there when you want me
Some way, some how
Cause baby there

Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you, babe

Oh no, darling

No wind, no rain
Nor winter's cold
Can't stop me baby

No no baby

Cause you are my goal

If you're ever in trouble
I'll be there on the double
Just send for me

Oh baby!

My love is alive
Way down in my heart
Although we are miles apart

If you ever need a helping hand
I'll be there on the double
Just as fast as I can

Don't you know that there...

Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you babe

Don't you know that there...

Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
---------------------------------------------------
Ten out of ten
You killed it once again
Cause you're doing fine
This is to show you
Just how much we need you in our lives

This place wouldn't be the same without you
You could say that it would be a little worse
There's just something about you
With you it is all more worth

Oh, never did a woman do so much to me
Oh, you've got some kind of hold on me
All the things that you do
You do it all so gracefully
Oh, never did a woman do so much to me

Can we just stop?
It's our time to learn yourself to praise you
Cause we do it wrong
And you make it right
You bring the balance to our lives, you've done it all alone

This place wouldn't be the same without you
You can say that it had been a whole lot worse
Cause there's just something about you
And with you it is all more worth

Never did a woman do so much to me
Oh, you've got some kind of hold on me
All the things that you do
You do it all so gracefully
Oh, never did a woman do so much to me

And I thought I should tell you
How loved you are
How loved you are
Just how loved you are
And if we are together
Oh, we're going far
We're going far
We're going far

And I thought I should tell you
How loved you are
How loved you are
Just how loved you are
And if we are together
We're going far
We're going far
We're going far
---------------------------------------------------
Hello
I've waited here for you
Everlong
Tonight
I throw myself into
And out of the red
Out of her head she sang

Come down
And waste away with me
Down with me
Slow how
You wanted it to be
I'm over my head
Out of her head she sang

And I wonder
When I sing along with you
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You gotta promise not to stop when I say when she sang

Breathe out
So I can breathe you in
Hold you in
And now
I know you've always been
Out of your head
Out of my head I sang

And I wonder
When I sing along with you
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You gotta promise not to stop when I say when she sang


So, Dad would take the Sundays off.
And that's the only time he could ever get any rest.
And so, because we were loud on Sundays, he'd make us hold his construction boots over our head, 'til we'd sleep.
And they were really heavy boots and I used to say, "Dad, come on, please."
And like start crying, 'cause they're too heavy.

And I wonder
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when

I would have walked through fire to kiss your lips
Do you still think about it, of what you did?
Still see your old apartment, like a bad trip
Wish I could forget all the places we've been

Hard and heavy whiskey goodbyes
Boy, you know how to make a girl cry
Was sleeping in a bed full of lies
And now that I'm older, I can see why

You make me feel high
'Cause you had me so low, low, low
You only seemed tall
'Cause you stunted my growth, growth, growth
I only wanted you 'cause I couldn't have you
Now that I know
That wasn't love, that wasn't love, that was just hope

That wasn't love, that wasn't love, that was just hope

Always another bender, I lose control
I thought I'd get it back when
You came back home to me, darling
But I never had it, did I? Your heart's a trick
And all the magic we felt was just a hit

Hard and heavy whiskey goodbyes
Boy, you know how to make a girl cry
Was sleeping in a bed full of lies
And now that I'm older, I can see why

You make me feel high
'Cause you had me so low, low, low
You only seemed tall
'Cause you stunted my growth, growth, growth
I only wanted you 'cause I couldn't have you
Now that I know (Now that I know)
That wasn't love, that wasn't love, that was just hope

'Cause you had me so low
Now that I know
That wasn't love, that wasn't love, that was just hope

'Cause you had me so low, low, low
You only seemed tall
'Cause you stunted my growth, growth, growth
I only wanted you 'cause I couldn't have you
Now that I know (Now that I know)
That wasn't love, that wasn't love, that was just hope

It's just one of those days
When you don't wanna wake up
Everything is fucked
Everybody sucks
You don't really know why
But you wanna justify
Rippin' someone's head off
No human contact
And if you interact
Your life is on contract
Your best bet is to stay away, motherfucker!
It's just one of those days

It's all about the he says/she says bullshit
I think you better quit lettin' shit slip
Or you'll be leavin' with a fat lip
It's all about the he says/she says bullshit
I think you better quit talkin' that shit

It's just one of those days
Feelin' like a freight train
First one to complain
Leaves with a blood stain
Damn right, I'm a maniac
You better watch your back
'Cause I'm fuckin' up your program
And if you're stuck up
You're just lucked up
Next in line to get fucked up
Your best bet is to stay away, motherfucker!
It's just one of those days

It's all about the he says/she says bullshit
I think you better quit lettin' shit slip
Or you'll be leavin' with a fat lip
It's all about the he says/she says bullshit
I think you better quit talkin' that shit
Punk, so come and get it

I feel like shit
My suggestion is to keep your distance
'Cause right now I'm dangerous
We've all felt like shit
And been treated like shit
All those motherfuckers that want to step up
I hope you know I pack a chain saw
I'll skin your ass raw
And if my day keeps goin' this way
I just might break somethin' tonight
I pack a chainsaw
I'll skin your ass raw
And if my day keeps goin' this way
I just might break somethin' tonight
I pack a chainsaw
I'll skin your ass raw
And if my day keeps goin' this way
I just might break your fuckin' face tonight

Give me somethin' to break
Give me somethin' to break
Just give me somethin' to break
How 'bout your fuckin' face?
I hope you know I pack a chainsaw (what?)
A chainsaw (what?)
A motherfuckin' chainsaw (what?)
So come and get it

It's all about the he says/she says bullshit
I think you better quit lettin' shit slip
Or you'll be leavin' with a fat lip
It's all about the he says/she says bullshit
I think you better quit talkin' that shit
Punk, so come and get it

Some folks are born made to wave the flag
Ooh, they're red, white and blue
And when the band plays "Hail To The Chief"
Ooh, they point the cannon at you, Lord

It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no senator's son, son
It ain't me, it ain't me; I ain't no fortunate one, no

Some folks are born silver spoon in hand
Lord, don't they help themselves, oh
But when the taxman come to the door
Lord, the house lookin' like a rummage sale, yeah

It ain't me, it ain't me; I ain't no fortunate one, no

Some folks inherit star-spangled eyes
Ooh, they send you down to war, Lord
And when you ask 'em, "How much should we give?"
Ooh, they only answer, "More! More! More!" Yo

It ain't me, it ain't me; I ain't no fortunate one, one

It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no fortunate one, no no no
It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no fortunate son, no no no
It ain't me, it ain't me

Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck (wreck)
Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck (wreck)

Needless to say, I'm keepin' in check
She was a bad-bad, nevertheless
Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck
Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck

Thinkin' in a bad way, losin' your grip
Screamin' at my face, baby, don't trip
Someone took a big L, don't know how that felt
Lookin' at you sideways, party on tilt

Ooh-ooh
Some things you just can't refuse
She wanna ride me like a cruise
And I'm not tryna lose

Then you're left in the dust
Unless I stuck by ya
You're a sunflower
I think your love would be too much
Or you'll be left in the dust
Unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower
You're the sunflower


Every time I'm leavin' on you
You don't make it easy, no, no
Wish I could be there for you
Give me a reason to, oh, oh

Every time I'm walkin' out
I can hear you tellin' me to turn around
Fightin' for my trust and you won't back down
Even if we gotta risk it all right now, oh

I know you're scared of the unknown (-known)
You don't wanna be alone (alone)
I know I always come and go (and go)
But it's out of my control

And you'll be left in the dust
Unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower
I think your love would be too much
Or you'll be left in the dust
Unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower
You're the sunflower
Yeah

Some people live for the fortune
Some people live just for the fame
Some people live for the power, yeah
Some people live just to play the game

Some people think that the physical things
Define what's within
And I've been there before but that life's a bore
So full of the superficial

Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, yeah

Some people search for a fountain
That promises forever young (Ya know)
Some people need three dozen roses
And that's the only way to prove you love them

Hand me the world on a silver platter
And what good would it be?
With no one to share
With no one who truly cares for me

Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, you, you
Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, yeah

If I ain't got you with me, baby
Ooh, ooh
Said nothing in this whole wide world don't mean a thing
If I ain't got you with me, baby

Uptown girl
She's been living in her uptown world
I bet she's never had a backstreet guy
I bet her mamma never told her why
I'm gonna try for an

Uptown girl
She's been living in her white-bread world
As long as anyone with hot blood can
And now, she's looking for a downtown man
That's what I am

And when she knows what she wants from her time
And when she wakes up and makes up her mind

She'll see I'm not so tough
Just because I'm in love with an

Uptown girl
You know I've seen her in her uptown world
She's getting tired of her high-class toys
And all the presents from her uptown boys
She's got a choice

Uptown girl
You know I can't afford to buy her pearls
But maybe, someday, when my ship comes in
She'll understand what kind of guy I've been
And then I'll win

And when she's walking, she's looking so fine
And when she's talking, she'll say that she's mine

She'll say I'm not so tough
Just because I'm in love with an

Uptown girl
She's been living in her white-bread world
As long as anyone with hot blood can
And now, she's looking for a downtown man
That's what I am

Uptown girl, she's my uptown girl
You know I'm in love with an uptown girl, my uptown girl
You know I'm in love with an uptown girl, my uptown girl
You know I'm in love with an uptown girl, my uptown girl

Dis ah no mystery check the history
From you hear my voice it's no secret
Cheerleader song make the world sing along
Now Samantha J pon the remix
Me a di a di girl in the tight up skirt
But Omi call me cheerleader
Pompoms in my hand when I'm singing this song
Omi make me turn up the speaker

Say oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She's always right there when I need her
Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She's always right there when I need her

When I need motivation, my one solution
Is my queen cause she stay strong yeah yeah
She's always in my corner right there when I want her
All these other girls are tempting but I'm empty when you're gone
And they say
Do you need me
Do you think I'm pretty
Do I make you feel like cheating
I'm like no not really (nuh uh)

Cause oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She's always right there when I need her
Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She's always right there when I need her

If it's wrong I don't care I'm a right this
Thinks you do have me flying the highest
Say whatever what you want call me like it
For the haters out there, you can bite this
You gotta know how to
Walk like a model, talk like a model
Call me Ms. Jamaica because I'm a model
Been looking like say I won the lotto
Everywhere I go, got them off there singing like

Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her

She gives me love and affection
Baby did I mention
You're the only girl for me
No I don't need no next one
Mama loves you too
She thinks I made the right selection
All that's left to do is just for me to pop the question

Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her

I threw a wish in the well
Don't ask me, I'll never tell
I looked to you as it fell
And now you're in my way

I'd trade my soul for a wish
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn't looking for this
But now you're in my way

Your stare was holdin'
Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hot night, wind was blowin'
Where you think you're going, baby?

Hey, I just met you
And this is crazy
But here's my number
So call me, maybe?

It's hard to look right
At you baby
But here's my number
So call me, maybe?

Hey, I just met you
And this is crazy
But here's my number
So call me, maybe?

And all the other boys
Try to chase me
But here's my number
So call me, maybe?

You took your time with the call
I took no time with the fall
You gave me nothing at all
But still, you're in my way

I beg, and borrow and steal
At first sight and it's real
I didn't know I would feel it
But it's in my way

Your stare was holdin'
Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hot night, wind was blowin'
Where you think you're going, baby?

Hey, I just met you
And this is crazy
But here's my number
So call me, maybe?

It's hard to look right
At you baby
But here's my number
So call me, maybe?

Hey, I just met you
And this is crazy
But here's my number
So call me, maybe?

And all the other boys
Try to chase me
But here's my number
So call me, maybe?

Before you came into my life
I missed you so bad
I missed you so bad
I missed you so, so bad

Before you came into my life
I missed you so bad
And you should know that
I missed you so, so bad

It's hard to look right
At you baby
But here's my number
So call me, maybe?

Hey, I just met you
And this is crazy
But here's my number
So call me, maybe?

And all the other boys
Try to chase me
But here's my number
So call me, maybe?

Before you came into my life
I missed you so bad
I missed you so bad
I missed you so, so bad

Before you came into my life
I missed you so bad
And you should know that

So call me, maybe?

She was a fast machine, she kept her motor clean
She was the best damn woman that I ever seen
She had the sightless eyes, telling me no lies
Knocking me out with those American thighs
Taking more than her share, had me fighting for air
She told me to come, but I was already there
'Cause the walls start shaking, the Earth was quaking
My mind was aching, and we were making it

And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me all night long

Working double-time on the seduction line
She's one of a kind, she's just a-mine all mine
Wanted no applause, just another course
Made a meal outta me, and come back for more
Had to cool me down to take another round
Now, I'm back in the ring to take another swing
That the walls were shaking, the Earth was quaking
My mind was aching, and we were making it

And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me all night long
It knocked me out that
You shook me all night long
It had me shaking
And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me
Well, you took me

You really took me and
You shook me all night long
Ah, you shook me all night long
Yeah, yeah, you shook me all night long
You really got me and you, shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me
Yeah, you shook me
All night long

Oh, father tell me, do we get what we deserve?
Oh, we get what we deserve

And way down we go
Oh, way down we go
Say, way down we go
Way down we go

Whoa, you let your feet run wild
Time has come as we all go down
Yeah but for the falloh, my
Do you dare to look them right in the eyes?

'Cause they will run you down, down 'til the dark
Yes, and they will run you down, down 'til you fall
And they will run you down, down to your core
Yeah, 'til you can't crawl no more

And way down we go
Way down we go
Say, way down we go

'Cause they will run you down, down 'til you're caught
Way down we go

Whoa, baby, yeah
Whoa, baby
Baby
Way down we go
Yeah

And way down we go
Way down we go
Say, way down we go
Way down we go

Show me how to lie
You're getting better all the time
And turning all against the one
Is an art that's hard to teach
Another clever word
Sets off an unsuspecting herd
And as you step back into line
A mob jumps to their feet

Now dance, fucker, dance
Man, he never had a chance
And no one even knew
It was really only you

And now you steal away
Take him out today
Nice work you did
You're gonna go far, kid

With a thousand lies
And a good disguise
Hit 'em right between the eyes
Hit 'em right between the eyes
When you walk away
Nothing more to say
See the lightning in your eyes
See 'em running for their lives

Slowly out of line
And drifting closer in your sight
So play it out I'm wide-awake
It's a scene about me
There's something in your way
And now someone is gonna pay
And if you can't get what you want
Well it's all because of me

Now dance, fucker, dance
Man, I never had a chance
And no one even knew
It was really only you

And now you'll lead the way
Show the light of day
Nice work you did
You're gonna go far, kid
Trust, deceived

With a thousand lies
And a good disguise
Hit 'em right between the eyes
Hit 'em right between the eyes
When you walk away
Nothing more to say
See the lightning in your eyes
See 'em running for their lives

Now dance, fucker, dance
He never had a chance
And no one even knew
It was really only you

So dance, fucker, dance
I never had a chance
It was really only you

With a thousand lies
And a good disguise
Hit 'em right between the eyes
Hit 'em right between the eyes
When you walk away
Nothing more to say
See the lightning in your eyes
See 'em running for their lives

Clever alibis
Lord of the Flies
Hit 'em right between the eyes
Hit 'em right between the eyes
When you walk away
Nothing more to say
See the lightning in your eyes
See 'em running for their lives

I see your red door, I want it painted black
No colors anymore, I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
With flowers and my love both never to come back
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
Like a newborn baby, it just happens everyday
I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see my red door, I must have it painted black
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black
No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee this thing happening to you
If I look hard enough into the setting sun
My love will laugh with me before the morning comes

(I want to see it painted, painted, painted black
Black as night, black as coal
I want to see the sun, blotted out from the sky)

I see your red door, I want it painted black
(I want to see it painted, painted, painted black
Black as night, black as coal)
No colors any more, I want them to turn black
(I want to see the sun, blotted out from the sky, the sky, the sky)
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
(I want to see it painted, painted, painted black
Black as night, black as coal)
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes
(I want to see the sun, blotted out from the sky)

Mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm-mm

Oh, but my heart is in Havana (ay)
There's somethin' 'bout his manners (uh huh)

He didn't walk up with that "how you doin'?"
(When he came in the room)
He said there's a lot of girls I can do with

And papa says he got malo in him
He got me feelin' like

Ooh... I knew it when I met him

Got me feelin' like
Ooh... and then I had to tell him
