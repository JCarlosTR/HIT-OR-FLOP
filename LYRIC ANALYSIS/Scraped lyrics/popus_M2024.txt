(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know

Oh, it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)
Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, "For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"
He looks up, grinning like a devil

It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)
Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, "For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

I am unwritten, can't read my mind
I'm undefined
I'm just beginning, the pen's in my hand
Ending unplanned

Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words that you could not find

Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions

Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins

The rest is still unwritten

I break tradition, sometimes my tries
Are outside the line
We've been conditioned to not make mistakes
But I can't live that way

Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words that you could not find

Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions

Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins

Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken

Legend of the fall took the year like a bandit
Bought mama a crib and a brand new wagon

Star Trek roof in that Wraith of Khan
Girls get loose when they hear this song
Hundred on the dash get me close to God
We don't pray for love, we just pray for cars

I am not the only traveler
Who has not repaid his debt
I've been searching for a trail to follow again
Take me back to the night we met

And then I can tell myself
What the hell I'm supposed to do
And then I can tell myself
Not to ride along with you

I had all and then most of you, some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met
I don't know what I'm supposed to do, haunted by the ghost of you
Oh, take me back to the night we met

When the night was full of terrors
And your eyes were filled with tears
When you had not touched me yet
Oh, take me back to the night we met

I had all and then most of you, some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met
I don't know what I'm supposed to do, haunted by the ghost of you
Take me back to the night we met
---------------------------------------------------
I wanna take you somewhere so you know I care
But it's so cold and I don't know where
I brought you daffodils in a pretty string
But they won't flower like they did last spring
And I wanna kiss you, make you feel alright
I'm just so tired to share my nights
I wanna cry and I wanna love
But all my tears have been used up

On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up, up

And if somebody hurts you, I wanna fight
But my hands been broken one too many times
So I'll use my voice, I'll be so fucking rude
Words, they always win, but I know I'll lose
And I'd sing a song that'd be just ours
But I sang 'em all to another heart
And I wanna cry, I wanna learn to love
But all my tears have been used up

On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up, up

(Oh, need a love, now, my heart is thinking of)
I wanna sing a song that'd be just ours
But I sang 'em all to another heart
And I wanna cry, I wanna fall in love
But all my tears have been used up

On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up, up
---------------------------------------------------
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to heal
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound till I come back around

For now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
---------------------------------------------------
Yeah, yeah, uh (woo!)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

That's the way every day goes
Every time we've no control
If the sky is pink and white
If the ground is black and yellow
It's the same way you showed me
Nod my head, don't close my eyes
Halfway on a slow move
It's the same way you showed me
If you could fly, then you'd feel south
Up north's getting cold soon
The way it is, we're on land
Still I'm someone to hold true
Keep you cool when it's still alive
Won't let you down when it's all ruin

Just the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love
Glory from above
Regard, my dear
It's all downhill from here

In the wake of a hurricane
Dark skin of a summer shade
Nosedive into flood lines
Tall tower of milk crates
It's the same way you showed me
Cannonball off the porch side
Older kids trying off the roof
Just the same way you showed me (You showed)
If you could die and come back to life
Up for air from the swimming pool
You'd kneel down to the dry land
Kiss the Earth that birthed you
Gave you tools just to stay alive
And make it out when the sun is ruined

That's the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love
Glory from above
Regard, my dear
It's all downhill from here

Remember life, remember how it was
Climb trees, Michael Jackson, it all ends here
Say what up to Matthew, to Shoob
Say what up to Danny
Say what up to life immortality
Bending up my Nikes
Running out the Melpomene, nicotine
Stealing granny cigs (Take it easy)
Gimme something sweet
Bitch, I might like immortality
This is life, life immortality
---------------------------------------------------
Baby, I like your style

Grips on your waist
Front way, back way
You know that I don't play
Streets not safe
But I never run away
Even when I'm away
Oti, oti, there's never much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray, I pray

That's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me

Baby, I like your style

Strength and guidance
All that I'm wishing for my friends
Nobody makes it from my ends
I had to bust up the silence
You know you gotta stick by me
Soon as you see the text, reply me
I don't wanna spend time fighting
We've got no time

And that's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me

Got a pretty girl and she love me long time
Wine it, wine it, very long time
Oh yeah, very long time
Back up, back up, back up and wine it
Back up, back up and wine it, girl
Back up, back up, back up and wine it
Oh yeah, very long time
Back up, back up and wine it, girl

Tell me, I need to know, where do you wanna go?
'Cause if you're down, I'll take it slow
Make you lose control
Where, where, where
Where, where, where, where
Oh yeah, very long time
Where, where, where
Back up, back up and wine it, girl
Where, where, where, where
'Cause if you're down
Back up, back up and
'Cause if you're down
Back up, back up and
'Cause if you're down
Back up, back up and

I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
---------------------------------------------------
I just need someone in my life to give it structure
To handle all the selfish ways I'd spend my time without her
You're everything I want, but I can't deal with all your lovers
Saying I'm the one, but it's your actions that speak louder
Giving me love when you are down and need another
I've got to get away and let you go, I've got to get over

But I love you so
I love you so
I love you so
I love you so

I'm gonna pack my things and leave you behind
This feeling's old and I know that I've made up my mind
I hope you feel what I felt when you shattered my soul
'Cause you were cruel and I'm a fool
So please let me go

But I love you so (please let me go)
I love you so (please let me go)
I love you so (please let me go)
I love you so
---------------------------------------------------
Talking away
I don't know what I'm to say
I'll say it anyway
Today is another day to find you
Shying away
I'll be coming for your love. OK?

Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two

So needless to say
Of odds and ends
But I'll be stumbling away
Slowly learning that life is OK.
Say after me,
"It's no better to be safe than sorry."

Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two

Oh, things that you say. Yeah.
Is it life or just to play my worries away?
You're all the things I've got to remember
You're shying away
I'll be coming for you anyway

Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day

Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day

Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)
---------------------------------------------------
I met you in the dark
You lit me up
You made me feel as though
I was enough
We danced the night away
We drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute I was stone-cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told you
I think that you should get some rest

I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you
But I never showed
But I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I'll wake you up with some
Breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee
With a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars
For that night

When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that every day you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling, your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far, my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me
When I needed you most

I'm gonna love you 'til
My lungs give out
I promise 'til death we part
Like in our vows
So I wrote this song for you
Now everybody knows
That it's just you and me
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

Just say you won't let go
Oh, just say you won't let go
---------------------------------------------------
Tastes like strawberries on a summer evenin'
And it sounds just like a song
I want more berries and that summer feelin'
It's so wonderful and warm

Breathe me in, breathe me out
I don't know if I could ever go without
I'm just thinking out loud
I don't know if I could ever go without

Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar

Strawberries on a summer evenin'
Baby, you're the end of June
I want your belly and that summer feelin'
Getting washed away in you

Breathe me in, breathe me out
I don't know if I could ever go without

Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high

I just wanna taste it, I just wanna taste it
Watermelon sugar high

Tastes like strawberries on a summer evenin'
And it sounds just like a song
I want your belly and that summer feelin'
I don't know if I could ever go without

Watermelon sugar high

Watermelon sugar high (Sugar)
Watermelon sugar high (Sugar)
Watermelon sugar high

Watermelon sugar high

I just wanna taste it, I just wanna taste it (Woo)
Watermelon sugar high
I just wanna taste it, I just wanna taste it (Ooh)
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar

Last night, all I think about is you
Don't stop, baby, you can walk through
Don't want, baby, think about you
You know that I'm never gonna lose

Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a—

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

Usually I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but

Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I'll say goodbye

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Heat waves been fakin' me out

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror

It starts with one
All I know
It's so unreal
Watch you go

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter


One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself of a time when I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mockin' me
Actin' like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually
Be a memory of a time when I


I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter


One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme to explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
It's so unreal
You didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, they didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory
Of a time when I tried so hard


I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter


One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try

---------------------------------------------------
Found you when your heart was broke
I filled your cup until it overflowed
Took it so far to keep you close (keep you close)
I was afraid to leave you on your own

I said I'd catch you if you fall (fall)
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (all)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feeling so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinking you could live without me
Thinking you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (yeah, I don't know why)
Thinking you could live without me
Live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (I don't know why, yeah, yeah)

Gave love 'bout a hundred tries (hundred tries)
Just running from the demons in your mind
Then I took yours and made 'em mine (mine)
I didn't notice 'cause my love was blind

Said I'd catch you if you fall (fall)
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (all)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feeling so high but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinking you could live without me
Thinking you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (yeah, I don't know why)
Thinking you could live without me
Live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why, yeah

You don't have to say just what you did (what you did)
I already know (I know)
I had to go and find out from them (oh-woah)
So tell me, how's it feel? (oh-woah)

Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feeling so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinking you could live without me
Thinking you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (yeah, I don't know why)

Someone told me long ago
There's a calm before the storm
I know, it's been coming for some time
When it's over, so they say
It'll rain a sunny day
I know, shining down like water

I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain?
I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain?
Coming down on a sunny day

Yesterday, and days before
Sun is cold and rain is hard
I know, been that way for all my time
'Til forever, on it goes
Through the circle, fast and slow
I know, it can't stop, I wonder

I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain?
I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain?
Coming down on a sunny day

Yeah!

I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain?
I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain?
Coming down on a sunny day
---------------------------------------------------
Thought I found a way
Thought I found a way out (found)
But you never go away (never go away)
So I guess I gotta stay now

Oh, I hope someday I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear

Isn't it lovely? All alone
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home

Walking out of time
Looking for a better place (looking for a better place)
Something's on my mind
Always in my head space

But I know someday I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive outside I can't fight my fear

Isn't it lovely? All alone
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello. Welcome home

Whoa, yeah
Yeah, ah
Whoa, whoa
Hello, welcome home
---------------------------------------------------
Maybe it's the way you say my name
Maybe it's the way you play your game
But it's so good, I've never known anybody like you
But it's so good, I've never dreamed of nobody like you

And I've heard of a love that comes once in a lifetime
And I'm pretty sure that you are that love of mine

'Cause I'm in a field of dandelions
Wishing on every one that you'd be mine, mine
And I see forever in your eyes
I feel okay when I see you smile, smile

Wishing on dandelions all of the time
Praying to God that one day you'll be mine
Wishing on dandelions all of the time, all of the time

I think that you are the one for me
Cause it gets so hard to breathe
When you're looking at me
I've never felt so alive and free
When you're looking at me
I've never felt so happy

And I've heard of a love that comes once in a lifetime
And I'm pretty sure that you are that love of mine

Cause I'm in a field of dandelions
Wishing on every one that you'd be mine, mine
And I see forever in your eyes
I feel okay when I see you smile, smile

Wishing on dandelions all of the time
Praying to God that one day you'll be mine
Wishing on dandelions all of the time, all of the time

Dandelion into the wind you go
Won't you let my darling know?
Dandelion into the wind you go
Won't you let my darling know that

I'm in a field of dandelions
Wishing on every one that you'd be mine, mine
And I see forever in your eyes
I feel okay when I see you smile, smile

Wishing on dandelions all of the time
Praying to God that one day you'll be mine
Wishing on dandelions all of the time, all of the time

I'm in a field of dandelions
Wishing on every one that you'd be mine, mine

Young Metro, young Metro, young Metro (Sheesh)
Ayy (Ayy)
Young Metro, young Metro

Never need a bitch, I'm what a bitch need (Bitch need)
Tryna find the one that can fix me
I've been dodgin' death in the six-speed
Amphetamine got my stummy feelin' sickly
Yeah, I want it all now
I've been runnin' through the pussy, need a dog pound
Hundred models gettin' faded in the compound
Tryna love me, but they never get a pulse down

Why? 'Cause I'm heartless
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
All this money and this pain got me heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
Said I'm heartless
Tryna be a better man, but I'm heartless
Never be a weddin' plan for the heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless

Said I'm heartless
So much pussy, it be fallin' out the pocket
Metro Boomin turn this ho into a moshpit
Tesla pill got me flyin' like a cockpit
Yeah, I got her watchin'
Call me up, turn that pussy to a faucet
Duffle bags full of drugs and a rocket
Stix drunk, but he never miss a target
Photoshoots, I'm a star now (Star)
I'm talkin' Time, Rolling Stone, and Bazaar now (Bazaar now)
Sellin' dreams to these girls with their guard down (What?)
Seven years, I've been swimmin' with the sharks now

Why? 'Cause I'm heartless
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
All this money and this pain got me heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
Said I'm heartless
Tryna be a better man, but I'm heartless
Never be a weddin' plan for the heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless

I lost my heart and my mind
I try to always do right
I thought I lost you this time
You just came back in my life
You never gave up on me (Why don't you?)
I'll never know what you see (Why won't you?)
I don't do well when alone (Oh yeah)
You hear it clear in my tone

'Cause I'm heartless (Ooh)
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
All this money and this pain got me heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
Said I'm heartless
Tryna be a better man, but I'm heartless
Never be a weddin' plan for the heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
---------------------------------------------------
Welcome to your life
There's no turning back
Even while we sleep
We will find you

Acting on your best behaviour
Turn your back on mother nature
Everybody wants to rule the world

It's my own design
It's my own remorse
Help me to decide
Help me make the most

Of freedom and of pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever
Everybody wants to rule the world

There's a room where the light won't find you
Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down
When they do I'll be right behind you

So glad we've almost made it
So sad they had to fade it
Everybody wants to rule the world

I can't stand this indecision
Married with a lack of vision
Everybody wants to rule the world
Say that you'll never never never never need it
One headline why believe it?
Everybody wants to rule the world

All for freedom and for pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever
Everybody wants to rule the world

Going out tonight
Changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Everything she never had she's showing off


Driving too fast
Moon is breaking through her hair
She's heading for something that she won't forget
Having no regrets is all that she really wants


We're only getting older, baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change me and you


Chasing it tonight,
Doubts are running 'round her head
He's waiting, hides behind a cigarette
Heart is beating loud, and she doesn't want it to stop


Moving too fast
Moon is lighting up her skin
She's falling, doesn't even know it yet
Having no regrets is all that she really wants


We're only getting older, baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change me and you


Going out tonight
Changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Reminds her of the missing piece of innocence she lost


We're only getting older, baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change, baby
It will never change, baby
It will never change me and you
---------------------------------------------------
First things first
I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh ooh
The way that things have been, oh ooh

Second things second
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh ooh
The master of my sea, oh ooh

I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Third things third
Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh ooh
Your spirit up above, oh ooh

I was choking in the crowd
Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
Till it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...

Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Last things last
By the grace of the fire and the flames
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh ooh
The blood in my veins, oh ooh
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
Till it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...

Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Don't blame me
Love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right
Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life

I've been breaking hearts a long time
And toying with them older guys
Just playthings for me to use
Something happened for the first time
In the darkest little paradise
Shaking, pacing, I just need you

For you
I would cross the line
I would waste my time
I would lose my mind
They say, "She's gone too far this time."

Don't blame me
Love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right
Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life

Don't blame me
Love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right
Oh, Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life

My name is whatever you decide
And I'm just gonna call you mine
I'm insane, but I'm your baby (your baby)
Echoes (echoes) of your name inside my mind
Halo, hiding my obsession
I once was poison ivy, but now I'm your daisy

And, baby, for you
I would fall from grace
Just to touch your face
If you walk away
I'd beg you on my knees to stay

Don't blame me
Love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right
Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life

Don't blame me
Love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right
Oh, Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life

I get so high, oh
Every time you're—every time you're loving me
You're loving me
Trip of my life, oh
Every time you're—every time you're touching me
You're touching me

Every time you're—every time you're loving me

Oh, Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life
(Using for the rest of my life. Oh!)

Don't blame me
Love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right (doing it right, no)
Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life

Don't blame me
Love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right (you ain't doing it...)
Oh, Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life (I'll be using, I'll be using)

I get so high, oh
Every time you're—every time you're loving me
You're loving me
Oh, Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life

Every breath you take
And every move you make
Every bond you break
Every step you take
I'll be watching you
Every single day
And every word you say
Every game you play
Every night you stay
I'll be watching you

Oh, can't you see you belong to me?
How my poor heart aches with every step you take

Every move you make
And every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake
I'll be watching you

Since you've gone, I've been lost without a trace
I dream at night, I can only see your face
I look around, but it's you I can't replace
I feel so cold, and I long for your embrace
I keep crying baby, baby, please

Mm, mm, mm, mm
Mm, mm, mm

Oh, can't you see you belong to me?
How my poor heart aches with every step you take

Every move you make
And every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake
I'll be watching you
Every move you make
Every step you take
I'll be watching you

I've been reading books of old
The legends and the myths
Achilles and his gold
Hercules and his gifts
Spiderman's control
And Batman with his fists
And clearly I don't see myself upon that list

But she said, "Where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can kiss
I want something just like this"

Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo

Oh, I want something just like this
I want something just like this

I've been reading books of old
The legends and the myths
The testaments they told
The moon and its eclipse
And Superman unrolls
A suit before he lifts
But I'm not the kind of person that it fits

She said, "Where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can miss
I want something just like this
I want something just like this"

Oh, I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo

Where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can kiss
I want something just like this

Oh, I want something just like this
Oh, I want something just like this
Oh, I want something just like this

May I have your attention please?
May I have your attention please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here

Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam and Tommy just burst in the door
And started whooping her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwing her over furniture (Ah!)
It's the return of the... "Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"
And Dr. Dre said... nothing, you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement! (Ha-ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem

"Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walking around grabbing his you-know-what
Flipping the you-know-who." "Yeah, but he's so cute though!"
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse, than what's going on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes, I wanna get on TV and just let loose, but can't
But it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
"My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips"
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course they gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
"We ain't nothing but mammals.." Well, some of us cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope

But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
"But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?"
Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can, sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Yo Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch, put me on blast on MTV
"Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee!"
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me
So I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me; who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me
It just might be the next best thing but not quite me!

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

I'm like a head trip to listen to, cause I'm only giving you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your living room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it
In front of y'all and I don't gotta be false or sugarcoated at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it
I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums
It's funny; 'cause at the rate I'm going when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurses asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spitting on your onion rings

Or in the parking lot, circling
Screaming "I don't give a fuck!"
With his windows down and his system up
So, will the real Shady please stand up?
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Ha ha
Guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us
Fuck it, let's all stand up
---------------------------------------------------
My libido's a beating drum
Everything is yet to come
Lizard king that I've become
Preparing for the future run
Everything is yet to blend
Mixing with my dirty friend
Our group has always been
And always will until the end

You know I'm a black unicorn
I'm a magnetic flare
And don't know me at all
Nevermind. I don't care

My libido's a beating drum
Everything is yet to come
Loser in the diamond sky
And it's ok, all right
And it's over, totally hangover
Completely goddamned loner, and you can takeover
But you won't. My libido's a beating drum
Everything is yet to come

Someday somehow
I'm not sober enough
For prediction and that's alright
Live fast and die young (Woo!)
---------------------------------------------------
I still remember
Third of December
Me in your sweater
You said it looked better

On me, than it did you
Only if you knew
How much I liked you
But I watch your eyes, as she

Walks by
What a sight for
Sore eyes
Brighter than a
Blue sky
She's got you
Mesmerized
While I die

Why would you ever kiss me?
I'm not even half as pretty
You gave her your sweater
It's just polyester, but you like her better
Wish I were Heather

Watch as she stands with
Her holding your hand
Put your arm 'round her shoulder
Now I'm getting colder

But how could I hate her?
She's such an angel
But then again, kinda
Wish she were dead, as she

Walks by
What a sight for
Sore eyes
Brighter than a
Blue sky
She's got you
Mesmerized
While I die

Why would you ever kiss me?
I'm not even half as pretty
You gave her your sweater
It's just polyester, but you like her better
I wish I were Heather

Wish I were Heather
Wish I were Heather

Why would you ever kiss me?
I'm not even half as pretty
You gave her your sweater
It's just polyester
But you like her better
Wish I were
---------------------------------------------------
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

Your man on the road, he doin' promo
You said, "Keep our business on the low-low"
I'm just tryna get you out the friend zone
'Cause you look even better than the photos
I can't find your house, send me the info
Driving through the gated residential
Found out I was coming, sent your friends home
Keep on tryna hide it, but your friends know

I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

I'ma let you know and keep it simple
Tryna keep it up don't seem so simple
I just fucked two bitches 'fore I saw you
And you gon' have to do it at my tempo
Always tryna send me off to rehab
Drugs started feeling like it's decaf
I'm just tryna live life for the moment
And all these motherfuckers want a relapse

I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

Hills have eyes, the hills have eyes
Who are you to judge? Who are you to judge?
Hide your lies, girl, hide your lies (Hide your lies, oh, baby)
Only you to trust, only you

I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

What about love? What about love?
---------------------------------------------------
Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)
I know the feeling haunt you (Haunt)


This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars approach you, all the stars approach you, all the stars approach you
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer


Tell me what you gon' do to me
Confrontation ain't nothing new to me
You can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue
But you can't bring the truth to me
Fuck you and all your expectations
I don't even want your congratulations
I recognize your false confidence
And calculated promises all in your conversation
I hate people that feel entitled
Look at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you
Oh, you important?
You the moral to the story? You endorsing?
Motherfucker, I don't even like you
Corrupt a man's heart with a gift
That's how you find out who you dealing with
A small percentage who I'm building with
I want the credit if I'm losing or I'm winning
On my mama, that's the realest shit

Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)
I know the feeling haunt you (Haunt)


This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars approach you, all the stars approach you, all the stars approach you
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer

Skin covered in ego
Get to talking like ya involved, like a rebound
Got no end game, got no ways out, got to stay down
It's the way that you making me feel
Like nobody ever loved me like you do, you do
You kinda feel like you're tryna get away from me
If you do, I won't move
I ain't just cry for no reason, I ain't just pray for no reason
I give thanks for the days, for the hours
And another way, another life breathing
I did it all 'cause it feel good
I wouldn't do it at all if it feel bad
Better live your life, we're running out of time


Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for? (Ooh)
Or do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)
I know the feeling haunt you (Haunt)


This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars approach you, all the stars approach you, all the stars approach you
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer
---------------------------------------------------
Yeah
I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey, what daddy always tell you?
Straighten up little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you crying about?
You got me.

Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there?
Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more crying, wipe them tears
Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Lainie Uncle's crazy, ain't he?
Yeah, but he loves you girl and you better know it
We're all we got in this world
When it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls
Two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze
I know it's confusing you
Daddy's always on the move, mamma's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growing up as daddy, that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us
I don't see us ever being together ever again
Like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then of course everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream

Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise mama's gon' be alright

(Ha)
It's funny
I remember back one year when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up
And stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em were from me
'Cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying
'Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
And at the time every house that we lived in
Either kept getting broken into and robbed
Or shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar
Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurts so bad it broke your momma's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back
On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD and met Dr. Dre
And flew you and momma out to see me
But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
Then you started seeing daddy on the T.V. and momma didn't like it
And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sitting in this empty house, just reminiscing
Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, I guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
Lainie I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah
It's got a ring to it don't it?
Shh, mama's only gone for the moment

Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise mama's gon' be alright

And if you ask me to
Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'mma give you the world
I'mma buy a diamond ring for you
I'mma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'mma break that birdie's neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat don't fuck with dad (ha ha)
---------------------------------------------------
Ooh
Na-na, yeah

I saw you dancing in a crowded room (Uh)
You look so happy when I'm not with you
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eye

I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away

You could've asked me why I broke your heart
You could've told me that you fell apart
But you walked past me like I wasn't there
And just pretended like you didn't care

I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away

Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
Save your tears for another day
Save your tears for another day (So)

I made you think that I would always stay
I said some things that I should never say
Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine
And now you won't love me for a second time

I don't know why I run away, oh, girl
Said, I make you cry when I run away

Girl, take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
I realize that I'm much too late
And you deserve someone better
Save your tears for another day (Oh yeah)
Save your tears for another day (Yeah)

I don't know why I run away
I'll make you cry when I run away

Save your tears for another day
Ooh, girl, I said (Ah)
Save your tears for another day (Ah)

Save your tears for another day (Ah)
Save your tears for another day (Ah)
---------------------------------------------------
I took my drugs and took my lovin' when I left out the spot
I left the party with a Barbie, marking X on the dot
She calls my phone up, but I told her, "I'm a loner" (Uh)
But she likes my watch and my droptop and my persona (Uh)
We hit the highway, one-five-five with my whole foot on the dash
She's in my ear, she's got no fear, she could care less if we crash

But on my radar, I've got some nerve to play hard
I waited for my chance, but playboys, we don't dance, dance, dance

I lost my heart (Uh)
Speedin' car, goin' ninety in the rain
She took my heart, filled it with nothin' but pain
This beat in my dance is not for romance
I wanna stay, but playboys, we don't dance, dance, dance (I)

So I won't dance again (I), oh, baby
No, I won't dance again (That's why), oh, yeah (Uh)
No, I won't dance again (I)
No, I won't dance again
Pretty baby, ooh

Uh
Face in the daylight, wastin' time on the stars in the sky
She's got my pager, blankets of love fall on my eyes
Then I'm reminded, love don't come 'til you find it
I just hope that it's workin', I'm yearnin', I'm searchin', uh
The afterparty was on Wilson and 73rd
You got the notion that somebody else was with me first

But on my radar, you had some nerve to play hard
You took away my chance, but playboys, we don't dance, dance, dance

I lost my heart (Uh)
Speedin' car goin' ninety in the rain
She took my heart, filled it with nothin' but pain
This beat in my dance is not for romance
I wanna stay, but playboys, we don't dance, dance, dance (I)

So I won't dance again (I), oh, baby
No, I won't dance again (That's why), oh, yeah (Uh)
No, I won't dance again (I)
No, I won't dance again
Pretty baby, ooh
---------------------------------------------------
Coming out of my cage and I've been doing just fine
Gotta, gotta be down, because I want it all
It started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this?
It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss
Now I'm falling asleep and she's calling a cab
While he's having a smoke and she's taking a drag
Now they're going to bed and my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head, but she's touching his

Chest now, he takes off her
Dress now, let me go
And I just can't look, it's killing me
They're taking control

Jealousy, turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies, choking on your alibis
But it's just the price I pay, destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes, 'cause I'm Mr. Brightside

I'm coming out of my cage and I've been doing just fine
Gotta, gotta be down, because I want it all
It started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this?
It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss

While he's having a smoke and she's taking a drag
Now they're going to bed and my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head, but she's touching his

I never...
I never...
I never...

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And she's always gone too long
Anytime she goes away

Wonder this time where she's gone
Wonder if she's gone to stay
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away

And I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know
Hey, I oughtta leave young thing alone
But ain't no sunshine when she's gone

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away
Anytime she goes away
Anytime she goes away
Anytime she goes away

Living easy, lovin' free
Season ticket on a one way ride
Asking nothing, leave me be
Taking everythin' in my stride
Don't need reason, don't need rhyme
Ain't nothing I'd rather do
Goin' down, party time
My friends are gonna be there too, yeah

I'm on the highway to hell
On the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell

No stop signs, speed limit
Nobody's gonna slow me down
Like a wheel, gonna spin it
Nobody's gonna mess me around
Hey Satan, payin' my dues
Playing in a rocking band
Hey mama, look at me
I'm on the way to the promised land
Woo!

I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell

Don't stop me
Heh, heh!

I'm on the highway to hell
On the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
(Highway to hell) I'm on the highway to hell
(Highway to hell) Highway to hell
(Highway to hell) Highway to hell
(Highway to hell)

And I'm going down
All the way
I'm on the highway to hell

Grind hard, nigga, grind hard, I done grind hard
Late nights playin' b-ball with a decoy
I was on the corner with the robbers and the d-boys
Now I'm on the charts, man, this shit is unbelievable
Mama, it's a lot of secrets that I had to keep from you
Got in so much trouble, thought the teachers had beef with you
And it paid off 'cause we livin' like the Greeks and Jews
Used to leave your stove runnin', stove runnin' (21, 21)
Now it's Louis rags when my nose runnin'
Got it out the mud, I don't owe nothin'
You pussy ass niggas, I ain't on nothin'
Wanna see me fucked up 'cause they poor hustlin'
The same niggas with me back when I was head itchin'
Man I'm having nightmares that the feds listenin'
You fake gangstas pump fakin' and they scared snitchin'
The coupe fast and it's fucking up the dash digits

Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money

It's a bag on his head, I'ma pick it up
It was money in the house, I used to stick it up
Got your main bitch chillin', splashin', tryna lick it up
Dick ridin', niggas always tryna flick it up
I ain't tryna take no pictures, bitch I'm rollin' Swishers
I count my back end then I jump out with that pistol
If you ain't suckin' dick you get a early dismissal
We got your wifey at the spot, she tryna lick a pickle
I just went and bought a Lamb and it cost a nickel
And I came from the bottom and it feel good
And I went platinum, still in the hood
And I take the gang with me everywhere I go
Why these niggas hatin' on me? Man I don't know
Ain't a place in the world that I can't go
And I got a hundred racks inside a Go-Go
And I get a hundred racks for a show, show
Wanna give a bitch my heart but I can't though
I can't fall in love with a stank ho
Lil' bitch I fell in love with the bank ho
And you know I love that good drank, ho

Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money

You're my old school runner, you're my old school runner
But my new school runnin', it costs more than a hundred
You lil' niggas so bummy (21)
Make a diss song, they gon' wrap you like a mummy
My young niggas geekin' on boot like zombies
They hungry, up it on you then they tell you, "Run it"
I stole cars, drove them like go-karts (facts)
Niggas actin' like bitches, they got both parts (cat)
And I came from the gutter, I don't got no heart
And I'm straight up out the gutter, I don't got no heart
Nigga when they killed my brother, I had to go hard
Put that chopper in his face and then I Bogart
Niggas tryna cross me, I don't understand it
I'm just tryna take care of the family
And I'm sippin' Codeine, not Brandy (21)
And I'm sippin' Codeine, I'm an addict
You go to jail, can't depend on a bad bitch
She fucked and sucked him tryna keep up with the fashion
And I'm really, really rich and I ain't braggin'
Sometimes I really can't believe this shit happened
Who woulda thought I'd make it rappin'?
I almost lost my life when I was trappin'

Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the

Bitch, I did it, I made it, I'm loved and I'm hated
I started from the bottom, now my neighborhood is gated
They say, "Drink to your accomplishments," so every night I'm faded
Feel like every other day, me and somebody new related
You're my sister, cousin, brother from the other side? (The other side)
Well, I don't know who told you that (My mama)
Well, she fucking lied
Ay, wake up, wake up, get your cake up
Cut it up like it's cocaine, shake up
All the streets with all these beats
I body beats, I'm not discreet (Per-Per-Perfect)
This is how I feel on the inside
All you non-talent rappin' motherfuckers better run and hide
You worthless, you have no purpose, fuckin' imposter
You gots to get it through your head
You won't ever get no handout
Fuckin' with your ass, it'd be like throwing a band out (Per-Per-Perfect)
My flow increased, my dough increased
You know I leave them all deceased
I am a fucking beast, I'm from the East
I keep the peace, don't need a piece
But I keep a piece, got it, capisce?
That boy gon' eat, this is a feast
Once I release, I'm smokin' trees
I bought my shit, I don't need no lease
So fuck you up like Master P (Perfect)
This shit right here a masterpiece, I'm comin' in hot like the police
Shooting my shot like the police
All on the block like the police, man, who gon' (Stop, stop)
The police {from leaving bodies in the motherfuckin' streets, man?} (Fire, per-per-perfect)


Logic cites Nujabes, MF Doom, RZA, and Kanye West as key inspirations behind his production style
---------------------------------------------------
I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listened as the crowd would sing,
"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know St. Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know St. Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
---------------------------------------------------
I couldn't tell you a thing about that night
Between the drinks and the blinding lights
But even if just for a moment or two
I danced with you, I danced with you, I danced with you
Stumbling onto an empty street
Almost escaping my memory
But in the morning when I came to
I thought of you, I thought of you, I thought of you

Every step I take
Everywhere I go
I see your face, unforgettable
Every heart you break
You will never know
I see your face, unforgettable

Unforgettable
Unforgettable

Of every beautiful lie that I've been told
Yours is the one I like the most
Yours is the one that I hold so close
Give up the ghost, give up the ghost, give up the ghost
It was just one night, it was just one night
Now I can't get off of my mind
It was just one time, it was just one time
Even if you'll never be mine

Every step I take
Everywhere I go
I see your face, unforgettable
Every heart you break
You will never know
I see your face, unforgettable

Unforgettable
I see your face, unforgettable

I see your (unforgettable)
I see your
Unforgettable
I see your face, unforgettable

Every step I take
Everywhere I go
I see your face, unforgettable
Every heart you break
You will never know
I see your face, unforgettable
Every step I take
Everywhere I go
I see your face, unforgettable
Every heart you break
You will never know
I see your face, unforgettable

You're the only power (Power)
You're the only power that can
You're the only power (Power)
You're the only power that can
Oh, oh, oh, father...

Beautiful mornin', you're the sun in my mornin', babe
Who can I turn to?
Nothin' unwanted
After all, who can I turn to?
Beautiful mornin', you're the sun in my mornin', babe
If I don't turn to you
Nothin' unwanted
No other help I know, I stretch my hands


I just wanna feel liberated, I-I, na-na-na
Who can I turn to?
I just wanna feel liberated, I-I, na-na-na
After all, who can I turn to?
If I ever instigated, I am sorry
If I don't turn to you
Tell me who in here could relate, I-I-I
No other help I know, I stretch my hands


Now, if I fuck this model
And she just bleached her asshole
And I get bleach on my T-shirt
I'ma feel like an asshole
I was high when I met her
We was down in Tribeca
She'll get under your skin if you let her
She'll get under your skin if you-uh
I don't even wanna talk about it
I don't even wanna talk about it
I don't even wanna say nothin'
Everybody gon' say somethin'
I'd be worried if they said nothin'
Remind me where I know you from
She lookin' like she owe you some'n
You know just what we want
I wanna wake up with you in my...
I wanna wake up with you in my...


Beautiful mornin', you're the sun in my mornin', babe
Who can I turn to?
Beautiful mornin'
Nothin' unwanted
After all, who can I turn to?
Beautiful mornin', you're the sun in my mornin', babe
If I don't turn to you
Nothin' unwanted
No other help I know, I stretch my hands


I just wanna feel liberated, I-I, na-na-na
Who can I turn to?
I just wanna feel liberated, I-I, na-na-na
After all, who can I turn to?
If I ever instigated, I am sorry
If I don't turn to you
Tell me who in here could relate, I-I-I
No other help I know, I stretch my hands
---------------------------------------------------
And I'd give up forever to touch you
'Cause I know that you feel me somehow
You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be
And I don't wanna go home right now

And all I can taste is this moment
And all I can breathe is your life
When sooner or later it's over
I just don't wanna miss you tonight

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming
Or the moment of truth in your lies
When everything feels like the movies
Yeah, you bleed just to know you're alive

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am

Ladies up in here tonight
No fighting
We got the refugees up in here
No fighting, no fighting

Shakira, Shakira

I never really knew that she could dance like this
She make a man wanna speak Spanish
¿Como se llama (si), bonita (si), mi casa (si, Shakira Shakira), su casa

Oh baby when you talk like that
You make a woman go mad
So be wise (Si!) and keep on (Si!)
Reading the signs of my body
(Uno, dos, tres, cuatro)

I'm on tonight
You know my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel it's right
All the attraction, the tension
Don't you see baby? this is perfection

Hey girl, I can see your body moving
And it's driving me crazy
And I didn't have the slightest idea
Until I saw you dancing

And when you walk up on the dance floor
Nobody cannot ignore the way you move your body, girl (Just smooth)
And everything's so unexpected – the way you right and left it
So you can keep on shaking it (Let's go)

Half animal, half man

But you seem to have a plan
My will and self-restraint
Have come to fail now, fail now
See, I'm doing what I can, but I can't so you know
That's a bit too hard to explain
(Uno, dos, tres, cuatro)

Baila en la calle de noche (Uh, yeah)

We lead the whole club jazzy
Why the CIA wanna watch us?
Colombians and Haitians

Bo-bop-so-bop, no more do we snatch ropes
Refugees run the seas 'cause we own our own boats, boats (No fighting)

Once upon a time, not so long ago

Tommy used to work on the docks
Union's been on strike, he's down on his luck
It's tough
So tough
Gina works the diner all day
Working for her man, she brings home her pay
For love
Mm, for love

She says, "We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot"

Whoa, we're halfway there
Whoa-oh, living on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear
Whoa-oh, living on a prayer

Tommy's got his six-string in hock
Now he's holding in, when he used to make it talk
So tough
Ooh, it's tough
Gina dreams of running away
When she cries in the night, Tommy whispers
"Baby, it's okay
Someday"

We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot

Whoa, we're halfway there
Whoa-oh, living on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
Whoa-oh, living on a prayer, living on a prayer

Ooh, we gotta hold on, ready or not
You live for the fight when that's all that you've got

Whoa, we're halfway there
Whoa-oh, living on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Whoa-oh, living on a prayer

Whoa, we're halfway there
Whoa-oh, living on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Whoa-oh, living on a prayer

Whoa, we're halfway there
Whoa-oh, living on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Whoa-oh, living on a prayer
---------------------------------------------------
Ayy, ayy, ayy

Wake up with no jammies (Nope)
Lobster tail for dinner

Got, got it if you want it

Gold jewelry shinin' so bright
Strawberry champagne on ice
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Sex by the fire at night
Silk sheets and diamonds all white
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like

I'm talkin' trips to Puerto Rico (Bih)
Say the word and we go (Say it)

I promise that your smile ain't gon' ever leave
Shoppin' sprees in Paris

---------------------------------------------------
I wanna follow where she goes
I think about her and she knows it
I wanna let her take control
'Cause every time that she gets close, yeah

She pulls me in enough to keep me guessing, mmm
And maybe I should stop and start confessing
Confessing, yeah

Oh, I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back

You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back

There's nothing holdin' me back
There's nothing holdin' me back

She says that she's never afraid
Just picture everybody naked
She really doesn't like to wait
Not really into hesitation

Pulls me in enough to keep me guessing, whoa
And maybe I should stop and start confessing
Confessing, yeah

Oh, I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back

You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back

There's nothing holdin' me back

'Cause if we lost our minds
And we took it way too far
I know we'd be alright,
Know we would be alright

If you were by my side
And we stumbled in the dark
I know we'd be alright,
I know we would be alright

'Cause if we lost our minds
And we took it way too far
I know we'd be alright,
I know we would be alright

If you were by my side
And we stumbled in the dark
I know we'd be alright,
We would be alright

Oh, I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back

You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back

There's nothing holdin' me back

I feel so free
When you're with me,
Baby

Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back

We're rolling suicide

Wake up (wake up)
Grab a brush and put a little make-up
Hide the scars to fade away the shake-up (hide the scars to fade away the...)
Why'd you leave the keys upon the table?
Here you go create another fable

You wanted to
Grab a brush and put a little makeup
You wanted to
Hide the scars to fade away the shake-up
You wanted to
Why'd you leave the keys upon the table?
You wanted to

I don't think you trust
In my self-righteous suicide
I cry when angels deserve to
Die

Wake up (wake up)
Grab a brush and put a little make-up

I don't think you trust
In my self-righteous suicide
I cry when angels deserve to die
In my self-righteous suicide

Father, father, father, father
Father, into your hands I commend my spirit
Father, into your hands
Why have you forsaken me?
In your eyes forsaken me
In your thoughts forsaken me
In your heart forsaken me, oh

Trust in my self-righteous suicide
I cry when angels deserve to die
In my self-righteous suicide
I cry when angels deserve to die
---------------------------------------------------
We found each other
I helped you out of a broken place
You gave me comfort
But falling for you was my mistake

I put you on top, I put you on top
I claimed you so proud and openly
And when times were rough, when times were rough
I made sure I held you close to me

So call out my name (call out my name)
Call out my name when I kiss you so gently
I want you to stay (want you to stay)
I want you to stay, even though you don't want me
Girl, why can't you wait? (Why can't you wait, baby?)
Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of love?
Won't you call out my name? (Call out my name)
Girl, call out my name, and I'll be on my way and
I'll be on my

I said I didn't feel nothing, baby, but I lied
I almost cut a piece of myself for your life
Guess I was just another pit stop
'Til you made up your mind
You just wasted my time

You were on top, I put you on top
I claimed you so proud and openly, babe
And when times were rough, when times were rough
I made sure I held you close to me!

So call out my name (call out my name, baby)
So call out my name when I kiss you
So gently, oh, I want you to stay (I want you to stay)
I want you to stay even though you don't want me
Girl, why can't you wait? (Girl, why can't you wait 'til I?)
Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of loving?
Babe, call out my name (say call out my name, baby)
Girl, call out my name, and I'll be on my way
And I'll be on my

On my way, on my way
On my way, on my way, ooh
On my way, on my way, on my way
On my way, on my way, on my way
(On my)
---------------------------------------------------

What I'm involved with is deeper than the Mason's baby
Baby, and it ain't no secret

---------------------------------------------------
Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are

I had to find you
Tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart

Tell me your secrets
And ask me your questions
Oh, let's go back to the start

Running in circles
Coming up tails
Heads on a science apart

Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard

Oh, take me back to the start

I was just guessing
At numbers and figures
Pulling the puzzles apart

Questions of science
Science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart

Tell me you love me
Come back and haunt me
Oh, and I rush to the start

Running in circles
Chasing our tails
Coming back as we are

Nobody said it was easy
Oh, it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be so hard

I'm going back to the start

Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
---------------------------------------------------
Brown guilty eyes and little white lies
Yeah, I played dumb but I always knew
That you talked to her, maybe did even worse
I kept quiet so I could keep you

And ain't it funny
How you ran to her
The second that we called it quits?

And ain't it funny
How you said you were friends?
Now it sure as hell don't look like it

You betrayed me
And I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah

You talked to her
When we were together
Loved you at your worst
But that didn't matter

It took you two weeks
To go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat
But you're still a traitor

Now you bring her around
Just to shut me down
Show her off like she's a new trophy

And I know if you were true
There's no damn way that you
Could fall in love with somebody that quickly

Ain't it funny
All the twisted games
All the questions you used to avoid?

Ain't it funny?
Remember I brought her up
And you told me I was paranoid

You betrayed me
And I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah

You talked to her
When we were together
Loved you at your worst
But that didn't matter

It took you two weeks
To go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat
But you're still a traitor

God, I wish that you had thought this through
Before I went and fell in love with you
When she's sleeping in the bed we made
Don't you dare forget about the way

You betrayed me
'Cause I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah

You talked to her
When we were together
You gave me your word
But that didn't matter

It took you two weeks
To go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat
But you're still

You're still a traitor
Yeah, you're still a traitor

God, I wish that you had thought this through
Before I went and fell in love with you
---------------------------------------------------
When the days are cold
And the cards all fold
And the saints we see
Are all made of gold

When your dreams all fail
And the ones we hail
Are the worst of all
And the blood's run stale

I wanna hide the truth
I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside
There's nowhere we can hide

No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
Don't get too close
It's dark inside
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide

At the curtain's call
It's the last of all
When the lights fade out
All the sinners crawl

So they dug your grave
And the masquerade
Will come calling out
At the mess you've made

Don't wanna let you down
But I am hell-bound
Though this is all for you
Don't wanna hide the truth

No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
Don't get too close
It's dark inside
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide

They say it's what you make
I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul
I need to let you go

Your eyes, they shine so bright
I wanna save that light
I can't escape this now
Unless you show me how

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
Don't get too close
It's dark inside
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
---------------------------------------------------
You're insecure
Don't know what for
You're turning heads when you walk through the door
Don't need make-up
To cover up
Being the way that you are is enough


Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you


Baby you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know
Oh, oh
You don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'd understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know
Oh, oh
You don't know you're beautiful
Oh, oh
That's what makes you beautiful


So c-come on
You got it wrong
To prove I'm right
I put it in a song
I don't know why
You're being shy
And turn away when I look into your eye-eye-eyes


Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you


Baby you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know
Oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know
Oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful
Oh oh


That's what makes you beautiful

Nana nana nana nana
Nana nana nana nana
Nana nana nana nana


Baby you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell


You don't know
Oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful

Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know
Oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful (Oh)
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
(
desperately)
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know
Oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful
Oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful
Oh oh


That's what makes you beautiful
---------------------------------------------------
Take you like a drug
I taste you on my tongue

You ask me what I'm thinking about
I tell you that I'm thinking about
Whatever you're thinking about (Ah)
Tell me something that I'll forget
And you might have to tell me again
It's crazy what you'll do for a friend

Go ahead and cry, little girl
Nobody does it like you do
I know how much it matters to you
I know that you got daddy issues
And if you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I know that you got daddy issues, and I do too

I tried to write your name in the rain
But the rain never came
So I made with the sun
The shade
Always comes at the worst time (Ah)

You ask me what I'm thinking about
I tell you that I'm thinking about
Whatever you're thinking about
Tell me something that I'll forget
And you might have to tell me again
It's crazy what you'll do for a friend

Go ahead and cry, little girl
Nobody does it like you do
I know how much it matters to you
I know that you got daddy issues
And if you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I know that you got daddy issues

I keep on trying to let you go
I'm dying to let you know
How I'm getting on
I didn't cry when you left at first
But now that you're dead it hurts
This time I gotta know
Where did my daddy go?
I'm not entirely here
Half of me has disappeared

Go ahead and cry, little boy
You know that your daddy did too
You know what your mama went through
You gotta let it out soon, just let it out

Go ahead and cry, little girl
Nobody does it like you do
I know how much it matters to you
I know that you got daddy issues
And if you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I know that you got daddy issues, and I do too

If you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I know that you got daddy issues, and I do too

Some folks are born made to wave the flag
Ooh, they're red, white and blue
And when the band plays "Hail To The Chief"
Ooh, they point the cannon at you, Lord

It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no senator's son, son
It ain't me, it ain't me; I ain't no fortunate one, no

Some folks are born silver spoon in hand
Lord, don't they help themselves, oh
But when the taxman come to the door
Lord, the house lookin' like a rummage sale, yeah

It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no millionaire's son, no, no
It ain't me, it ain't me; I ain't no fortunate one, no

Yeah!
Some folks inherit star-spangled eyes
Ooh, they send you down to war, Lord
And when you ask 'em, "How much should we give?"
Ooh, they only answer, "More! More! More!" Yo

It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no military son, son
It ain't me, it ain't me; I ain't no fortunate one, one

It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no fortunate one, no no no
It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no fortunate son, no no no
It ain't me, it ain't me
---------------------------------------------------
Now here you go again
You say you want your freedom
Well, who am I to keep you down?
It's only right that you should
Play the way you feel it
But listen carefully to the sound
Of your loneliness

Like a heartbeat... drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost...
And what you had...
And what you lost

Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Say... Women... they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean... you'll know, you'll know

Now here I go again, I see the crystal visions
I keep my visions to myself
It's only me
Who wants to wrap around your dreams and...
Have you any dreams you'd like to sell?
Dreams of loneliness...

Like a heartbeat... drives you mad...
In the stillness of remembering what you had...
And what you lost...
And what you had...
And what you lost

Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Women they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know

Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Say women they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know, you'll know
You will know, you'll know
---------------------------------------------------
What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawin' me in and you kickin' me out
You've got my head spinnin', no kiddin'
I can't pin you down
What's goin' on in that beautiful mind?
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me
But I'll be alright

My head's under water, but I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginnin'
Even when I lose, I'm winnin'

'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh

How many times do I have to tell you?
Even when you're crying, you're beautiful too
The world is beating you down, I'm around
Through every mood
You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing
In my head for you

My head's under water, but I'm breathin' fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginnin'
Even when I lose, I'm winnin'

'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh

Give me all of you, oh
Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts
Risking it all, though it's hard

'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginnin'
Even when I lose, I'm winnin'

'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you

I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh
---------------------------------------------------
You've been my muse for a long time
You get me through every dark night
I'm always gone, out on the go
I'm on the run and you're home alone
I'm too consumed with my own life

Are we too young for this?
Feels like I can't move

Sharing my heart
It's tearing me apart
But I know I'd miss you, baby, if I left right now
Doing what I can, tryna be a man
And every time I kiss you, baby
I can hear the sound of breaking down

I've been confused as of late (Yeah)
Watching my youth slip away (Yeah)
You're like the sun, you wake me up
But you drain me out if I get too much
I might need you or I'll break

Are we too young for this?
Feels like I can't move

Sharing my heart
It's tearing me apart
But I know I'd miss you, baby, if I left right now
Doing what I can, tryna be a man
And every time I kiss you, baby
I can hear the sound of breaking down

Breaking down, breaking down, breaking down
Breaking down, breaking down, breaking down

I don't want to play this part
But I do all for you
I don't want to make this hard
But I will 'cause I'm still

Sharing my heart
It's tearing me apart
But I know I'd miss you, baby, if I left right now (I know I would)
Doing what I can, tryna be a man (Be your man)
And every time I kiss you, baby
I can hear the sound of breaking down

Sharing my bed, uh
Sharing my bread, yeah
Sharing my bread
Sharing my head
(I'm breaking down)
Sharing my heart
Sharing my, suddenly I'm
(Breaking down)
Sharing, I'm done
Sharing my life

I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang

I was told when I get older all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure and I care what people think

My name's 'Blurryface' and I care what you think
My name's 'Blurryface' and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time, to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out (oh)
Wish we could turn back time (oh), to the good old days (oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out

We're stressed out

Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from
I'd make a candle out of it if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one

It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes homegrown a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and tree-house homes we all would take the latter

My name's 'Blurryface' and I care what you think
My name's 'Blurryface' and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time, to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out (oh)
Wish we could turn back time (oh), to the good old days (oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out

We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face
Saying, "Wake up, you need to make money."
Yeah

We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face
Saying, "Wake up, you need to make money."
Yeah

Wish we could turn back time, to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out (oh)
Wish we could turn back time (oh), to the good old days (oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out

Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face
Saying, "Wake up, you need to make money."
Yeah

The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go (mmmm)
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow (mmmm)
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now (mmmm)
Take my hand, stop, put Van The Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance
And now I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead (mmmm)

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body

Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date (mmmm)
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate (mmmm)
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay (mmmm)
And leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play
And I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead (mmmm)

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body

Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body

Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

Flowers in hand, waiting for me
Every word in poetry
Won't call me by name, only "Baby"
The more that you give the less that I
Need everyone says I look happy
When it feels right

I know that you're wrong for me
Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave
I brought you down to your knees
'Cause they say that misery loves company
It's not your fault I ruin everything
And it's not your fault I can't be what you need
Baby, angels like you can't fly down hell with me
I'm everything they said I would be
La-la-la
I'm everything they said I would be

I'll put you down slow, love you, goodbye
Before you let go, just one more time
Take off your clothes, pretend that it's fine
A little more hurt won't kill you
Tonight my mom says, "You don't look happy"
Close your eyes

I know that you're wrong for me
Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave
I brought you down to your knees
'Cause they say that misery loves company
It's not your fault I ruin everything
And it's not your fault I can't be what you need
Baby, angels like you can't fly down hell with me
I'm everything they said I would be

I know that you're wrong for me
Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave
I brought you down to your knees
'Cause they say that misery loves company
It's not your fault I ruin everything
And it's not your fault I can't be what you need
Baby, angels like you can't fly down hell with me, oh-oh
Angels like you can't fly down hell with me
---------------------------------------------------
All I want to get is a little bit closer
All I want to know is, can you come a little closer?

Here comes the breath before we get a little bit closer
Here comes the rush before we touch, come a little closer

The doors are open, the wind is really blowing
The night sky is changing overhead

It's not just all physical
I'm the type who won't get oh so critical
So let's make things physical
I won't treat you like you're oh so typical
I won't treat you like you're oh so typical

All you think of lately is getting underneath me
All I dream of lately is how to get you underneath me

Here comes the heat before we meet a little bit closer
Here comes the spark before the dark, come a little closer

The lights are off and the sun is finally setting
The night sky is changing overhead

It's not just all physical
I'm the type who won't get oh so critical
So let's make things physical
I won't treat you like you're oh so typical

I want you close, I want you
I won't treat you like you're typical
I want you close, I want you
I won't treat you like you're typical

Here come the dreams of you and me
Here come the dreams
Here come the dreams of you and me
Here come the dreams

It's not just all physical
I'm the type who won't get oh so critical
So let's make things physical
I won't treat you like you're oh so typical

I want you close, I want you
I won't treat you like you're typical
I want you close, I want you
I won't treat you like you're typical

I won't treat you like you're typical
I won't treat you like you're typical

All I want to get is a little bit closer
All I want to know is, can you come a little closer?

Once upon a younger year
When all our shadows disappeared
The animals inside came out to play
Went face to face with all our fears
Learned our lessons through the tears
Made memories we knew would never fade

One day my father—he told me
"Son, don't let it slip away"
He took me in his arms, I heard him say

"When you get older
Your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid"

He said, "One day you'll leave this world behind
So, live a life you will remember"
My father told me when I was just a child
"These are the nights that never die"
My father told me

"When thunder clouds start pouring down
Light a fire they can't put out
Carve your name into those shining stars"
He said, "Go venture far beyond the shores
Don't forsake this life of yours
I'll guide you home no matter where you are"

One day my father—he told me
"Son, don't let it slip away"
When I was just a kid I heard him say

"When you get older
Your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid"

He said, "One day you'll leave this world behind
So, live a life you will remember"
My father told me when I was just a child
"These are the nights that never die"
My father told me

"These are the nights that never die"
My father told me
My father told me
---------------------------------------------------
This night is cold in the kingdom
I can feel you fade away
From the kitchen to the bathroom sink and
Your steps keep me awake

Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
I once was a man with dignity and grace
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
So please, please

Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me

If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly

Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down
Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down

If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly

Cold skin, drag my feet on the tile
As I'm walking down the corridor
And I know we haven't talked in a while
So I'm looking for an open door

Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
I once was a man with dignity and grace
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
So please, please

Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me

If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly

Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down
Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down

If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly

And I can't stop myself from falling down
And I can't stop myself from falling down
And I can't stop myself from falling down
And I can't stop myself from falling down

Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me

If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly

Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down
Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down

If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly

If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly

Hey
He-e-e-e-ey
He-e-e-e-ey

Your lipstick stains
On the front lobe of my left-side brains
I knew I wouldn't forget you
And so I went and let you blow my mind
Your sweet moonbeam
The smell of you in every single dream I dream
I knew when we collided
You're the one I have decided who's one of my kind

Hey, soul sister
Ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair, you know
Hey, soul sister
I don't wanna miss a single thing you do
Tonight

Hey
He-e-e-e-ey
He-e-e-e-ey

Just in time
I'm so glad you have a one-track mind like me
You gave my life direction
A game-show love connection we can't deny
I'm so obsessed
My heart is bound to beat right out my untrimmed chest
I believe in you, like a virgin, you're Madonna
And I'm always gonna wanna blow your mind

Hey, soul sister
Ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair, you know
Hey, soul sister
I don't wanna miss a single thing you do
Tonight

The way you can cut a rug
Watching you's the only drug I need
So gangster, I'm so thug
You're the only one I'm dreaming of, you see
I can be myself now finally
In fact, there's nothing I can't be
I want the world to see you'll be with me

Hey, soul sister
Ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair, you know
Hey, soul sister
I don't wanna miss a single thing you do tonight
Hey, soul sister
I don't wanna miss a single thing you do
Tonight

Hey
He-e-e-e-ey
He-e-e-e-ey
Tonight
Hey
He-e-e-e-ey
He-e-e-e-ey
Tonight

One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me

I look like all you need

Let me take the night, I love real easy
And I know that you'll still wanna see me
On the Sunday morning, music real loud
Let me love you while the moon is still out

Something in you
Lit up heaven in me
The feeling won't let me sleep
'Cause I'm lost in the way you move, the way you feel

One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me

Someone said they left together
I ran out the door to get her
She was holding hands with Trevor
Not the greatest feeling ever
Said, "Pull yourself together
You should try your luck with Heather"
Then I heard they slept together
Oh, the less I know the better
The less I know the better

Oh my love, can't you see yourself by my side
No surprise when you're on his shoulder like every night
Oh my love, can't you see that you're on my mind
Don't suppose you could convince your lover to change his mind
So goodbye

She said, "It's not now or never
Wait 10 years, we'll be together"
I said, "Better late than never
Just don't make me wait forever"
Don't make me wait forever
Don't make me wait forever

Oh my love, can't you see yourself by my side?
I don't suppose you could convince your lover to change his mind

I was doing fine without ya
'Til I saw your face, now I can't erase
Giving in to all his bullshit
Is this what you want, is this who you are?
I was doing fine without ya
'Til I saw your eyes turn away from mine
Oh, sweet darling, where he wants you
Said, "Come on Superman, say your stupid line"
Said, "Come on Superman, say your stupid line"
Said, "Come on Superman, say your stupid line"

Peace up, A-Town down
Yeah, yeah! Okay, okay!
Usher (Usher, Usher, Usher, Usher)
Lil Jon
Let's go!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Let's go!

I was up in the club with my homies
Tryna get a lil' V-I
Keep it down on the low-key (Low-key)
'Cause you know how it feels (Hey!)
I seen shorty, she was checkin' up on me
From the game she was spitting in my ear
You would think that she know me (Know me)
I decided to chill (Okay!)
Conversation got heavy (Hey!)
She had me feeling like she's ready to blow (Watch out!)
Oh! (Watch out)
She's saying, "Come get me" (Come get me)
So I got up and followed her to the floor
She said, "Baby, let's go"
When I told her (Let's go!), I said

(Yeah!) Yeah!
Shawty got down low, she said, "come and get me"
(Yeah!) Yeah!
I got so caught up, I forgot she told me
(Yeah!) Yeah!
Her and my girl, they used to be the best of homies
(Yeah!) Yeah!
Next thing I knew, she was all up on me, screaming
Yeah (Yeah!) yeah (Yeah!) yeah, yeah!
Yeah (Yeah!) yeah (Yeah!) yeah, yeah!

So she's all up in my head now, got me thinking
That it might be a good idea to take her with me
'Cause she's ready to leave (Ready to leave now) (Let's go!)
And I got to keep it real now
'Cause on a one to ten, she's a certified twenty
But that just ain't me (Hey!)
'Cause I don't know, if I take that chance
Just where's it gonna lead?
But what I do know is the way she dance
Make shorty alright with me
The way she get low
I'm like, yeah, just work that out for me
She asks for one more dance, and I'm like, yeah
How the hell am I supposed to leave?
(Let's go, bring the beat back!) And I say

(Yeah!) Yeah!
Shawty got down low, she said, "come and get me"
(Yeah!) Yeah!
I got so caught up, I forgot she told me
(Yeah!) Yeah!
Her and my girl, they used to be the best of homies
(Yeah!) Yeah!
Next thing I knew, she was all up on me, screaming
Yeah (Yeah!) yeah (Yeah!) yeah, yeah!
Yeah (Yeah!) yeah (Yeah!) yeah, yeah!
(Hey! Hey! Luda!)


Watch out, my outfit's ridiculous
In the club, looking so conspicuous
And these women all on the prowl
If you hold the head steady, I'ma milk the cow (Yeah!)
And forget about game, I'ma spit the truth (What?)
I won't stop 'til I get 'em in their birthday suit (Yeah!)
So gimme the rhythm and it'll be off with their clothes
Then bend over to the front, and touch your toes
I left the Jag and I took the Rolls
If they ain't cutting, then I put 'em on foot patrol (Let's go!)
How you like me now?
When my pinky's valued over three hundred thousand
Let's drink, you the one to please (Yeah!)
Ludacris fill cups like double Ds (Yeah!)
Me and Ursh' once more, and we leaves 'em dead
We want a lady in the street, but a freak in the bed, that say

(Yeah!) Yeah!
Shawty got down low, she said, "come and get me"
(Yeah!) Yeah!
I got so caught up, I forgot she told me
(Yeah!) Yeah!
Her and my girl, they used to be the best of homies
(Yeah!) Yeah!
Next thing I knew, she was all up on me, screaming
Yeah (Yeah!) yeah (Yeah!) yeah, yeah!
Yeah (Yeah!) yeah (Yeah!) yeah, yeah!


Take that and rewind it back
Lil Jon got the beat that make your booty go (Clap)
Take that, rewind it back
Ursher got the voice make your booty go (Clap)
Take that, rewind it back
Ludacris got the flow to make your booty go (Clap)
Take that, rewind it back
Lil Jon got the beat that make your booty go (Clap)

I miss the taste of a sweeter life
I miss the conversation
I'm searching for a song tonight
I'm changing all of the stations

I like to think that we had it all
We drew a map to a better place
But on that road I took a fall
Oh, baby, why did you run away?

I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest nights

But I wonder, where were you
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back?
So I wonder, where were you
When all the roads you took came back to me?

So I'm following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following

I hear your voice in my sleep at night
Hard to resist temptation
'Cause something strange has come over me
And now I can't get over you
No, I just can't get over you, ooh

I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest nights

But I wonder where were you
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back?
So I wonder where were you
When all the roads you took came back to me?

So I'm following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Yeah yeah yeah
Oh oh oh

Oh, I was there for you
Oh, in your darkest times
Oh, I was there for you
Oh, in your darkest nights

Oh, I was there for you
Oh, in your darkest times
Oh, I was there for you
Oh, in your darkest nights

But I wonder, where were you
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back?
So I wonder, where were you
When all the roads you took came back to me?

So I'm following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you

I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around

And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?

And I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever now I drive alone past your street

And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do
Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you

And I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one
Oh, and I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever now I drive alone past your street

Red lights
Stop signs
I still see your face
In the white cars
Front yards
Can't drive past the places
We used to
Go to
'Cause I still fucking love you, babe

Sidewalks
We crossed
I still hear your voice
In the traffic
We're laughing
Over all the noise
God, I'm so blue
Know we're through
But I still fucking love you, babe

I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever now I drive alone past your street
Yeah, you said forever now I drive alone past your street
---------------------------------------------------

Like I ain't got the pictures of you beggin' for forgiveness (Yeah)
I ain't gotta do the most, I know what the real is (I know what the real is)
Ain't the jealous type, please don't believe the hype (Please)
You can't make me mad with some shit that I'ma like (That I'ma like)
Don't mean to be intrusive, but you thinkin' you exclusive
When a party ain't a party if my bitches ain't included (Ah, ah)

---------------------------------------------------
Walking down 29th and park
I saw you in another's arms
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier

Saw you walk inside a bar
He said something to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah you look happier, you do

Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal baby
If you're moving on with someone new

Cause baby you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you

Sat in the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself you're happier
Aren't you?

Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody need you like I do
I know that there's others that deserve you
But my darling I am still in love with you

But I guess you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
I could try to smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you

Baby you look happier, you do
I knew one day you'd fall for someone new
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do
Just know that I'll be waiting here for you
---------------------------------------------------
Listen, baby
Ain't no mountain high
Ain't no valley low
Ain't no river wide enough, baby

If you need me, call me
No matter where you are
No matter how far (don't worry, baby)
Just call my name
I'll be there in a hurry
You don't have to worry
Cause baby there

Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you, babe

Remember the day
I set you free
I told you you could always count on me, darling
From that day on, I made a vow
I'll be there when you want me
Some way, some how
Cause baby there

Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you, babe

Oh no, darling

No wind, no rain
Nor winter's cold
Can't stop me baby

No no baby

Cause you are my goal

If you're ever in trouble
I'll be there on the double
Just send for me

Oh baby!

My love is alive
Way down in my heart
Although we are miles apart

If you ever need a helping hand
I'll be there on the double
Just as fast as I can

Don't you know that there...

Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you babe

Don't you know that there...

Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
---------------------------------------------------
Am I throwin' you off?
Nope
Didn't think so

How you doin', young lady?
That feeling that you giving really drives me crazy
You don't, have a player 'bout to choke
I was at a loss for words first time that we spoke
You're lookin' for a girl that'll treat you right?
How you're lookin' for her in the daytime with the light?
You might be the type if I play my cards right
I'll find out by the end of the night
You expect me to just let you hit it?
But will you still respect me if you get it?
All I can do is try, gimme one chance (Chance)
What's the problem? I don't see no ring on your hand (Hand)
I'll be the first to admit it
I'm curious about you, you seem so innocent
You wanna get in my world, get lost in it?
Boy, I'm tired of runnin', let's walk for a minute

Promiscuous girl, wherever you are
I'm all alone, and it's you that I want
Promiscuous boy, you already know
That I'm all yours, what you waiting for?
Promiscuous girl, you're teasin' me
You know what I want, and I got what you need
Promiscuous boy, let's get to the point
'Cause we're on a roll, you ready?

Roses are red, some diamonds are blue
Chivalry is dead, but you're still kinda cute
Hey, I can't keep my mind off you
Where you at? Do you mind if I come through?
I'm out of this world, come with me to my planet
Get you on my level, do you think that you can handle it?
They call me Thomas, last name Crown
Recognize game, I'ma lay mines down
I'm a big girl, I can handle myself
But if I get lonely, I'ma need your help
Pay attention to me, I don't talk for my health
I want you on my team
So does everybody else
Shh, baby, we can keep it on the low (Low)
Let your guard down, ain't nobody gotta know (Know)
If you with it, girl, I know a place we can go
What kind of girl do you take me for?

Promiscuous girl, wherever you are
I'm all alone, and it's you that I want
Promiscuous boy, you already know
That I'm all yours, what you waiting for?
Promiscuous girl, you're teasin' me
You know what I want, and I got what you need
Promiscuous boy, let's get to the point
'Cause we're on a roll, you ready?

Don't be mad, don't get mean
Don't get mad, don't be mean
Hey, don't be mad, don't get mean
Don't get mad, don't be mean

Wait, I don't mean no harm
I can see you with my T-shirt on
I can see you with nothin' on
Feelin' on me before you bring that on
Bring that on?!
You know what I mean
Girl, I'm a freak, you shouldn't say those things
I'm only trying to get inside of your brain
To see if you can work me the way you say
It's OK, it's alright
I got something that you gon' like
Hey, is that the truth or are you talking trash?
Is your game M.V.P. like Steve Nash?

Promiscuous girl, wherever you are
I'm all alone, and it's you that I want
Promiscuous boy, I'm callin' your name
But you're drivin' me crazy the way you're makin' me wait
Promiscuous girl, you're teasin' me
You know what I want, and I got what you need
Promiscuous boy, we're one and the same
So we don't gotta play games no more
---------------------------------------------------
Know that I loved you so bad
I let you treat me like that
I was your willing accomplice, honey

And I watched as you fled the scene
Doe-eyed as you buried me
One heart broke, four hands bloody

The things I did
Just so I could call you mine
The things you did
Well, I hope I was your favorite crime

You used me as an alibi
I crossed my heart as you crossed the line
And I defended you to all my friends

And now, every time a siren sounds
I wonder if you're around
'Cause you know that I'd do it all again

Oh, the things I did
Just so I could call you mine
The things you did
Well, I hope I was your favorite crime

It's bittersweet to think about the damage that we'd do
'Cause I was going down, but I was doing it with you
Yeah, everything we broke, and all the trouble that we made
But I say that I hate you with a smile on my face

Oh, look what we became

Oh, the things I did
Just so I could call you mine
Oh, the things you did
Well, I hope I was your favorite crime

Your favorite crime
Your favorite crime
'Cause baby, you were mine
---------------------------------------------------
Ay, ay, ay
Good to see you, come on in, let's go
Yeah, let's go
Ha-ha-ha-ha
Alright, alright
OK, uh, alright, OK
Alright, OK

Return of the Mack, get up!
What it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn't
Looking for a better way to get up out of bed
Instead of getting on the Internet and checking on who hit me

Get up! Thrift shop, pimp-strut walking, little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby. Sweater game, nope, nope y'all can't copy

Yup. Bad, moon-walking, this here is our party, my posse's been on Broadway
And we did it our way
Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones into everything I record to it
And yet I'm on

Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and Plinko in my style

Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town

Trust me. On my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit, hustling
Chasing dreams since I was fourteen with the four-track bussing
Halfway cross that city with the backpack, fat cat, crush shit

Labels out here
Nah, they can't tell me nothing (Hey, hey, hey)
We give that to the people
Spread it across the country (Hey, hey, hey)
Labels out here
Nah, they can't tell me nothing (Hey, hey, hey)
We give it to the people
Spread it across the country (Hey, hey, hey)

Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Nah, can I kick it? Thank you. Yeah I'm so damn grateful
I grew up, really wanted gold fronts
But that's what you get when Wu-Tang raised you

Y'all can't stop me, go hard like I got a 808 in my heart beat
And I'm eating at the beat like you give a little speed to a great white shark on Shark Week

Raw. Time to go off. I'm gone
Deuces goodbye. I got a world to see, and my girl she wanna see Rome
Caesar'll make you a believer

Nah I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes from giving it back to the people
Nah sing this song and it goes like

"Raise those hands, this is our party
We came here to live life like nobody was watching"
I got my city right behind me
If I fall, they got me
Learn from that failure gain humility and then we keep marching. I said

Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

And so we put our hands up
And so we put our hands up

Wa oh oh oh wa oh oh oh wa oh oh
Let's go!

Na na na na na na na na (aha)
Hey
And all my people say

Na na na na na na na na (that's right, feels good)
Hey
And all my people say

Na na na na na na na na (it's alright)
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
And all my people say

Na na na na na na na na
Mack-le-le-le-le-le-more


Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Shady


Konvict, Upfront
Akon, Slim Shady
I see the one, could she be that lady? Ay

I feel you creepin', I can see it from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo?
And possibly bend you over?

Look back and watch me smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Upfront style, ready to attack now
Pull in the parking lot slow with the 'Lac down
Konvict's got the whole thing packed now
Step in the club, the wardrobe intact now
I feel it, dawnin' cracked now
Ooh, I see it dull and backed now
I'ma call her, then I put the mack down
Money no problem, pocket full of that now

I feel you creepin', I can see it from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo?
And possibly bend you over?

Look back and watch me smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh


Oh, looks like another club banger
They better hang on when they throw this thang on
Get a little drink on, they gon' flip
For this Akon shit, you can bank on it
Pedicure, manicure, kitty-cat claws
The way she climbs up and down them poles
Lookin' like one of them Putty-Cat Dolls
Tryin' to hold my woodie back through my drawers
Steps off stage, didn't think I saw her
Creeps up behind me, and she's like "You're—"
I'm like, "I know, let's cut to the chase
No time to waste, back to my place"
Plus from the club to the crib's like a mile away
Or more like a palace, shall I say
And plus, I got a pal if your gal is game
In fact, he's the one singin' the song that's playin' (Akon!)


I feel you creepin', I can see it from my shadow (My shadow)
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo? (Like Tae Bo?)
And possibly bend you over? (Ooh, yeah)

Look back and watch me smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more (Yeah)
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Yeah, yeah)

Eminem's rollin', D and 'em rollin'
Bu and all marvelous, them rollin'
Women just ho-in', big booty rollin'
Soon, I'll be all in them and throwin' D (D)
Hittin' no less than three (Three)
Block wheel style like whee (Whee)
Girl, I can tell you want me, 'cause lately

I feel you creepin', I can see it from my shadow (Yeah, my shadow)
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo? (Like Tae Bo?)
And possibly bend you over? (Ooh, yeah)

Look back and watch me smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Don't you know I'm no good for you?
I've learned to lose you can't afford to
Tore my shirt to stop you bleeding
But nothing ever stops you leaving

Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

Don't you know too much already?
I'll only hurt you if you let me
Call me friend, but keep me closer
(Call me back)
And I'll call you when the party's over

Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
Yeah, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

But nothing is better, sometimes
Once we've both said our goodbyes
Let's just let it go
Let me let you go

Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

My lover's got humour
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner

If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week

"We were born sick," you heard them say it

My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, "Worship in the bedroom"
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you

I was born sick
But I love it
Command me to be well
Aaay. Amen. Amen. Amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the Goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice

Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine-looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful

That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

No Masters or Kings
When the Ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin

In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human
Only then I am clean
Ooh oh. Amen. Amen. Amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

It's going down, I'm yelling timber
You better move, you better dance
Let's make a night you won't remember
I'll be the one you won't forget

Whoa (timber), whoa (timber), whoa (it's going down)
Whoa (timber), whoa (timber), whoa (it's going down)


The bigger they are, the harder they fall
These big-iddy boys are dig-gidy dogs
I have 'em like Miley Cyrus, clothes off
Twerking in their bras and thongs, timber
Face down, booty up, timber
That's the way we like to–what?–timber
I'm slicker than an oil spill
She say she won't, but I bet she will, timber

Swing your partner 'round and 'round
End of the night, it's going down
One more shot, another round
End of the night, it's going down
Swing your partner 'round and 'round
End of the night, it's going down
One more shot, another round
End of the night, it's going down

Whoa (timber), whoa (timber), whoa (it's going down)
Whoa (timber), whoa (timber), whoa (it's going down)


Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
Nah, it's just me, ain't a damn thing changed
Live in hotels, swing on planes
Blessed to say, money ain't a thing
Club jumping like LeBron now, Voli
Order me another round, homie
We about to clown. Why? 'Cause it's about to go down

Swing your partner 'round and 'round
End of the night, it's going down
One more shot, another round

This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the earth move and then
Hear my heart burst again

For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall
That skyfall

Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number, you can take my name
But you'll never have my heart

Let the sky fall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together

Let the sky fall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together
At skyfall


(Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall)

Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know I'd never be me
Without the security
Of your loving arms
Keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand

Let the sky fall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together

Let the sky fall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together
At skyfall

Let the sky fall
We will stand tall
At skyfall
Oh-s...

As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
'Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long, that
Even my momma thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how you talkin' and where you walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke, fool
I'm the kinda G the little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the streetlight

Been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise

Look at the situation they got me facin'
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the state
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watchin' got me chasin' dreams
I'm a educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set trippin' banger
And my homies is down so don't arouse my anger
Fool, death ain't nothin' but a heart beat away
I'm livin' life do or die, what can I say?
I'm 23 now, but will I live to see 24?
The way things is goin' I don't know

Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?

Been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise

Power and the money, money and the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's runnin', but half of them ain't lookin'
It's goin' on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'
They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
I guess they can't, I guess they won't
I guess they frontin', that's why I know my life is out of luck, fool!

Been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise

Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?
Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?

Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy (ooh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ohh (ooh)
Ayy, ayy
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ohh

Needless to say, I keep in check
She was a bad-bad, nevertheless (yeah)
Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck (wreck)
Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck (wreck)

Needless to say, I'm keepin' in check
She was a bad-bad, nevertheless
Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck
Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck

Thinkin' in a bad way, losin' your grip
Screamin' at my face, baby, don't trip
Someone took a big L, don't know how that felt
Lookin' at you sideways, party on tilt

Ooh-ooh
Some things you just can't refuse
She wanna ride me like a cruise
And I'm not tryna lose

Then you're left in the dust
Unless I stuck by ya
You're a sunflower
I think your love would be too much
Or you'll be left in the dust
Unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower
You're the sunflower


Every time I'm leavin' on you
You don't make it easy, no, no
Wish I could be there for you
Give me a reason to, oh, oh

Every time I'm walkin' out
I can hear you tellin' me to turn around
Fightin' for my trust and you won't back down
Even if we gotta risk it all right now, oh

I know you're scared of the unknown (-known)
You don't wanna be alone (alone)
I know I always come and go (and go)
But it's out of my control

And you'll be left in the dust
Unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower
I think your love would be too much
Or you'll be left in the dust
Unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower
You're the sunflower
Yeah
---------------------------------------------------
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffing paint and I love her the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
She fucking hates me and I love it
"Wait! Where you going?"
"I'm leaving you!"
"No you ain't. Come back"
We're running right back
Here we go again
It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed I snap
"Who's that dude?"
"I don't even know his name"
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em
You meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feeling
Yeah, them chills used to get 'em
Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at 'em
You swore you'd never hit 'em; never do nothing to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face spewing venom in your words when you spit them
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em
So lost in the moments when you're in them
It's the rage that took over
It controls you both
So they say it's best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know you 'cause today that was yesterday
Yesterday is over, it's a different day
Sound like broken records playing over but you promised her
Next time you'd show restraint
You don't get another chance
Life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Now I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
And we fall back into the same patterns, same routines
But your temper's just as bad as mine is
You're the same as me
When it comes to love you're just as blinded
Baby, please come back
It wasn't you, baby it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk
Told you this is my fault
Look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games I just want her back
I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fucking leave again
I'mma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
I'm just gonna

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
---------------------------------------------------
I fell by the wayside like everyone else
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you
But I was just kidding myself
Our every moment, I start to replace
'Cause now that they're gone
All I hear are the words that I needed to say

When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal but this won't

So, before you go
Was there something I could've said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go

Was never the right time whenever you called
Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all
Our every moment, I start to replay
But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face

When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal but this won't

So, before you go
Was there something I could've said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go

Would we be better off by now
If I'd have let my walls come down
Maybe I guess we'll never know
You know
You know

Before you go
Was there something I could've said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go
---------------------------------------------------
She was a fast machine, she kept her motor clean
She was the best damn woman that I ever seen
She had the sightless eyes, telling me no lies
Knocking me out with those American thighs
Taking more than her share, had me fighting for air
She told me to come, but I was already there
'Cause the walls start shaking, the Earth was quaking
My mind was aching, and we were making it

And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me all night long

Working double-time on the seduction line
She's one of a kind, she's just a-mine all mine
Wanted no applause, just another course
Made a meal outta me, and come back for more
Had to cool me down to take another round
Now, I'm back in the ring to take another swing
That the walls were shaking, the Earth was quaking
My mind was aching, and we were making it

And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me all night long
It knocked me out that
You shook me all night long
It had me shaking
And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me
Well, you took me

You really took me and
You shook me all night long
Ah, you shook me all night long
Yeah, yeah, you shook me all night long
You really got me and you, shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me
Yeah, you shook me
All night long
---------------------------------------------------
Every night
I take myself to where the skies are blue
To where we swam when I met you

Stay here
I spent the best days of my life with you
Watching clouds form in the distance
I watched the sunset on the beach with you
It's not over yet

I want your love
And I want it bad
I just wanna treat you better
I just wanna treat you better
I want your love
And I want it bad
I just wanna treat you better
I just wanna treat you better

Let's begin again
Let's get back to where we started
When there was talk of getting older
I'll be waiting by the water
Let's start over

I want your love
And I want it bad
I just wanna treat you better
I just wanna treat you better
I want your love
And I want it bad
I just wanna treat you better
I just wanna treat you better

I know that the words don't change it
I know that your heart keeps aching
I just wanna treat you better
I just wanna treat you better
Even when the light can't find me
I know that the sun keeps shining
I just wanna treat you better
I just wanna treat you better
Oh, I just wanna treat you better
I just wanna treat you better
I just wanna treat you better
I just wanna treat you better

I want your love
And I want it bad
I just wanna treat you better
I just wanna treat you better
I want your love
And I want it bad
I just wanna treat you better
I just wanna treat you better
---------------------------------------------------
I could lift you up
I could show you what you wanna see
And take you where you wanna be

You could be my luck
Even if the sky is falling down
I know that we'll be safe and sound

We're safe and sound

I could fill your cup
You know my river won't evaporate
This world we still appreciate

You could be my luck
Even in a hurricane of frowns
I know that we'll be safe and sound

Safe and sound
We're safe and sound
Safe and sound
We're safe and sound
Hold your ground
We're safe and sound
Safe and sound

I could show you love
In a tidal wave of mystery
You'll still be standing next to me

You could be my luck
Even if we're six feet underground
I know that we'll be safe and sound

We're safe and sound

Safe and sound
Safe and sound
Hold your ground
Safe and sound

I could lift you up
I could show you what you wanna see
And take you where you wanna be

You could be my luck
Even if the sky is falling down
I know that we'll be safe and sound

I could lift you up
I could show you what you wanna see
And take you where you wanna be

You could be my luck
Even if the sky is falling down
I know that we'll be safe and sound

We're safe and sound
We're safe and sound
We're safe and sound
We're safe and sound

Safe and sound
We're safe and sound
Safe and sound
We're safe and sound
Hold your ground
We're safe and sound
Safe and sound
We're safe and sound

Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive

It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Shine a light through an open door
Love and life I will divide
Turn away 'cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind

It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine (mine, mine, mine)

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Pensaba que te habia olvidado
Pero pusieron la cancion
Que cantamos bien borrachos
Que bailamos bien borrachos
Nos besamos bien borrachos los dos

Pensaba que te habia olvidado
Pero pusieron la cancion
Que cantamos bien borrachos
Que bailamos bien borrachos
Nos besamos bien borrachos los dos

Pensaba que te habia olvidado

Justo cuando creia que por comerme a dos o diez
Te olvidaria, cogi un respiro y me sali de la via
Y como un pendejo no sabia lo que hacia
Nunca lo supere, nunca te supere
Hasta me aprendi to'as las baladas en Ingles
Respire y conte hasta tres eres la fantasia oscura de Kanye West

Bebe hey
Hace tiempo lo barato me salio caro
Ya solo Twiteo o a la loca disparo
¿Como olvidar lo bella que era en el carro?
La que aqui yo solo

Pensaba que te habia olvidado
Pero pusieron la cancion
Que cantamos bien borrachos
Que bailamos bien borrachos
Nos besamos bien borrachos los dos

Pensaba que te habia olvidado
Pero pusieron la cancion
Que cantamos bien borrachos
Que bailamos bien borrachos
Nos besamos bien borrachos los dos

Y hace tiempo
Que no venias a mi cabeza
Pero ya van par de cervezas
Y me acorde de como tu me besas
De todos los polvos encima de la mesa
En el carro, en la playa y el motel
En casa de tu pa' y cuando yo te iba a ver
Las veces que tu Mai nos llego a coger
Tu brincando moja'ita sudando Chanel
Yo se que lo nuestro es cosa de ayer
Y me pone contento que te va bien con el
Yo ni te extranaba ni te queria ver
Pero pusieron la cancion que te gustaba poner
Y me acorde ti, cuando me hiciste feliz
Se acabo pues me fui, yo mismo me rio de mi, porque

Pensaba que te habia olvidado
Pero pusieron la cancion
Que cantamos bien borrachos
Que bailamos bien borrachos
Nos besamos bien borrachos los dos

Y yo pensaba que tu nombre estaba muerto
Pero te sone despierto
Ey, hoy sali pa' la calle suelto
Sin sentimiento el corazon desierto

Y yo pensaba que tu nombre estaba muerto
Pero te sone despierto
Hoy sali pa' la calle suelto
Sin sentimiento el corazon desierto

Record man play my song on the radio
You too busy tryna find that blue-eyed soul
I let my black hair grow and my weed smoke
And I swear too much on the regular
We gon' let them hits fly, we gon' let it go
If it ain't XO, then it gotta go
I just won a new award for a kids show
Talkin' 'bout a face numbin' off a bag of blow
I'm like, goddamn, bitch, I am not a Teen Choice
Goddamn, bitch, I am not a bleach boy
Whip game, make a nigga understand though
Got that Hannibal, Silence of the Lambo
Hit the gas so hard make it rotate
All my niggas blew up like a propane
All these R&B niggas be so lame
Got a sweet Asian chick, she go lo mein (Oh-oh-oh)

You know me (Know me, uh, na-na-na-na-na)
You know me (Know me, know me, oh-oh-oh)
You know me (Know me, know me, na-na-na-na-na)
Every time you try to forget who I am
I'll be right there to remind you again
You know me (Pow, pow)
You know me (Know me)

Said I'm just tryna swim in somethin' wetter than the ocean
Faded off a double cup, I'm mixin' up the potion
All I wanna do is make that money and make dope shit
It just seem like niggas tryna sound like all my old shit
Everybody knows it, all these niggas know me
Platinum off a mixtape, sippin' on that codeine
Pour it in my trophies, roll until my nose bleed
I'ma keep on singin' while I'm burnin' up that OG
All my niggas get it, they make money all alone
Rock a chain around they neck, makin' sure I'm gettin' home
When I travel 'round the globe, make a couple mil' a show
And I come back to my city, I fuck every girl I know
Used to walk 'round with a slouch, had a mattress on the floor
Now my shit straight, eatin' all day, tryna lose weight
That good sex, we'll sweat it out
Hotel bed springs, we'll wear it out
I ain't gotta tell you

'Cause you know me (Oh-oh-oh)
You know me (Know me, ah, na-na-na-na-na)
You know me (Know me, know me, oh-oh-oh)
You know me (Know me, know me, na-na-na-na-na)
Every time you try to forget who I am (Try to forget who I am)
I'll be right there to remind you again (Hey)
You know me (Pow, pow)
You know me (Know me, know me)

Why don't you shake somethin', shake somethin'
For the Don? Don't you break nothin', break nothin'
Baby girl, won't you work somethin', work somethin'
For the Don? Don't you hurt nothin', hurt nothin'
Baby girl, won't you shake somethin', shake somethin' (Shake some)
For the Don? Don't you break nothin' (Break nothin'), break nothin'
Baby girl, won't you work somethin' (Work), work somethin'
For the Don? Don't you hurt nothin', hurt nothin'

'Cause you know me
Girl, you know me
You already know me
Yeah, you know me

Oh-oh-oh, na-na-na-na-na
Oh-oh-oh, na-na-na-na-na
Oh-oh-oh, na-na-na-na-na
Oh-oh-oh, na-na-na-na-na
---------------------------------------------------
It's not in the way that you hold me
It's not in the way you say you care
It's not in the way you've been treating my friends
It's not in the way that you stayed 'til the end
It's not in the way you look or the things that you say that you'll do

Hold the line
Love isn't always on time
Hold the line
Love isn't always on time

It's not in the words that you told me
It's not in the way you say you're mine
It's not in the way that you came back to me
It's not in the way that your love set me free
It's not in the way you look or the things that you say that you'll do

Hold the line
Love isn't always on time
Hold the line
Love isn't always on time

It's not in the words that you told me
It's not in the way you say you're mine
It's not in the way that you came back to me
It's not in the way that your love set me free
It's not in the way you look or the things that you say that you'll do

Hold the line
Love isn't always on time
Hold the line
Love isn't always on time
Love isn't always on time
Hold the line
Love isn't always on time
Love isn't always on time
Love isn't always on time
Hold the line
Love isn't always on time
Love isn't always on time
Love isn't always on time
Love isn't always on time
Whoa-ooh-ooh
---------------------------------------------------
The birds have left their trees
The light pours onto me
I can feel you lying there all on your own
We got here the hard way
All those words that we exchange
Is it any wonder things get broke?

Cause in my heart and in my head
I'll never take back the things I said
So high above, I feel it coming down
She said, in my heart and in my head
Tell me why this has to end
Oh, no, oh, no

I can't save us, my Atlantis, we fall
We built this town on shaky ground
I can't save us, my Atlantis, oh, no
We built it up to pull it down

Now all the birds have fled
The hurt just leaves me scared
Losing everything I've ever known
It's all become too much
Maybe I'm not built for love
If I knew that I could reach you, I would go

It's in my heart and in my head
You can't take back the things you said
So high above, I feel it coming down
She said, in my heart and in my head
Tell me why this has to end
Oh, no, oh, no

I can't save us, my Atlantis, we fall
We built this town on shaky ground
I can't save us, my Atlantis, oh, no
We built it up to pull it down

And we build it up and we build it up
And we build it up to pull it down
And we build it up and we build it up
And we build it up to pull it down

I can't save us, my Atlantis, we fall
We built this town on shaky ground
I can't save us, my Atlantis, oh, no
We built it up to pull it down
---------------------------------------------------
Lay where you're laying
Don't make a sound
I know they're watching
They're watching

All the commotion
The kiddie-like play
It has people talking
Talking

You
Your sex is on fire

The dark of the alley
The breaking of day
Head while I'm driving
I'm driving

Soft lips are open
Them knuckles are pale
Feels like you're dying
You're dying

You
Your sex is on fire
Consumed
With what's just transpired

Hot as a fever
Rattle of bones
I could just taste it
Taste it

If this not forever
If this just tonight
Oh we're still the greatest
The greatest
The greatest

You
Your sex is on fire

You
Your sex is on fire
Consumed
With what's just transpired

And you
Your sex is on fire
Consumed
With what's just transpired

Girl, I can buy your ass the world with my paystub
Ooh that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods

Piss out your per diem you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM I still ride Mercedes, funk

I knew my rent was gon' be late about a week ago (Hey)
I worked my ass off, but I still can't pay it though (Woo)
But I got just enough to get off in this club
Have me a good time, before my time is up
Hey, let's get it now

Ooh, I want the time of my life, yeah (Mr. Worldwide), oh, baby
Ooh, give me the time of my life (Ne-yo), hey, hey, hey

This the last twenty dollars I got
But I'ma have a good time balling tonight
Tell the bartender, "Line up some shots"
'Cause I'ma get loose tonight
She's on fire, she's so hot
I'm no liar, she burned up the spot
Look like Mariah, I took another shot
And told her drop, drop, drop, drop it like it's hot

Dirty talk (Hey), dirty dance (Hey)
She a freaky girl (Hey) and I'm a freaky man (Hey)
She on the rebound, broke up with her ex
And I'm like Rodman, ready on deck

I told her, "Wanna ride out?" And she said, "Yes"
We didn't go to church but I got blessed


I knew my rent was gon' be late about a week ago

Better get yours 'cause I'm gon' get mine
Party every night like my last
Mami know the drill, shake that ass
Go ahead, baby, let me see what you got
You know you got the biggest booty in this spot
And I just wanna see that thing drop
From the back, to the front, to the top

You know me, I'm off in the cut
Always like a squirrel looking for a nut
This is a for sure, I'm not talking 'bout luck
I'm not talking 'bout love, I'm talking 'bout lust
Now let's get loose, have some fun
Forget about bills and the first of the month
It's my night, your night, our night, let's turn it up


I knew my rent was gon' be late about a week ago
I worked my ass off, but I still can't pay it though
But I got just enough to get off in this club

'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
I'm gonna give you my heart
'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
'Cause you light up the path

I don't care, go on and tear me apart
I don't care if you do, ooh
'Cause in a sky, 'cause in a sky full of stars
I think I saw you

'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
I wanna die in your arms
'Cause you get lighter the more it gets dark
I'm gonna give you my heart

I don't care, go on and tear me apart
I don't care if you do, ooh
'Cause in a sky, 'cause in a sky full of stars
I think I see you
I think I see you

'Cause you're a sky, you're a sky full of stars
Such a heavenly view
You're such a heavenly view
---------------------------------------------------
I walked across an empty land
I knew the pathway like the back of my hand
I felt the earth beneath my feet
Sat by the river and it made me complete

Oh simple thing, where have you gone?
I'm getting tired and I need someone to rely on

I came across a fallen tree
I felt the branches of it looking at me
Is this the place we used to love?
Is this the place that I've been dreaming of?

Oh simple thing, where have you gone?
I'm getting old and I need something to rely on

And if you have a minute why don't we go
Talk about it somewhere only we know?
This could be the end of everything
So why don't we go
Somewhere only we know?
Somewhere only we know?

Oh simple thing, where have you gone?
I'm getting old and I need someone to rely on
So tell me when you're gonna let me in
I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin

And if you have a minute why don't we go
Talk about it somewhere only we know?
'Cause this could be the end of everything
So why don't we go?
Somewhere only we know?
Somewhere only we know?
---------------------------------------------------
Hey, where did we go
Days when the rains came?
Down in the hollow
Playing a new game

Laughing and a-running, hey, hey
Skipping and a-jumping
In the misty morning fog with
Our, our hearts a-thumping
And you, my brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

Whatever happened
To Tuesday and so slow
Going down the old mine with a
Transistor radio

Standing in the sunlight laughing
Hide behind a rainbow's wall
Slipping and a-sliding
All along the waterfall
With you, my brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

Do you remember when we used to sing
Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah
Just like that
Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah
La dee dah

So hard to find my way
Now that I'm all on my own
I saw you just the other day
My, how you have grown!

Cast my memory back there, Lord
Sometime I'm overcome thinking about
Making love in the green grass
Behind the stadium
With you, my brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

Do you remember when we used to sing
Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah
Laying in the green grass
Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah
Dee dah dee dah dee dah dee dah dee dah dee
Sha la la la la la la la la la la la la
Dee dah la dee dah la dee dah la
D-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d
---------------------------------------------------
You could never know what it's like
Your blood like winter freezes just like ice
And there's a cold lonely light that shines from you
You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use

And did you think this fool could never win?
Well, look at me, I'm a-coming back again
I got a taste of love in a simple way
And if you need to know while I'm still standing you just fade away

Don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did?
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
And I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

I'm still standing. Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm still standing. Yeah, yeah, yeah

Once I never could've hoped to win
You're starting down the road leaving me again
The threats you made were meant to cut me down
And if our love was just a circus you'd be a clown by now

You know I'm still standing better than I ever did
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

I'm still standing. Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm still standing. Yeah, yeah, yeah

Don't you know that I'm still standing better than I ever did?
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
And I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

I'm still standing. Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm still standing. Yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm still standing. Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm still standing. Yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm still standing. Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm still standing. Yeah, yeah, yeah
---------------------------------------------------
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh, girl for goodness' sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own. Well, I ain't

And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care. I don't
But you still hit my phone up
And, baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job
Didn't see what's going on
But now I know
I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care. I don't
But you still hit my phone up
And, baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job
Didn't see what's going on
But now I know
I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love. Now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think (you think) that I'm (that I'm) still holdin' on (holdin' on) to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say
"Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you"

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never have

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside
Frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never have

Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa (I bless the rains)
I bless the rains down in Africa (I bless the rains)
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never have
---------------------------------------------------
Never made it as a wise man
I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealing
Tired of livin' like a blind man
I'm sick of sight without a sense of feeling
And this is how you remind me

This is how you remind me of what I really am
This is how you remind me of what I really am

It's not like you to say sorry
I was waitin' on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breakin'
And I've been wrong, I've been down
Been to the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream, "Are we havin' fun yet?"

Yet, yet, yet, no, no
Yet, yet, yet, no, no

It's not like you didn't know that
I said, "I love you," and I swear I still do
And it must have been so bad
'Cause livin' with me must have damn near killed you

And this is how you remind me of what I really am
This is how you remind me of what I really am

It's not like you to say sorry
I was waitin' on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breakin'
And I've been wrong, I've been down
Been to the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream, "Are we havin' fun yet?"

Yet, yet, yet, no, no
Yet, yet, yet, no, no
Yet, yet, yet, no, no
Yet, yet, yet, no, no

Never made it as a wise man
I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealin'
And this is how you remind me
This is how you remind me

This is how you remind me of what I really am
This is how you remind me of what I really am

It's not like you to say sorry
I was waitin' on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breakin'
And I've been wrong, I've been down
Been to the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream, "Are we havin' fun yet?"

Yet, yet, are we havin' fun yet?
Yet, yet, are we havin' fun yet?
Yeah, yeah (These five words in my head scream)
Are we havin' fun yet?
Yeah, yeah (These five words in my head)
No, no

I was scared of dentists and the dark
I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
Oh, all my friends are turning green
You're the magician's assistant in their dream

Ah-ooh, ah-ooh, they come unstuck

Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left-hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat 'cause
You're gonna sing the words wrong

There's this movie that I think you'll like
This guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City
This cowboy's running from himself
And she's been living on the highest shelf

Ah-ooh, ah-ooh, they come unstuck

Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left-hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat 'cause
You're gonna sing the words wrong

I was scared of dentists and the dark
I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
Oh, all my friends are turning green
You're the magician's assistant in their dream
---------------------------------------------------
Oh, father tell me, do we get what we deserve?
Oh, we get what we deserve

And way down we go
Oh, way down we go
Say, way down we go
Way down we go

Whoa, you let your feet run wild
Time has come as we all go down
Yeah but for the fall—oh, my—
Do you dare to look them right in the eyes?

'Cause they will run you down, down 'til the dark
Yes, and they will run you down, down 'til you fall
And they will run you down, down to your core
Yeah, 'til you can't crawl no more

And way down we go
Way down we go
Say, way down we go

'Cause they will run you down, down 'til you're caught
Way down we go

Whoa, baby, yeah
Whoa, baby
Baby
Way down we go
Yeah

And way down we go
Way down we go
Say, way down we go
Way down we go

City's breaking down on a camel's back
They just have to go 'cause they don't know wack
So while you fill the streets, it's appealing to see
You won't get out the county 'cause you're damned and free

You got a new horizon. It's ephemeral style
A melancholy town where we never smile
And all I wanna hear is the message beep
My dreams, they've gotta kiss me
'Cause I don't get to sleep, no

Windmill, windmill for the land
Turn forever hand in hand
Take it all in on your stride
It is ticking, falling down

Love forever. Love is free
Let's turn forever, you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?

Laughing gas these hazmats, fast cats
Lining 'em up like ass cracks
Play these ponies at the track
It's my chocolate attack

Shit, I'm steppin' in the heart of this here (Yeah)
Care Bear reppin' it harder this year (Yeah)
Watch me as I gravitate
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

Yo, we gon' ghost town
This Motown
With your sound
You're in the blink
Gon' bite the dust
Can't fight with us
With your sound
You kill the Inc

So don't stop, get it, get it, get it
Until you're cheddar headed
And watch the way I navigate
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

Sha, sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da-ca; feel good

Oh oh oh oh

Oh, her eyes, her eyes
Make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair
Falls perfectly without her trying
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day
Yeah

I know, I know
When I compliment her she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so
Sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, "Do I look okay?"
I say

When I see your face (face, face...)
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing (amazing)
Just the way you are (are)
And when you smile (smile, smile...)
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing (amazing)
Just the way you are (are)
Yeah

Her lips, her lips
I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh, her laugh
She hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day

Oh you know, you know, you know
I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for
Then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay
You know I'll say,

When I see your face (face, face...)
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing (amazing)
Just the way you are (are)
And when you smile (smile, smile...)
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing (amazing)
Just the way you are (are)

The way you are
The way you are
Girl, you're amazing (amazing)
Just the way you are (are)

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing (amazing)
Just the way you are (are)
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are

Yeah

You must think that I'm stupid
You must think that I'm a fool
You must think that I'm new to this
But I have seen this all before

I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true

I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)

I know you're thinking I'm heartless
I know you're thinking I'm cold
I'm just protecting my innocence
I'm just protecting my soul

I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true

I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
No way that you'll see me cry
(No way that you'll see me cry)

I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
No
No, no, no, no, no
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
No, no, no, no
No, no, no
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
(No way that you'll see me cry)
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)

'Cause every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true
I'm way too good at goodbyes
---------------------------------------------------
I've been holding my breath
I've been counting to ten
Over something you said
I've been holding back tears
While you're throwing back beers
I'm alone in bed

You know I, I'm afraid of change
Guess that's why we stay the same

So tell me to leave
I'll pack my bags, get on the road
Find someone that loves you
Better than I do, darling I know
'Cause you remind me every day
I'm not enough but I still stay

Feels like a lifetime
Just tryna get by
While we're dying inside
I've done a lot of things wrong
Loving you being one
But I can't move on

You know I, I'm afraid of change
Guess that's why we stay the same

So tell me to leave
I'll pack my bags, get on the road
Find someone that loves you
Better than I do, darling I know
'Cause you remind me every day
I'm not enough but I still stay

If you want me to leave
Then tell me to leave, and baby I'll go

You remind me every day
I'm not enough but I still stay
---------------------------------------------------
Well good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world

And good for you, I guess that you've been working on yourself
I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better man for your brand-new girl

Well good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doing great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that

I've lost my mind
I've spent the night
Crying on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

Well good for you, I guess you're getting everything you want
You bought a new car and your career's really taking off
It's like we never even happened, baby
What the fuck is up with that?

And good for you, it's like you never even met me
Remember when you swore to God, I was the only
Person who ever got you
Well, screw that and screw you
You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do

Well good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doing great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that

I've lost my mind
I've spent the night
Crying on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

Maybe I'm too emotional
But your apathy's like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all
Maybe I'm too emotional
Your apathy's like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all

Well good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doing great out there without me, baby
Like a damn sociopath

I've lost my mind
I've spent the night
Crying on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

Well good for you, I guess you moved on really easily

Uptown girl
She's been living in her uptown world
I bet she's never had a backstreet guy
I bet her mamma never told her why
I'm gonna try for an

Uptown girl
She's been living in her white-bread world
As long as anyone with hot blood can
And now, she's looking for a downtown man
That's what I am

And when she knows what she wants from her time
And when she wakes up and makes up her mind

She'll see I'm not so tough
Just because I'm in love with an

Uptown girl
You know I've seen her in her uptown world
She's getting tired of her high-class toys
And all the presents from her uptown boys
She's got a choice

Uptown girl
You know I can't afford to buy her pearls
But maybe, someday, when my ship comes in
She'll understand what kind of guy I've been
And then I'll win

And when she's walking, she's looking so fine
And when she's talking, she'll say that she's mine

She'll say I'm not so tough
Just because I'm in love with an

Uptown girl
She's been living in her white-bread world
As long as anyone with hot blood can
And now, she's looking for a downtown man
That's what I am

Uptown girl, she's my uptown girl
You know I'm in love with an uptown girl, my uptown girl
You know I'm in love with an uptown girl, my uptown girl
You know I'm in love with an uptown girl, my uptown girl
---------------------------------------------------
Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain
I leave my heart open but it stays right here empty for days
She told me in the morning she don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die these words will be written on my stone

And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The ground beneath my feet is open wide
The way that I been holding on too tight
With nothing in between

The story of my life
I take her home
I drive all night
To keep her warm
And time is frozen (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life
I give her hope
I spend her love
Until she's broke
Inside
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)

Written on these walls are the colors that I can't change
Leave my heart open but it stays right here in its cage
I know that in the morning now I'll see us in the light upon a hill
Although I am broken, my heart is untamed, still

And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The fire beneath my feet is burning bright
The way that I've been holding on so tight
With nothing in between

The story of my life
I take her home
I drive all night
To keep her warm
And time is frozen (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life
I give her hope
I spend her love
Until she's broke
Inside
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)

And I been waiting for this time to come around
But baby running after you is like chasing the clouds

The story of my life
I take her home
I drive all night
To keep her warm
And time is frozen
The story of my life
I give her hope (give her hope)
I spend her love
Until she's broke (until she's broke inside)
Inside
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)

The story of my life
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life

I see your red door, I want it painted black
No colors anymore, I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
With flowers and my love both never to come back
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
Like a newborn baby, it just happens everyday
I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see my red door, I must have it painted black
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black
No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee this thing happening to you
If I look hard enough into the setting sun
My love will laugh with me before the morning comes

(I want to see it painted, painted, painted black
Black as night, black as coal
I want to see the sun, blotted out from the sky)

I see your red door, I want it painted black
(I want to see it painted, painted, painted black
Black as night, black as coal)
No colors any more, I want them to turn black
(I want to see the sun, blotted out from the sky, the sky, the sky)
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
(I want to see it painted, painted, painted black
Black as night, black as coal)
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes
(I want to see the sun, blotted out from the sky)

Mm-mm-mm-mm

I've seen the world, done it all
Had my cake now
Diamonds, brilliant, and Bel Air now
Hot summer nights, mid-July
When you and I were forever wild
The crazy days, city lights
The way you'd play with me like a child

Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?

I've seen the world, lit it up as my stage now
Channeling angels in the new age now
Hot summer days, rock and roll
The way you'd play for me at your show
And all the ways I got to know
Your pretty face and electric soul

Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?

Dear Lord, when I get to heaven
Please, let me bring my man
When he comes, tell me that You'll let him in
Father, tell me if You can
All that grace, all that body
All that face makes me wanna party
He's my sun, he makes me shine like diamonds

Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?

Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?
Will you still love me when I'm not young and beautiful?

Pa-la-la-la, la-la-la, la
Da-dam

Je te laisserai des mots
En'sous de ta porte
En'sous de les murs qui chantent
Tout pres de la place ou tes pieds se passent
Cache dans les trous de ton divan
Et quand tu est seul pendant un instant

Ramasse moi
Quand tu voudras
Ramasse moi
Quand tu voudras
Ramasse moi
Quand tu voudras

Tell me somethin', girl
Are you happy in this modern world?
Or do you need more?
Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?

I'm falling
In all the good times I find myself longin' for change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself


Tell me something, boy
Aren't you tired tryna fill that void?
Or do you need more?
Ain't it hard keeping it so hardcore?

I'm falling
In all the good times I find myself longin' for change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself

I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now


In the sha-ha-sha-ha-low
In the sha-ha-sha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-ha-sha-ha-ha-low
We're far from the shallow now


Oh, ha, ah, ha
Oh-ah, ha
Oh, ha, ah, ha

I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now


In the sha-ha-sha-ha-low
In the sha-ha-sha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-ha-sha-ha-ha-low
We're far from the shallow now
---------------------------------------------------
Just stop your crying
It's a sign of the times
Welcome to the final show
Hope you're wearing your best clothes

You can't bribe the door on your way to the sky
You look pretty good down here
But you ain't really good

We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets, the bullets?
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
Your bullets, the bullets?

Just stop your crying
It's a sign of the times
We gotta get away from here
We gotta get away from here
Just stop your crying
It'll be alright
They told me that the end is near
We gotta get away from here

Just stop your crying
Have the time of your life
Breaking through the atmosphere
And things are pretty good from here

Remember, everything will be alright
We can meet again somewhere
Somewhere far away from here

We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets, the bullets?
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets, the bullets?

Just stop your crying
It's a sign of the times
We gotta get away from here
We gotta get away from here
Stop your crying
Baby, it'll be alright
They told me that the end is near
We gotta get away from here

We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets, the bullets?
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
Your bullets, the bullets?

We don't talk enough
We should open up
Before it's all too much
Will we ever learn?
We've been here before
It's just what we know

Stop your crying, baby
It's a sign of the times
We gotta get away
We got to get away
We got to get away
We got to get away
We got to get away
We got to—we got to—away
We got to—we got to—away
We got to—we got to—away

Psychic spies from China try to steal your mind's elation
And little girls from Sweden dream of silver-screen quotation
And if you want these kind of dreams, it's Californication

It's the edge of the world and all of Western civilization
The sun may rise in the East, at least it settled in a final location
It's understood that Hollywood sells Californication

Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
Celebrity skin: is this your chin or is that war you're waging?

First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn

Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

Marry me, girl, be my fairy to the world, be my very own constellation
A teenage bride with a baby inside getting high on information
And buy me a star on the boulevard, it's Californication

Space may be the final frontier but it's made in a Hollywood basement
And Cobain, can you hear the spheres singing songs off Station to Station?
And Alderaan's not far away, it's Californication

Born and raised by those who praise control of population
Well, everybody's been there, and I don't mean no vacation

First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn

Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

Destruction leads to a very rough road but it also breeds creation
And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar, they're just another good vibration
And tidal waves couldn't save the world from Californication

Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
Sicker than the rest, there is no test, but this is what you're craving

First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn

Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

Enviyon on the mix
No, no, no, no
No-no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you so I must replace you (oh)
Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listening to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but
I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you so I must replace you (oh)
Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listening to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but
I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head

I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past
But I want it to last
You were made outta plastic (fake)
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heart break

You made my heart break
You made my heart ache
(I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache
(Can't take back the love that I gave you)
You made my heart break
(Were made outta plastic fake)
You made my heart ache
(I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break again
(I was tangled up your drastic ways)
(Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?)

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you so I must replace you (oh)
Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listening to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but
I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you so I must replace you (oh)
Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listening to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but
I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

Leave this shit in the past but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic (fake)
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?

When we were young the future was so bright (Whoa)
The old neighborhood was so alive (Whoa)
And every kid on the whole damn street (Whoa)
Was gonna make it big and not be beat
Now the neighborhood's cracked and torn (Whoa)
The kids are grown up but their lives are worn (Whoa)
How can one little street
Swallow so many lives?

Chances thrown, nothing's free
Longing for what used to be
Still it's hard, hard to see
Fragile lives, shattered dreams
(Go!)

Jamie had a chance, well she really did (Whoa)
Instead she dropped out and had a couple of kids (Whoa)
Mark still lives at home 'cause he's got no job (Whoa)
He just plays guitar and smokes a lot of pot
Jay committed suicide (Whoa)
Brandon OD'd and died (Whoa)
What the hell is going on?
The cruelest dream, reality

Chances thrown, nothing's free
Longing for what used to be
Still it's hard, hard to see
Fragile lives, shattered dreams
(Go!)

Chances thrown, nothing's free
Longing for what used to be
Still it's hard, hard to see
Fragile lives, shattered dreams
---------------------------------------------------
Saturday morning jumped out of bed
And put on my best suit
Got in my car and raced like a jet
All the way to you
Knocked on your door with heart in my hand
To ask you a question
'Cause I know that you're an old-fashioned man, yeah

Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?
Say yes, say yes 'cause I need to know
You say I'll never get your blessing 'til the day I die
Tough luck, my friend, but the answer is 'No'

Why you gotta be so rude?
Don't you know I'm human too?
Why you gotta be so rude?
I'm gonna marry her anyway

Marry that girl
Marry her anyway
Marry that girl
Yeah, no matter what you say
Marry that girl
And we'll be a family
Why you gotta be so
Rude

I hate to do this, you leave no choice
Can't live without her
Love me or hate me we will be both
Standing at that altar
Or we will run away
To another galaxy, you know
You know she's in love with me
She will go anywhere I go

Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?
Say yes, say yes 'cause I need to know
You say I'll never get your blessing 'til the day I die
Tough luck, my friend, 'cause the answer's still 'No"

Why you gotta be so rude?
Don't you know I'm human too?
Why you gotta be so rude?
I'm gonna marry her anyway

Marry that girl
Marry her anyway
Marry that girl
No matter what you say
Marry that girl
And we'll be a family
Why you gotta be so
Rude
Rude

Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?
Say yes, say yes 'cause I need to know
You say, I'll never get your blessing 'til the day I die
Tough luck, my friend, but 'No' still means 'No'!

Why you gotta be so rude?
Don't you know I'm human too?
Why you gotta be so rude?
I'm gonna marry her anyway

Marry that girl
Marry her anyway
Marry that girl
No matter what you say
Marry that girl
And we'll be a family
Why you gotta be so
Rude
Why you gotta be so
Rude
Why you gotta be so rude?

Und ich zeig' dir, wie man lebt, Baby, uh-uh
Lass dich auf mich ein und ich lass' dich nicht allein
Und ich zeig' dir, wie es geht, Baby, uh-uh
Und ich pack' was von mein' Stein auf mein Handy, mach' ihn klein
Dis ist alles kein Problem, Baby, uh-uh
Heute Nacht gibt's nur uns zwei, ich vergess' mit dir die Zeit
Dis ist alles kein Problem, Baby, uh-uh
Dis ist alles kein Problem, Baby, no, no

Alles kein Problem, ich zeig' dir, wie man lebt
Uber dreißig Grad, trotzdem fallt bei uns der Schnee
Mach es dir bequem, an mei'm Tisch muss keiner steh'n
Alles, was hier steht, Baby, darfst du dir auch nehm'n
Baby, das sind Nachte hier in 104
Warum willst du geh'n? Bitte bleib noch hier
Ganze Viertel ist am feiern, komm ich zeig' es dir
Bei uns kannst du das Gefuhl fur die Zeit verlier'n

Fuck Love, doch sie macht es gut
Sie fragt mich: "Ey, hast du noch was zu zieh'n in dei'm Schuh?"
Sie fuhlt sich so geborgen, sonst hort niemand ihr zu
Kann nix dagegen tun, wenn sie wieder ma' ruft

Und ich zeig' dir, wie man lebt, Baby, uh-uh
Lass dich auf mich ein und ich lass' dich nicht allein
Und ich zeig' dir, wie es geht, Baby, uh-uh
Und ich pack' was von mein' Stein auf mein Handy, mach' ihn klein
Dis ist alles kein Problem, Baby, uh-uh
Heute Nacht gibt's nur uns zwei, ich vergess' mit dir die Zeit
Dis ist alles kein Problem, Baby, uh-uh
Dis ist alles kein Problem, Baby, no, no

Hole weißes Zeug aus meiner Tasche raus
Streu' es auf ihr Handy wie der Sandmann rauf
Ab jetze ist mir klar, wir geh'n zusamm'n nach Haus
Und ich mach' ihr ein Geschenk, so wie Santa Claus
Ich will sie die ganze Nacht, Dicka, ja, ich nehm' sie mit
Sie hat zwar Doppel-D, aber trinkt 'ne Skinny Bitch
An mei'm Hals, das ist kein Blut, nein, das ist ihr Lippenstift
Sie ist einfach unglaublich, Mann, sie macht mich so verruckt

Fuck Love, doch sie macht es gut
Sie fragt mich: "Ey, hast du noch was zu zieh'n in dei'm Schuh?"
Sie fuhlt sich so geborgen, sonst hort niemand ihr zu
Kann nix dagegen tun, wenn sie wieder ma' ruft

Was ich will, das bist nur du
Sonst geht es mir nicht gut
Du
Sonst geht es mir nicht gut

Und ich zeig' dir, wie man lebt, Baby, uh-uh
Lass dich auf mich ein und ich lass' dich nicht allein
Und ich zeig' dir, wie es geht, Baby, uh-uh
Und ich pack' was von mein' Stein auf mein Handy, mach' ihn klein
Dis ist alles kein Problem, Baby, uh-uh
Heute Nacht gibt's nur uns zwei, ich vergess' mit dir die Zeit
Dis ist alles kein Problem, Baby, uh-uh
Dis ist alles kein Problem, Baby, no, no

How can you see into my eyes like open doors?
Leading you down into my core where I've become so numb
Without a soul my spirit's sleeping somewhere cold
Until you find it there and lead it back home

(Wake me up)
Wake me up inside
(I can't wake up)
Wake me up inside
(Save me)
Call my name and save me from the dark
(Wake me up)
Bid my blood to run
(I can't wake up)
Before I come undone
(Save me)
Save me from the nothing I've become

Now that I know what I'm without
You can't just leave me
Breathe into me and make me real
Bring me to life

(Wake me up)
Wake me up inside
(I can't wake up)
Wake me up inside
(Save me)
Call my name and save me from the dark
(Wake me up)
Bid my blood to run
(I can't wake up)
Before I come undone
(Save me)
Save me from the nothing I've become

Bring me to life
(I've been living a lie, there's nothing inside)
Bring me to life

Frozen inside without your touch
Without your love, darling
Only you are the life among the dead

All this time I can't believe I couldn't see
Kept in the dark but you were there in front of me
I've been sleeping a thousand years it seems
Got to open my eyes to everything
Without a thought, without a voice, without a soul
Don't let me die here
There must be something more
Bring me to life

(Wake me up)
Wake me up inside
(I can't wake up)
Wake me up inside
(Save me)
Call my name and save me from the dark
(Wake me up)
Bid my blood to run
(I can't wake up)
Before I come undone
(Save me)
Save me from the nothing I've become

Bring me to life
(I've been living a lie, there's nothing inside)
Bring me to life

I come home in the morning light
My mother says, "When you gonna live your life right?"
Oh, mamma, dear, we're not the fortunate ones
And girls—they wanna have fun
Oh, girls just wanna have fun

The phone rings in the middle of the night
My father yells, "What you gonna do with your life?"
Oh, daddy, dear, you know you're still number one
But girls—they wanna have fun
Oh, girls just wanna have

That's all they really want
Some fun
When the working day is done
Oh, girls—they wanna have fun
Oh, girls just wanna have fun

Girls—they wanna
Wanna have fun

Some boys take a beautiful girl
And hide her away from the rest of the world
I wanna be the one to walk in the sun
Oh, girls—they wanna have fun
Oh, girls just wanna have

That's all they really want
Some fun
When the working day is done
Oh, girls—they wanna have fun
Oh, girls just wanna have fun

Girls—they wanna
Wanna have fun
Girls wanna have

They just wanna, they just wanna
(Girls)
They just wanna, they just wanna

I would be complex, I would be cool
They'd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to
And that would be okay for me to do
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you

I'd be a fearless leader
I'd be an alpha type
When everyone believes ya
What's that like?

I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man

They'd say I hustled, put in the work
They wouldn't shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve
What I was wearing, if I was rude
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves

And they would toast to me, oh, let the players play
I'd be just like Leo in Saint-Tropez

I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man

What's it like to brag about raking in dollars
And getting bitches and models?
And it's all good if you're bad
And it's okay if you're mad
If I was out flashing my dollars
I'd be a bitch, not a baller
They'd paint me out to be bad
So, it's okay that I'm mad

I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (You know that)
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again (Coming at me again)
'Cause if I was a man (If I was a man)
Then I'd be the man (Then I'd be the man)
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can (As fast as I can)
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (Hey)
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again (Coming at me again)
'Cause if I was a man (If I was a man), then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man (Oh)
I'd be the man (Yeah)
I'd be the man (I'd be the man)

If I was a man, then I'd be the man
---------------------------------------------------
I kinda wanna throw my phone across the room
'Cause all I see are girls too good to be true
With paper-white teeth and perfect bodies
Wish I didn't care

I know their beauty's not my lack
But it feels like that weight is on my back
And I can't let it go

Com-comparison is killin' me slowly
I think I think too much
'Bout kids who don't know me
I'm so sick of myself
I'd rather be, rather be
Anyone, anyone else
My jealousy, jealousy started followin' me (He-he-he, he)
Started followin' me (He-he-he, he)

And I see everyone gettin' all the things I want
I'm happy for them, but then again, I'm not
Just cool vintage clothes and vacation photos
I can't stand it
Oh God, I sound crazy

Their win is not my loss
I know it's true, but
I can't help gettin' caught up in it all

Com-comparison is killin' me slowly
I think I think too much
'Bout kids who don't know me
I'm so sick of myself
Rather be, rather be
Anyone, anyone else
My jealousy, jealousy (Yeah)

All your friends are so cool, you go out every night
In your daddy's nice car, yeah, you're livin' the life
Got a pretty face, a pretty boyfriend, too
I wanna be you so bad and I don't even know you
All I see is what I should be
Happier, prettier, jealousy, jealousy
All I see is what I should be
I'm losin' it, all I get's jealousy, jealousy

Com-comparison is killin' me slowly
I think I think too much
'Bout kids who don't know me
And I'm so sick of myself
Rather be, rather be (Oh, oh)
Anyone, anyone else (Anybody else)
Jealousy, jealousy
Oh, I'm so sick of myself
I'd rather be, rather be (Oh-oh-oh)
Anyone, anyone else
Jealousy, jealousy started followin' me
---------------------------------------------------
One, two, three, uh!

My baby don't mess around
Because she loves me so, and this I know for sure (Uh)
But does she really wanna
But can't stand to see me walk out the door? (Ah)
Don't try to fight the feeling
'Cause the thought alone is killing me right now (Uh)
Thank God for Mom and Dad
For sticking two together 'cause we don't know how (C'mon)

Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!

You think you've got it, oh, you think you've got it
But "got it" just don't get it 'til there's nothing at all (Ah!)
We get together, oh, we get together
But separate's always better when there's feelings involved (Ah)
If what they say is, "Nothing is forever"
Then what makes, then what makes, then what makes
Then what makes, what makes, what makes love the exception?
So why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh
Are we so in denial when we know we're not happy here?
Y'all don't wanna hear me, you just wanna dance

Hey ya! (Uh-oh) Hey ya! (Uh-oh)
Don't want to meet your daddy
Hey ya! (Uh-oh)
Just want you in my Caddy (Uh-oh)
Hey ya! (Uh-oh)
Don't want to meet your mama (Uh-oh)
Hey ya! (Uh-oh)
Just want to make you cum-a' (Uh-oh)
Hey ya! (Uh-oh)
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm just being honest (Uh-oh)
Hey ya!
I'm just being honest

Hey, all right now, all right now, fellas (Yeah?)
Now, what's cooler than being cool? (Ice Cold!)
I can't hear ya
I say what's, what's cooler than being cool? (Ice Cold!)
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right
Okay now, ladies (Yeah?)
Now, we gon' break this thing down in just a few seconds
Now, don't have me break this thing down for nothing
Now, I want to see y'all on your baddest behavior
Lend me some sugar, I am your neighbor
Ah, here we go!

Shake it, sh-shake it, shake it, sh-shake it (Uh-oh)
Shake it, sh-shake it, shake it, shake it, sh-shake it (Uh-oh)
Shake it like a Polaroid picture, hey ya!
Shake it, sh-shake it, shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, shake it (Okay), shake it, sugar
Shake it like a Polaroid picture

Now, all the Beyonces and Lucy Lius
And baby dolls, get on the floor
You know what to do, oh, you know what to do
You know what to do

Hey ya! (Uh-oh) Hey ya! (Uh-oh)
Hey ya! (Uh-oh) Hey ya! (Uh-oh, hey ya!)
Hey ya! (Uh-oh) Hey ya! (Oh, oh, uh-oh)
Hey ya! (Uh-oh) Hey ya! (Uh-oh)
Hey ya! Hey ya!

A scrub is a guy that thinks he's fly
And is also known as a buster
Always talkin' about what he wants
And just sits on his broke ass
So, no

I don't want your number, no.
I don't want to give you mine and, no,
I don't want to meet you nowhere, no.
I don't want none of your time and, no,


I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me
I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me

But a scrub is checkin' me
But his game is kinda weak
And I know that he cannot approach me
'Cause I'm lookin' like class and he's lookin' like trash
Can't get with a dead-beat ass
So, no

I don't want your number, no.
I don't want to give you mine and, no,
I don't want to meet you nowhere, no.
I don't want none of your time, no.



If you don't have a car and you're walking
Oh yes, son, I'm talking to you
If you live at home with your mamma
Oh yes, son, I'm talking to you, baby
If you have a shorty but you don't show love
Oh yes, son, I'm talking to you
Wanna get with me with no money
Oh no, I don't want, no, oh

No scrub
No scrub, no, no
No scrub, no, no, no, no, no
No scrub, no, no
No


See, if you can't spatially expand my horizons
Then that leaves you in a class with scrubs, never rising
I don't find it surprising if you don't have the Gs
To please me and bounce from here to the coast of overseas
So, let me give you something to think about
Inundate your mind with intentions to turn you out
Can't forget the focus on the picture in front of me
You as clear as DVD on digital TV screens
Satisfy my appetite with something spectacular
Check your vernacular, and then I get back to ya
With diamond-like precision
Insatiable is what I envision
Can't detect acquisition
From your friend's expedition
Mr. Big Willy, if you really wanna know
Ask Chilli, could I be a silly ho?
Not really
T-Boz and all my senoritas
Are steppin' on your FILAs
But you don't hear me, though
---------------------------------------------------
Go to bed now I can tell
Pain is on the way out now
Look away and domino falls away

I know it's hard looking in
Knowing that tomorrow you'll be back again
Pin your head and let me in
I'm waiting
So long

I was staring into the light
When I saw you in the distance, I knew that you'd be mine
Am I moving back in time
Just standing still

I met a man with a broken back
He had a fear in his eyes that I could understand
I can even shake the hand
When I break it in

I've been pulling on a wire, but it just won't break
I've been turning up the dial, but I hear no sound
I resist what I cannot change
But I wanna find what can't be found

I'm aware you're tired and lost
Like a demon in the doorway, waiting to be born
But I'm here all alone, just begging

Pull me close and let me hold you in
Give me the deeper understanding of who I am
Yeah, I'm moving back again
I'm waiting here

I'm just pulling on a wire, but it just won't break
I've been turning up the dial, but I hear no sound
I resist what I cannot change, own it in your own way
Yeah, I wanna find what can't be found
---------------------------------------------------
(Oh)
(You're my cold heart)
(Oh)


It's a human sign
When things go wrong
When the scent of her lingers
And temptation's strong

Cold, cold heart
Hard done by you (Oh)
Some things lookin' better, baby
Just passin' through (No, no, no, no, no)


And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no
And this is what I should have said
Well, I thought it, but I kept it hid


Cold, cold heart
Hard done by you (Oh)
Some things lookin' better, baby
Just passin' through (No, no, no, no, no)


And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no (No, no, no, no, no)
And this is what I should have said
Well, I thought it, but I kept it hid


Cold, cold heart (Oh)
Hard done by you
Some things lookin' better, baby (Oh)
Just passin' through (No, no, no, no, no)


And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no (No, no, no, no, no)
And this is what I should have said (And I think it's gonna be a long, long time)
('Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find)
Well, I thought it, but I kept it hid (I'm not the man they think I am at home)
(Oh, no, no, no)
(No, no, no, no, no)

Shoorah (Oh)
Shoorah
Shoorah (Oh)
Shoorah
(No, no, no, no, no)
---------------------------------------------------
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer even now

Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost Upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone
And that magic's not here no more
And I might be okay
But I'm not fine at all

'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on a tee-ball team
You tell me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me

And I know it's long gone
And there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well, yeah

Maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well

And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all... too well

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone

But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it 'cause you remember it all too well, yeah

'Cause there we are again, when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well

Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well
---------------------------------------------------
I took an arrow to the heart
I never kissed a mouth that tastes like yours
Strawberries and then something more
Ooh yeah, I want it all

Lipstick on my guitar
Fill up the engine, we can drive real far
Go dancing underneath the stars
Ooh yeah, I want it all

Mmm, you got me feeling like

I wanna be that guy
I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile
I wanna feel like I
Like my soul's on fire
I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah, you got me singing like

Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up
Give me the shivers
Oh baby, you wanna dance till the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over then we'll bring it right back

And we'll say
Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up
Give me the shivers
Oh baby, you wanna dance till the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over then we'll bring it right back

Into the car
On the backseat in the moonlit dark
Wrap me up between your legs and arms
Ooh, I can't get enough

You know you could tear me apart
Put me back together and take my heart
I never thought that I could love this hard
Ooh, I can't get enough

Mmm, you got me feeling like

I wanna be that guy
I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile
I wanna feel like I
Like my soul's on fire
I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah, you got me singing like

Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up
Give me the shivers
Oh baby, you wanna dance till the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over then we'll bring it right back

And we'll say
Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up
Give me the shivers
Oh baby, you wanna dance till the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over then we'll bring it right back

Baby, you burn so hot
You make me shiver with the fire you got
This thing we started, I don't want it to stop
You know you make me shiver-er-er

Baby, you burn so hot
You make me shiver with the fire you got
This thing we started, I don't want it to stop
You know you make me shiver

Yeah, you got me singing like

Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up
Give me the shivers
Oh baby, you wanna dance till the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over then we'll bring it right back

(Oh no) And we'll say
Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up
Give me the shivers
Oh baby, you wanna dance till the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over then we'll bring it right back, hey
---------------------------------------------------
Clock strikes upon the hour
And the sun begins to fade
Still enough time to figure out
How to chase my blues away
I've done alright up to now
It's the light of day that shows me how
And when the night falls, loneliness calls

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

I've been in love and lost my senses
Spinning through the town
Sooner or later, the fever ends
And I wind up feeling down

I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Somebody ooo, somebody ooo
Somebody who loves me yeah
Somebody ooo, somebody ooo
To hold me in his arms oh

I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Don't ya wanna dance with me baby
Don't ya wanna dance with me boy
Hey don't ya wanna dance with me baby
With somebody who loves me

Don't ya wanna dance, say you wanna dance, don't ya wanna dance
Don't ya wanna dance, say you wanna dance, don't ya wanna dance
Don't ya wanna dance, say you wanna dance
With somebody who loves me
Dance
---------------------------------------------------
Ugh, you're a monster

I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I'll feel like Godzilla
Better hit the deck like the card dealer
My whole squad's in here, walking around the party
A cross between a zombie apocalypse and B-Bobby "The
Brain" Heenan which is probably the
Same reason I wrestle with mania
Shady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up
Consider it to cross me a costly mistake
If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia
ADHD, Hydroxycut
Pass the Courvoisier (Hey, hey)
In AA with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate
Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday (Ayy)
This beat is cray-cray, Ray J, H-A-H-A-H-A
Laughing all the way to the bank, I spray flames
They cannot tame or placate the

Monster
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet

I'm just a product of Slick Rick and Onyx, told 'em lick the balls
Had 'em just appalled, did so many things that pissed 'em off
It's impossible to list 'em all
And in the midst of all this
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal, voices whisper
My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on a guy with a missile launcher
I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological
Quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of vodka
When you twist the top of the bottle, I'm a

Monster
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet

If you never gave a damn (Ayy), raise your hand
'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans
I'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is
The motherfuckin' finger (Finger), prostate exam ('Xam)
How can I have all these fans and perspire?
Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flyer
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers
And what goes around comes around just like the blades on the chainsaw
'Cause I caught the flack, but my dollars stacked right off the bat like a baseball
Like Kid Ink, bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy
'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake, yeah)
Bitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher
Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her
Face in my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez
Cristhian Rivera, 'cause my lyrics never sit well
So they wanna give me the chair
Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Hari Kari
'Cause e'ry Tom and Dick and Harry carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary on 'em
Swearing up and down they can spit, this shit's hilarious
It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column
We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem
Get the shaft like a steering column (Monster)
Trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink
Evil half of the Bad Meets
Evil, that means take a back seat
Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi single
Look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people
Is my 'Gangsta Bitch' like Apache with a catchy jingle
I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em
Other words, I Minute Maid 'em
I don't wanna hurt 'em, but I did, I'm in a fit of rage
I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade
I'm finna kill 'em and dump all their fuckin' bodies in the lake
Obliterating everything, incinerate a renegade
I'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill
I'm Attila, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla
You're bringin' the killer within me outta me
You don't wanna be the enemy of the demon who entered me
And be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be
Every bit of me's the epitome of a spitter
When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck
Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me
A hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me
I'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you, bitch, I'm unfadable
You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowin' up like an inflatable
I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable
I'm on the toilet bowl, I got a trailer full of money and I'm paid in full
I'm not afraid to pull a—

Man, stop
Look what I'm plannin', haha
---------------------------------------------------
On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
"This could be Heaven or this could be Hell"
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (Any time of year)
You can find it here

Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

So I called up the Captain
"Please bring me my wine."
He said, "We haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine."
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis

Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice
And she said "We are all just prisoners here, of our own device"
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast

Last thing I remember
I was running for the door
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
"Relax," said the night man
"We are programmed to receive
You can check-out any time you like
But you can never leave!"
---------------------------------------------------
I don't always wake up in the mornin'
Pour myself a strong one
Aw, but when I get lonely I do
Your memory gets to burnin'
Lean back on the bourbon
Sure as hell can't keep leanin' on you

Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again
It's all my fault
Yeah, I dropped the ball
You're gone and I'm gone three sheets to the wind
Thinkin' 'bout all

I've wasted on you
All of this time and all of this money
All of these sorrys I don't owe you honey
All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent wasted on you
Wasted on you

Yeah, I swore this one'd be different
My heart wouldn't listen
To my head, and these boots on my feet
Looks like I'm learning the hard way again
That's why I've been

Wasted on you
All of this time and all of this money
All of these sorrys I don't owe you, honey
All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent wasted on you
Wasted on you

Like this pile of your stuff that's packed up in the back
Right down to the flame of this match
Wasted on you, wasted on you
Wasted on you, wasted on you

Wasted on you
All of this time and all of this money
All of these sorrys I don't owe you, honey
All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent wasted on you
Wasted on you, wasted on you
Wasted on you
---------------------------------------------------
B-B-B-B-Bound to fall in love
Bound to fall in love
Uh-huh, honey


All them other niggas lame, and you know it now
When a real nigga hold you down, you s'posed to drown


Bound to fall in love (Bound)
B-B-B-B-Bound to fall in love (Bound)
Uh-huh, honey


What you doin' in the club on a Thursday?
She say she only here for her girl birthday
They ordered champagne but still look thirsty
Rock Forever 21 but just turned thirty
I know I got a bad reputation
Walking-round-always-mad reputation
Leave-a-pretty-girl-sad reputation
Start a Fight Club, Brad reputation
I turnt the nightclub out of the basement
I'll turn the plane around, your ass keep complainin'
How you gon' be mad on vacation?
Dutty wining 'round all these Jamaicans
Uh, this that prom shit
This that what-we-do-don't-tell-your-mom shit
This that red-cup-all-on-the-lawn shit
Got a fresh cut, straight out the salon, bitch


I know you're tired of lovin', of lovin'
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody (Uh-huh, honey)


Close your eyes and let the word paint a thousand pictures
One good girl is worth a thousand bitches
Bound (Bound to fall in love)
Bound (Bound to fall in love)
Uh-huh, honey


I wanna fuck you hard on the sink
After that, give you somethin' to drink
Step back, can't get spunk on the mink
I mean damn, what would Jeromey Romey Romey Rome think?
Hey, you remember where we first met?
Okay, I don't remember where we first met
But hey, admittin' is the first step
And hey, you know ain't nobody perfect
And I know, with the hoes I got the worst rep
But hey, their backstroke I'm tryna perfect
And hey, ayo, we made it: Thanksgivin'
So hey, maybe we can make it to Christmas
She asked me what I wished for on my wishlist
Have you ever asked your bitch for other bitches?
Maybe we could still make it to the church steps
But first, you gon' remember how to forget
After all these long-ass verses
I'm tired, you tired, Jesus wept


I know you're tired of lovin', of lovin'
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody
So just grab somebody, no leavin' this party
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody
Uh-huh, honey


Jerome's in the house, watch your mouth
Jerome's in the house, watch your mouth
Bound to fall in love
Bound
Bound to fall in love
Bound
Uh-huh, honey
---------------------------------------------------
If you, if you could return
Don't let it burn
Don't let it fade
I'm sure I might be rude
But it's just your attitude
It's tearing me apart
It's ruining everything
And I swore, I swore I would be true
And honey, so did you
So why were you holding her hand?
Is that the way we stand?
Were you lying all the time?
Was it just a game to you?

But I'm in so deep
You know I'm such a fool for you
You've got me wrapped around your finger
Do you have to let it linger?
Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?

Oh, I thought the world of you
I thought nothing could go wrong
But I was wrong, I was wrong
If you, if you could get by
Trying not to lie
Things wouldn't be so confused
And I wouldn't feel so used
But you always really knew
I just wanna be with you

And I'm in so deep
You know I'm such a fool for you
You've got me wrapped around your finger
Do you have to let it linger?
Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?

And I'm in so deep
You know I'm such a fool for you
You've got me wrapped around your finger
Do you have to let it linger?
Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?
You know I'm such a fool for you
You've got me wrapped around your finger
Do you have to let it linger?
Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?
---------------------------------------------------
Hold on, hold on, fuck that
Fuck that shit
Hold on, I got to start this motherfuckin' record over again, wait a minute
Fuck that shit
Still on this motherfuckin' record
I'ma play this motherfucker for y'all
Ay, y'all get some more drinks goin' on
I'll sound a whole lot better

Listen
Seein' you got ritualistic
Cleansin' my soul of addiction for now
'Cause I'm fallin' apart, yeah
Tension
Between us just like picket fences
You got issues that I won't mention for now
'Cause we're fallin' apart

Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no

Listen
Harder buildin' trust from a distance
I think we should rule out commitment for now
'Cause we're fallin' apart
Leavin'
You're just doing that to get even
Don't pick up the pieces, just leave it for now
They keep fallin' apart

Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no

Um, trying to think of the right thing to say
---------------------------------------------------
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there, and I thought
"Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?"
Ayy

New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh no

Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
"Oh my God, who is she?"
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't say, I didn't warn ya

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name
---------------------------------------------------
You and me, we made a vow
For better or for worse
I can't believe you let me down
But the proof's in the way it hurts

For months on end I've had my doubts
Denying every tear
I wish this would be over now
But I know that I still need you here

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

You've been so unavailable
Now sadly I know why
Your heart is unobtainable
Even though Lord knows you kept mine

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

I have loved you for many years
Maybe I am just not enough
You've made me realize my deepest fear
By lying and tearing us up

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

I know I'm not the only one
I know I'm not the only one
And I know
And I know
And I know
And I know
And I know
And I don't know
I know I'm not the only one
---------------------------------------------------
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you're the best

I got my red dress on tonight
Dancing in the dark in the pale moonlight
Done my hair up real big beauty queen style
High heels off, I'm feeling alive

Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzling like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothing scares me anymore

(1, 2, 3, 4)

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you're the best

I got that summertime, summertime sadness
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I'm feeling electric tonight
Cruising down the coast going 'bout 99
Got my bad baby by my heavenly side
I know if I go, I'll die happy tonight

Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzling like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothing scares me anymore

(1, 2, 3, 4)

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you're the best

I got that summertime, summertime sadness
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Think I'll miss you forever
Like the stars miss the sun in the morning sky
Later's better than never
Even if you're gone I'm gonna drive (drive, drive)

I got that summertime, summertime sadness
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you're the best

I got that summertime, summertime sadness
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
---------------------------------------------------
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again


Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place (See you in a better place)

When I see you again


Aah oh, aah oh
Wooooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah


First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost
(The love will never get lost)
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone
(Remember me when I'm gone)

How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride


So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home

It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again

When I see you again


Aah oh, aah oh (Uh)
Yeah (Yeah)
Wooooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Yo)
When I see you again (Yo, uh)
See you again (Yo, yo)
Oh-oh (Uh-huh)
(Yup) When I see you again
---------------------------------------------------
Dile que bailando te conoci
(Cuentale)
Dile que esta noche me quieres ver
(Cuentale)
Cuentale que beso mejor que el
(Cuentale)
Dile que esta noche tu me vas a ver
(Cuentale)

Cuentale que te conoci bailando
Cuentale que soy mejor que el
Cuentale que te traigo loca
Cuentale que no lo quieres ver



Que quizas fue la noche la que te traiciono
Fue el perfume de mi piel lo que te cautivo
Que ya no tienes excusa pa' tu traicion
Que tuviste mil motivos, que entre en razon
Que quizas te hablo a el oido como ya el no
O en mi arde el fuego de la pasion
Ya no le mientas mas y admite tu error
Y si es por mi no pidas perdon
Digo
Queda de ti el que lo perdones
El que lo olvides o lo abandones
Porque con llorar no se compone
Entonces a mi dame otra noche

Otra Otra noche otra
(ay que yo no te bote)
Otra Otra noche otra
(Aunque tu vuelvas con el)
Otra Otra noche otra
(Cuentale cuentale)
Otra Otra noche otra
(que beso mejor que el)
Otra Otra noche otra
(Cuentale cuentale)
Otra Otra noche otra

Cuentale que te conoci bailando
Cuentale que soy mejor que el
Cuentale que te traigo loca
Cuentale que tu me quiere ver




Otra Otra noche otra
(Ay que yo no que'o te)
Otra Otra noteo otra
(Aunque tu vuelva con el)
Otra Otra noche otra
(Cuentale cuentale)
Otra Otra noche otra
(Que beso mejor que el)
Otra Otra noche otra
(Cuentale cuentale)
Otra Otra noche otra

Oh life, it's bigger
It's bigger than you
And you are not me
The lengths that I will go to
The distance in your eyes
Oh no, I've said too much
I set it up

That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

Every whisper
Of every waking hour
I'm choosing my confessions
Trying to keep an eye on you
Like a hurt, lost and blinded fool, fool
Oh no, I've said too much
I set it up

Consider this
Consider this, the hint of the century
Consider this, the slip
That brought me to my knees, failed
What if all these fantasies come
Flailing around
Now I've said too much

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

But that was just a dream
That was just a dream

That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

But that was just a dream
Try, cry, why try
That was just a dream
Just a dream
Just a dream, dream
---------------------------------------------------
Used to spend my nights out in a barroom
Liquor was the only love I'd known
But you rescued me from reaching for the bottom
And brought me back from being too far gone

You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

I've looked for love in all the same old places
Found the bottom of the bottle's always dry
But when you poured out your heart I didn't waste it
'Cause there's nothing like your love to get me high

You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time



You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey

You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey
---------------------------------------------------
Do you remember
Happy together?
I do
Don't you?

Then all of a sudden
You're sick to your stomach
Is that
Still true?

Said forever, in the end, I fought it
Please be honest, are we better for it?
Thought you'd hate me but instead you called and
Said, "I miss you," I caught it

Good to each other
Give it the summer
I knew
You too

But I only saw you
Once in December
I'm still
Confused

You said forever and I almost bought it
I miss fighting in your old apartment
Breaking dishes when you're disappointed
I still love you, I promise

Nothing happened in the way I wanted
Every corner of this house is haunted
And I know you said that we're not talking
But I miss you, I'm sorry

I don't wanna go
Think I'll make it worse
Everything I know brings me back to us

I don't wanna go
We been here before
Everywhere I go leads me back to you

I don't wanna go
Think I'll make it worse
Everything I know brings me back to us

I don't wanna go
We been here before
Everywhere I go leads me back to you

I don't wanna go
Think I'll make it worse
Everything I know brings me back to us

I don't wanna go
We been here before
Everywhere I go leads me back to you

I don't wanna go
Think I'll make it worse
Everything I know brings me back to us

I don't wanna go
We been here before
Everywhere I go leads me back to you

Quien lo diria que se podria
Hacer el amor por telepatia
La luna esta llena, mi cama vacia
Lo que yo te haria
Si te tuviera de frente, la mente te la volaria
De noche y de dia, de noche y de dia

You know I'm just a flight away
If you want it, you could take a private plane
A kilometros estamos conectando
Y me prendes aunque no me estes tocando
You know I got a lot to say
All these voices in the background of my brain
Y me dicen todo lo que estas pensando
Me imagino lo que ya estas maquinando

Quien lo diria que se podria
Hacer el amor por telepatia
La luna esta llena, mi cama vacia
Lo que yo te haria
Si te tuviera de frente, la mente te la volaria
De noche y de dia, de noche y de dia

You know that I can see right through you
I can read your mind, I can read your mind
What you wanna do?
It's written all over your face, times two
'Cause I can read your mind, I can read your mind
I can hear your thoughts like a melody
Listen while you talk when you're fast asleep
You stay on the phone just to hear me breathe
(On repeat)

Quien lo diria que se podria
Hacer el amor por telepatia
La luna esta llena, mi cama vacia
Lo que yo te haria
Si te tuviera de frente, la mente te la volaria
De noche y de dia, de noche y de dia

(You know I got a lot to say)
(All these voices in the background of my brain)
---------------------------------------------------
Look at what you've done
Stand still, falling away from me
When it takes so long
Fire's out, what do you want to be?

Now I'm holdin' on
Myself was never enough for me
Gotta be so strong
There's a power in what you do
Now, every other day I'll be watching you

I'll show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside
We did everything right
Now I'm on the outside
I'll show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside
We did everything right
Now I'm on the outside

So, you give me no reason
For me to stay close to you
Tell me what lovers do
How are we still breathing?
It's never for us to choose
I'll be the strength in you

Now I'm holding on (I'm holding on)
Myself was never enough for me
Gotta be so strong
There's a power in what you do
Now, every other day I'll be watching you

I'll show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside
We did everything right
Now I'm on the outside
I'll show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside
We did everything right
Now I'm on the outside

I'll show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside
I'll show you what it feels like

Show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside
We did everything right
Now I'm on the outside
---------------------------------------------------
We might kiss when we are alone
When nobody's watching
We might take it home
We might make out when nobody's there
It's not that we're scared
It's just that it's delicate

So why do you fill my sorrow
With the words you've borrowed
From the only place you've known
And why do you sing Hallelujah
If it means nothing to you
Why do you sing with me at all?

We might live like never before
When there's nothing to give
Well how can we ask for more
We might make love in some sacred place
The look on your face is delicate

So why do you fill my sorrow
With the words you've borrowed
From the only place you've known
And why do you sing Hallelujah
If it means nothing to you
Why do you sing with me at all?

So why do you fill my sorrow
With the words you've borrowed
From the only place you've known
And why do you sing Hallelujah
If it means nothing to you
Why do you sing with me at all?
---------------------------------------------------
Hello
I've waited here for you
Everlong
Tonight
I throw myself into
And out of the red
Out of her head she sang

Come down
And waste away with me
Down with me
Slow how
You wanted it to be
I'm over my head
Out of her head she sang

And I wonder
When I sing along with you
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You gotta promise not to stop when I say when she sang

Breathe out
So I can breathe you in
Hold you in
And now
I know you've always been
Out of your head
Out of my head I sang

And I wonder
When I sing along with you
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You gotta promise not to stop when I say when she sang


So, Dad would take the Sundays off.
And that's the only time he could ever get any rest.
And so, because we were loud on Sundays, he'd make us hold his construction boots over our head, 'til we'd sleep.
And they were really heavy boots and I used to say, "Dad, come on, please."
And like start crying, 'cause they're too heavy.

And I wonder
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when
---------------------------------------------------
You're on the phone with your girlfriend
She's upset, she's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do

I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

But she wears short skirts
I wear T-shirts
She's cheer captain
And I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see
That I'm the one
Who understands you
Been here all along
So, why can't you see
You belong with me
You belong with me

Walk in the streets with you in your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself
"Hey, isn't this easy?"

And you've got a smile
That could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while
Since she brought you down

You say you're fine I know you better than that
Hey, what you doing with a girl like that?

She wears high heels
I wear sneakers
She's cheer captain
And I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see
That I'm the one
Who understands you
Been here all along
So, why can't you see
You belong with me

Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me
You belong with me

Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
I know your favorite songs
And you tell me about your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me

Can't you see
That I'm the one
Who understands you?
Been here all along
So, why can't you see
You belong with me

Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me
You belong with me

You belong with me

Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me?
You belong with me
---------------------------------------------------
Another head hangs lowly
Child is slowly taken
And the violence caused such silence
Who are we mistaken

But you see it's not me
It's not my family
In your head, in your head
They are fighting
With their tanks and their bombs
And their bombs and their guns
In your head, in your head
They are cryin'

In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie, hey, hey
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie, hey, hey, hey, oh

Dou, dou, dou, dou
Dou, dou, dou, dou
Dou, dou, dou, dou
Dou, dou, dou, dou

Another mother's breakin'
Heart is taking over
When the violence causes silence
We must be mistaken

It's the same old theme
Since nineteen-sixteen
In your head, in your head
They're still fightin'
With their tanks and their bombs
And their bombs and their guns
In your head, in your head
They are dyin'

In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie, hey, hey
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie, hey, hey, hey
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Hey, oh, ya, ya-a

No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

It was the best of times, the worst of crimes
I struck a match and blew your mind
But I didn't mean it
And you didn't see it
The ties were black, the lies were white
In shades of gray in candlelight
I wanted to leave him
I needed a reason

"X" marks the spot, where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, I was lying to myself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
We never had a shotgun shot in the dark

You were driving the getaway car
We were flying, but we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
We're riding in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car
No, they never get far
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

It was the great escape, the prison break
The light of freedom on my face
But you weren't thinking
And I was just drinking
Well he was running after us, I was screaming, 'Go, go, go!'
But with three of us, honey, it's a sideshow
And a circus ain't a love story
And now we're both sorry (we're both sorry)

"X" marks the spot, where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, every man for himself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
It hit you like a shotgun shot to the heart

You were driving the getaway car
We were flying, but we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
We're riding in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car
No, they never get far
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

We were jet-set Bonnie and Clyde
Until I switched to the other side
To the other side
It's no surprise, I turned you in
'Cause us traitors never win

I'm in a getaway car
I left you in a motel bar
Put the money in a bag and I stole the keys
That was the last time you ever saw me

Driving the getaway car
We were flying, but we'd never get far (Don't pretend)
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
We're riding in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart (Should've known)
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car
No, they never get far
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

I was riding in a getaway car
I was crying in a getaway car
I was dying in a getaway car
Said 'goodbye' in a getaway car

I was riding in a getaway car
I was crying in a getaway car
I was dying in a getaway car
Said 'goodbye' in a getaway car
---------------------------------------------------
Yeah, I know you see the drip and you like it
Wanna text me, but your pride tryna fight it
I know you young, chasin' love, tryna find it
Then I saw you at a party, started wildin'

I want you, so do you want me?
If I said I love you, would you love me?
I could never dub you, but could you dub me?
I don't wanna fall in love, I don't think it's for me
Hope you know I want you, so do you want me?
If I said I love you, would you love me?
I could never dub you, but could you dub me?
I don't wanna fall in love, I don't think it's for me

I ain't no regular nigga
When we pull up to the party, man, the party get bigger
And she fuckin' with Lil Tecca 'cause she know I'm a winner
I pray to God every day, but I know I'm a sinner
More money, more problems, and the bitches get thicker
Deep throat, shootin' like a free throw
Shawty, she a freak ho, that's my line
Yeah, I want a shawty right now, I know you might now
But I ain't tryna waste no time
She know I'm too wavy
Yeah, I'm that nigga, you cannot replace me
As soon as I met you, you said you wan' date me
I can't say I'm loyal, for you? Baby, maybe
These niggas they hate me 'cause they mad they ain't me
So much hoes around me, I'm getting so lazy
I fuck with you, baby, as long as you make me
Sooner or later, I'll make you my baby
Sooner or later, I'll make you my baby

Yeah, I know you see the drip and you like it
Wanna text me, but your pride tryna fight it
I know you young, chasin' love, tryna find it
Then I saw you at a party, started wildin'

Hope you know I want you, so do you want me?
If I said I love you, would you love me?
I could never dub you, but could you dub me?
I don't wanna fall in love, I don't think it's for me
Hope you know I want you, so do you want me?
If I said I love you, would you love me?
I could never dub you, but could you dub me?
I don't wanna fall in love, I don't think it's for me

I don't think it's for me
I don't think it's for me
I don't think it's for me
I don't think it's for me
---------------------------------------------------
Toss your dirty shoes in my washing-machine heart
Baby, bang it up inside
I'm not wearing my usual lipstick
I thought maybe we would kiss tonight
Baby, will you kiss me already, and
Toss your dirty shoes in my washing-machine heart
Baby, bang it up inside

Baby, though I've closed my eyes
I know who you pretend I am
I know who you pretend I am

But do mi ti
Why not me?
Why not me?
Do mi ti
Why not me?
Why not me?
Do mi ti
Why not me?
Why not me?
---------------------------------------------------
I was so high I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered "Goodbye" as she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart, oh

This love has taken its toll on me
She said "Goodbye" too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice 'cause I won't say "Goodbye" anymore

Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh

I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied, oh
Kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again
But I know

This love has taken its toll on me
She said "Goodbye" too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice 'cause I won't say "Goodbye" anymore

Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh

I'll fix these broken things
Repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's alright
(It's alright, it's alright)
My pressure on your hips
Sinking my fingertips
Into every inch of you
'Cause I know that's what you want me to do

This love has taken its toll on me
She said "Goodbye" too many times before
Her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice 'cause I won't say "Goodbye" anymore

This love has taken its toll on me
She said "Goodbye" too many times before
And my heart is breaking in front of me
She said "Goodbye" too many times before

This love has taken its toll on me
(Oh, yeah, yeah)
She said "Goodbye" too many times before
(Yeah)
And her heart is breaking in front of me
(Yeah)
And I have no choice 'cause I won't say "Goodbye" anymore

This love has taken its toll on me
---------------------------------------------------
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me

You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down

I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

If "Happy Ever After" did exist
I would still be holding you like this

All those fairy tales are full of shit

All those fairy tales are full of it

One more fucking love song, I'll be sick

One more stupid love song, I'll be sick

Oh, you turned your back on tomorrow
'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away

You can't expect me to be fine (Oh-oh)
I don't expect you to care (Yeah)
I know I've said it before
But all of our bridges burned down

I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it "love"
But even the sun sets in paradise

I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you (Oh, oh-oh-oh)
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two? (Yeah)

If "Happy Ever After" did exist
I would still be holding you like this

All those fairy tales are full of shit

All those fairy tales are full of it

One more fucking love song, I'll be sick (Yeah, uh)

One more stupid love song, I'll be sick, oh
Now I'm at a payphone


Yeah, yeah, now baby don't hang up
So I can tell you what you need to know
Baby I'm begging you just please don't go
So I can tell you what you need to know


Man, fuck that shit
I'll be out spending all this money
While you're sitting 'round wondering
Why it wasn't you who came up from nothing
Made it from the bottom
Now when you see me I'm stunting
And all of my cars start with a push of a button
Telling me I changed since I blew up
Or whatever you call it
Switched the number to my phone
So you never could call it
Don't need my name on my shirt
You can tell that I'm balling
Swish, what a shame could have got picked
Had a really good game but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could have saw but sad to say it's over for
Phantom pulled up valet open doors
Wished I'd go away, got what you was looking for
Now it's me who they want, so you can go and take
That little piece of shit with you (Yeah)

I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you (Woo)
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong (Yeah)
Where are the plans we made for two? (Yeah)

If "Happy Ever After" did exist (Oh)
I would still be holding you like this

All those fairy tales are full of shit (Yeah)

All those fairy tales are full of it

One more fucking love song, I'll be sick, oh

One more stupid love song, I'll be sick, yeah
Now I'm at a payphone

Fell in love through photograph
I don't even know your name
Wonder if you'd follow back
I hope to see you one day
I won't show my niggas now
I'II keep this one for myself
Love today's gone digital
And it's messing with my health

Yeah
Damn, I love your sense of humor
You don't get caught up in rumors
You don't be talking 'bout who fucking who
And I notice the way you maneuver
Sexy, but never show too much
Ain't heard from you in like two months
All of a sudden, you pop on my line
You could make time, stop on a dime
I think you mastered the art of sublime
Your type is harder to find
You could turn water to wine
Yeah

Searching for what I could say

The way that I feel in the word
That's different than what you done heard
So many done hit you with game
So many been sent to the curb

Millie tried to talk the pleasure back into being alive
Reminiscing 'bout the apricots and blunts on Peckham Rye
Won't call her friends 'cause she's ashamed of being locked into bed
Can't feel her legs and feeling like a liar at best

You're not alone like you think you are
You're not alone like you think you are
We all have scars, I know it's hard
You're not alone, you're not alone

You're not alone like you think you are
You're not alone like you think you are
We all have scars, I know it's hard
You're not alone, you're not alone

You're not alone, you're not alone

Started sweating bullets when her dad asked, "How d'you really feel?"
She said, "I've been feeling like something inside me wants to scream
Won't call my friends, I'm persuaded that they'll leave in the end
Can't feel my legs, I'm feeling like a liar at best"

You're not alone like you think you are
You're not alone like you think you are
We all have scars, I know it's hard
You're not alone, you're not alone

You're not alone like you think you are
You're not alone like you think you are
We all have scars, I know it's hard
You're not alone, you're not alone

I've often felt like I was born under a bad sign
Wearing suffering like a silk garment or a spot of blue ink
Looking for light and finding a hole where there shouldn't be one
I cannot communicate the depth of the feeling
Truth is I'm still learning to be open about this
But know that I know and you're not alone
You know that I know and you're not alone

You're not alone like you think you are
You're not alone like you think you are
We all have scars, I know it's hard
You're not alone, you're not alone

You're not alone like you think you are
You're not alone like you think you are
We all have scars, I know it's hard
You're not alone, you're not alone
---------------------------------------------------
Take it back, take it back, take it back

You wish you never ever met her at all (Come on!)

(I been around the world I ain't never meet a girl like this)
She's a maneater, a maneater

She's a maneater, a maneater
(I been around the world I ain't never meet a girl like this)
She's a maneater, a maneater

Like this, like this, like this, like this

Shot through the heart and you're to blame
Darling, you give love a bad name

An angel's smile is what you sell
You promised me heaven, then put me through hell
Chains of love got a hold on me
When passion's a prison, you can't break free

Whoa, you're a loaded gun, yeah
Oh, there's nowhere to run
No one can save me, the damage is done

Shot through the heart and you're to blame
You give love a bad name (Bad name)
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name (Bad name)

Blood red nails on your fingertips
A school boy's dream, you act so shy
Your very first kiss was your first kiss goodbye

Whoa, you're a loaded gun
Oh, there's nowhere to run
No one can save me, the damage is done

Shot through the heart and you're to blame

Put your loving hand out, baby
'Cause I'm beggin'

I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, darlin'

Riding high when I was king
I played it hard and fast, 'cause I had everything
I walked away, you won me then
But easy come and easy go and it would end

So, anytime I bleed, you let me go
Yah, anytime I feed, you get me know
Anytime I seek, you let me know
But I planted that seed, just let me go
I'm on my knees when I'm beggin'
'Cause I don't wanna lose you
Hey, yeah, ra-ta-ta-ta!

'Cause I'm beggin', beggin' you
Uh, put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you, ah
And put your loving hand out, darlin'

I need you to understand
Tried so hard to be your man
The kind of man you want in the end
Only then can I begin to live again

An empty shell, I used to be
The shadow of my life was hangin' over me
A broken man that I don't know
Won't even stand the devil's dance to win my soul

What we doin'? What we chasin'?
Why the bottom? Why the basement?
Why we got good shit, don't embrace it?
Why the feel for the need to replace me?
You're the wrong way track from the good
I want to paint a picture tellin' where we could be at
Like a heart in the best way should
You can give it away, you had it and you took the pay
But I keep walkin' on, keep openin' doors
Keep hopin' for, now the door is yours
Keep also home
'Cause I don't want to live in a broken home, girl, I'm beggin'

Mmm, yeah-yeah, yeah, I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, darlin'

I'm fighting hard to hold my own
Just can't make it all alone
I'm holding on, I can't fall back
I'm just a calm, 'bout to fade to black

I'm beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, darlin'
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, darlin'

I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out

Back in black, I hit the sack
I've been too long, I'm glad to be back
Yes, I'm let loose from the noose
That's kept me hanging about
I'm just looking at the sky 'cause it's getting me high
Forget the hearse, 'cause I'll never die
I got nine lives, cat's eyes
Abusing every one of them and running wild

'Cause I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, back
Well, I'm back in black
Yes, I'm back in black

Back in the back of a Cadillac
Number one with a bullet, I'm a power pack
Yes, I'm in a bang with a gang
They've got to catch me if they want me to hang
'Cause I'm back on the track and I'm beatin' the flack
Nobody's gonna get me on another rap
So, look at me now, I'm just making my play
Don't try to push your luck, just get out of my way

'Cause I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, back
Well, I'm back in black
Yes, I'm back in black

Well, I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, yes I'm back

Walk in your rainbow paradise
Strawberry lipstick state of mind
I get so lost inside your eyes
Would you believe it?

You don't have to say you love me
You don't have to say nothing
You don't have to say you're mine

Honey
I'd walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Oh honey
I'd walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do

You're wonder, under summer skies
Brown skin and lemon over ice
Would you believe it?

You don't have to say you love me
I just wanna tell you something
Lately you've been on my mind

Honey
I'd walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Oh honey
I'd walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do

Astro, yeah
Sun is down, freezin' cold
That's how we already know winter's here
My dawg would probably do it for a Louis belt
That's just all he know, he don't know nothin' else
I tried to show 'em, yeah
I tried to show 'em, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Goin' on you with the pick and roll
Young La Flame, he in sicko mode




Woo, made this here with all the ice on in the booth
At the gate outside, when they pull up, they get me loose
Yeah, Jump Out boys, that's Nike boys, hoppin' out coupes
This shit way too big when we pull up give me the loot
(Gimme the loot!)
Was off the Remy, had a Papoose
Had to hit my old town to duck the news
Two four hour lockdown, we made no moves
Now it's 4 AM and I'm back up poppin' with the crew
I just landed in, Chase B mixes pop like Jamba Juice
Different colored chains, think my jeweler really sellin' fruits
And they chokin', man, know the crackers wish it was a noose


Some—some—some, someone said
To win the retreat, we all in too deep
Play-play-playin' for keeps, don't play us for weak (someone said)
To win the retreat, we all in too deep
Play-play-playin' for keeps, don't play us for weak


Yeah, this shit way too formal, y'all know I don’t follow suit
Stacey Dash, most of these girls ain't got a clue
All of these hoes I made off records I produced
I might take all my exes and put 'em all in a group
Hit my eses, I need the bootch
'Bout to turn this function to Bonnaroo
Told her, "Hop in, you comin' too"
In the 305, bitches treat me like I'm Uncle Luke
(Don't stop, pop that pussy!)
Had to slop the top off, it's just a roof, uh
She said, "Where we goin'?" I said, "The moon"
We ain't even make it to the room
She thought it was the ocean, it's just the pool
Now I got her open, it's just the Goose
Who put this shit together? I'm the glue (someone said)




(Someone said)

---------------------------------------------------
Take a seat
Right over there, sat on the stairs
Stay or leave
The cabinets are bare and I'm unaware
Of just how we got into this mess
Got so aggressive
I know we meant all good intentions

So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close
Why don't you come on over
I can't just let you go

Oh baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle
In the middle
Baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle
In the middle

Take a step
Back for a minute, into the kitchen
Floors are wet
And taps are still running, dishes are broken
How did we get into this mess
Got so aggressive
I know we meant all good intentions

So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close
Why don't you come on over
I can't just let you go

Oh baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle
In the middle

Looking at you I can't lie
Just pouring out admission
Regardless my objection
And it's not about my pride
I need you on my skin just
Come over, pull me in just

Oh baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle
In the middle, no no

Baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle, oh yeah
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle, oh
In the middle
Baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle, baby
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle, middle
In the middle, middle
---------------------------------------------------
Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling is vulturous
Negative, nepotist

Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this

Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

Whatever it takes
Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah take me to the top I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible

Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of them
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
I was born to run, I was born for this

Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

Whatever it takes
Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah take me to the top, I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working hard on something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system of catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I'll go down to the grave and die happily
And leave the body and my soul to be a part of thee
I do what it takes

Whatever it takes
Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah take me to the top, I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes
---------------------------------------------------
Yeah
Breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things

Yeah
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who would have thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)

My wrist, stop watchin'
My neck is flossy
Make big deposits
My gloss is poppin'

You like my hair?
Gee, thanks! Just bought it
I see it, I like it
I want it, I got it
Yeah

I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it

You like my hair?
Gee, thanks! Just bought it
I see it, I like it
I want it, I got it
(Yep)

Wearin' a ring but ain't gon' be no "Mrs."
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction

Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, "Which one?" I say, "Nah, I want all of 'em"
Happiness is the same price as "red-bottoms"

My smile is beamin' (yeah)
My skin is gleamin' (is gleamin')
The way it shine
I know you've seen it
You've seen it

I bought a crib
Just for just for the closet closet
Both his and hers
I want it, I got it
Yeah

I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
Baby

You like my hair?
Gee, thanks! Just bought it
Oh, yeah
I see it, I like it
I want it, I got it
Yep

Yeah, my receipts be lookin' like phone numbers
If it ain't money, then wrong number
Black Card is my business card
The way it be settin' the tone for me

I don't mean to brag
But I be like, "Put it in the bag"
Yeah
When you see them racks
They stacked up like my ass
Yeah

Shoot
Go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop
Gimme the loot
Never mind, I got the juice
Nothin' but net when we shoot

Look at my neck
Look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it then that's what I get
Yeah

I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
(Oh yeah)
Yeah
I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
Oh, yeah, yeah

You like my hair?
Gee, thanks! Just bought it
I see it, I like it
I want it, I got it
(I see, yep)
---------------------------------------------------
E equals MC squared
I got a blip inside my head
Flew over the cuckoo's nest
The lights are on, there's no one here
Puffing with the dragons
I'm livin' for the thrill, formula

Screws loose (on a Monday)
Screws loose (where's the propane?)
Screws loose (tell 'em)
Screws loose (tell 'em)
Screws loose (tell 'em)
I'm livin' for the thrill, formula (tell 'em)
(Puffing with the dragons)

Screws loose (tell 'em)
I'm livin' for the thrill, formula (Screws loose)
Screws loose
---------------------------------------------------
I see the bad moon a-rising
I see trouble on the way
I see earthquakes and lightning
I see bad times today

Don't go around tonight
Well, it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise

I hear hurricanes a-blowing
I know the end is coming soon
I fear rivers overflowing
I hear the voice of rage and ruin

Don't go around tonight
Well, it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise

All right

Hope you got your things together
Hope you are quite prepared to die
Looks like we're in for nasty weather
One eye is taken for an eye

Well, don't go around tonight
Well, it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise

Don't come around tonight
Well, it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise
---------------------------------------------------
Nah, but, listen, I'm following my dreams, I'm chasing my, my, my, my dreams, uhm, accomplishing all my goals. I'm doing what I'm supposed to do. And that's, you know, niggas, they always gonna be there

Really hate saying sorry
Gotta be another way
I know you hurt regardless
Tryna take away the pain
I know I've done some foolish things before
I know that I've been swerving on this course
Checking myself, cause I just can't ignore, oh, oh

Can find me somewhere writing when I’m wrong
Girl, I'm just tryna see if I belong
Mistakes feel like a fracture in my bones

Sitting here, patching myself up
Crying over what's left, cause
Without you I ain't shit, but no pressure
Guess I gotta learn my lesson

We over the same shit
Swinging for the fence, but somehow I can't hit
You wonder why I came here
Despite a couple kinks, don't no shame hang here
I know I've said some foolish things before
I know that I've been swerving on this course
A lot of shit that you just can't ignore, oh, oh, oh

Can find me somewhere writing when I’m wrong
Girl, I'm just tryna see if I belong
Mistakes feel like a fracture in my bones
Do all this work only to fuck it up
But I'm not down for quitting on your love
It's twisted but I just can't get enough

Sitting here, patching myself up
Crying over what's left, cause
Without you I ain't shit, but no pressure
Guess I gotta learn my lesson

So I'ma write, when I'm wrong
Haven't I already shown
What it's like to love someone so much
You treat their heart like it was your own

Sitting here, patching myself up
Crying over what's left, cause
Without you I ain't shit, but no pressure
Guess I gotta learn my lesson

Rights, wrongs
I'm just tryna s-, oh
It feels like a fracture of bones, oh, oh
---------------------------------------------------
Can't stop, addicted to the shindig
Chop Top, he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation

Defunct, the pistol that you pay for
This punk, the feelin' that you stay for
In time I want to be your best friend
East side love is living on the West End

Knocked out, but, boy, you better come to (Oh, oh-oh)
Don't die, you know, the truth as some do (Oh-oh)
Go write your message on the pavement (Oh-oh)
Burn so bright, I wonder what the wave meant

White heat is screamin' in the jungle (Oh, oh-oh)
Complete the motion if you stumble (Oh-oh)
Go ask the dust for any answers (Oh-oh)
Come back strong with fifty belly dancers

The world I love, the tears I drop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you?
The world I love, the trains I hop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to

Sweetheart is bleeding in the snow cone
So smart, she's leadin' me to ozone
Music, the great communicator
Use two sticks to make it in the nature

I'll get you into penetration
The gender of a generation
The birth of every other nation
Worth your weight, the gold of meditation

This chapter's gonna be a close one (Oh, oh-oh)
Smoke rings, I know you're gonna blow one (Oh-oh)
All on a spaceship, persevering (Oh-oh)
Use my hands for everything but steering

Can't stop the spirits when they need you (Oh, oh-oh)
Mop tops are happy when they feed you (Oh-oh)
J. Butterfly is in the treetop (Oh-oh)
Birds that blow the meaning into bebop

The world I love, the tears I drop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you?
The world I love, the trains I hop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to

Wait a minute, I'm passin' out
Win or lose, just like you
Far more shockin'
Than anything I ever knew
How 'bout you?
Ten more reasons why I need
Somebody new, just like you
Far more shockin'
Than anything I ever knew
Right on cue

Can't stop, addicted to the shindig
Chop Top, he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation

Defunct, the pistol that you pay for (Oh, oh-oh)
This punk, the feelin' that you stay for (Oh-oh)
In time I want to be your best friend (Oh-oh)
East side love is living on the West End

Knocked out, but boy, you better come to (Oh, oh-oh)
Don't die, you know, the truth is some do (Oh-oh)
Go write your message on the pavement (Oh-oh)
Burn so bright, I wonder what the wave meant

Kick start the golden generator
Sweet talk but don't intimidate her
Can't stop the gods from engineering
Feel no need for any interfering

Your image in the dictionary
This life is more than ordinary
Can I get two, maybe even three of these?
Comin' from the space to teach you of the Pleiades

Can't stop the spirits when they need you
This life is more than just a read-through
---------------------------------------------------
'Cause sometimes you just feel tired
Yo, left, yo, left
Feel weak and when you feel weak
Yo, left, right, left
You feel like you wanna just give up
Yo, left, yo left
But you gotta search within you
Yo, left, right, left
Try to find that inner strength and just pull that shit out of you
Yo, left, yo left
And get that motivation to not give up
Yo, left, right, left
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad
Yo, left, yo left
You wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse
Yo, left, right, left

'Til I collapse I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em
'Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pennin' 'em
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin' 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal, cop-killin', hip-hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're comin' with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?
Fa' shizzle, my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck

'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
Until the roof, until the roof
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
Until my legs, until my legs
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
Give out from underneath me

Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get
When you real and you spit, and people are feelin' your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes: Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
Andre from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney — Nate, hit me!

'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
Until the roof, until the roof
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
Until my legs, until my legs
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
Give out from underneath me

Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll prob'ly never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em
The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?
'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so

'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
Until the roof, until the roof
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
Until my legs, until my legs
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
Give out from underneath me

Until the roof, until the roof
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
Until my legs, until my legs
Give out from underneath me
I, I will not fall, I will stand tall
Feels like no one could beat me
---------------------------------------------------
I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (Oh!)

But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

I don't like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You asked me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast (What?)
The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours

But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams

(Ooh, look what you made me do)
(Look what you made me do)
(Look what you just made me do)
"I'm sorry, the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now."
(Look what you just made me do)
(Look what you made me do)
(Look what you made me do)
"Why?"
(Look what you just made me do)
"Oh, 'cause she's dead!" (Oh!)

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do
---------------------------------------------------
Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holdin' him for ransom, some
Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all though
Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta

I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it?

Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist, and
We'll move to an island, and
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now, now

I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know (No one has to know)

In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it?
Oh, are you ready for it?

Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin

I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

In the middle of the night (Night), in my dreams (My dreams)
You should see the things we do (We do), baby (Baby), hmm (Eh)
In the middle of the night, in my dreams (My dreams)
I know I'm gonna be with you (I know I'm gonna be with you)
So I take my time
In the middle of the night

Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Are you ready for it?
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Are you ready for it?
---------------------------------------------------
When you try your best, but you don't succeed
When you get what you want, but not what you need
When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse
And the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone, but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

And high up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try you'll never know
Just what you're worth

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

Tears stream down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Tears stream down your face and I
Tears stream down your face
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
Tears stream down your face and I

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you
---------------------------------------------------
You call me again, drunk in your Benz
Drivin' home under the influence
You scared me to death, but I'm wastin' my breath
'Cause you only listen to your fuckin' friends
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city

And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fuckin' sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends
So I shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid

You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just fuckin' leave me alone
---------------------------------------------------
Oh, ey

You don't know babe
When you hold me
And kiss me slowly
It's the sweetest thing
And it don't change
If I had it my way
You would know that you are

You're the coffee that I need in the morning
You're my sunshine in the rain when it's pouring
Won't you give yourself to me
Give it all, oh


I just wanna see
I just wanna see how beautiful you are
You know that I see it
I know you're a star
Where you go I'll follow
No matter how far
If life is a movie
Oh you're the best part, oh
You're the best part, oh
Best part


It's this sunrise
And those brown eyes, yes
You're the one that I desire
When we wake up
And then we make love
It makes me feel so nice

You're my water when I'm stuck in the desert
You're the Tylenol I take when my head hurts
You're the sunshine on my life


I just wanna see how beautiful you are
You know that I see it
I know you're a star
Where you go I'll follow
No matter how far
If life is a movie
Then you're the best part, oh
You're the best part, oh
Best part

If you love me won't you say something
If you love me won't you
Won't you
If you love me won't you say something
If you love me won't you
Love me, won't you
If you love me won't you say something
If you love me won't you
If you love me won't you say something
If you love me won't you
Love me, won't you
If you love me won't you say something
If you love me won't you
If you love me won't you say something
If you love me won't you
Love me, won't you

And they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
They wishin' on me, yeah

Don't pull up at 6 AM to cuddle with me
You know how I like it when you lovin' on me

They're rotting my brain, love
These hoes are the same

I admit it, another hoe got me finished
Broke my heart, oh no you didn't
Fuck sippin', I'mma down a whole bottle
Hard liquor, hard truth can't swallow
Need a bartender, put me out my sorrow
Wake up the next day in the Monte Carlo
With a new woman
Tell me she from Colorado
And she love women
She'll be gone by tomorrow
Who am I kiddin'
All this jealousy and agony that I sit in
I'm a jealous boy, really feel like John Lennon
I just want real love, guess it's been a minute
Pissed off from the way that I don't fit in, I don't fit in
Tell me what's the secret to love, I don't get it
Feel like I be runnin' a race I'm not winnin'
Ran into the devil today and she grinnin'

Hey, these girls are insane
All girls are the same
They're rotting my brain, love
Think I need a change
Before I go insane, love
All girls are the same
They're rotting my brain, love
Think I need a change
Before I go insane, love

Ten minutes, she told me it would take ten minutes
To break my heart, oh no she didn't
Fuck living, Imma drown in my sorrow
Fuck giving, Imma take not borrow
And I'm still sinnin'
I'm still losing my mind
I know I been trippin'
I'm still wasting my time
All the time given, am I dying, am I living
It's fuck feelin's, my sorrow go up to the ceilin'

Now I am insane
Demons in my brain, love
Peace I can't obtain
Cause all these girls the same, love
Now I am insane
Demons in my brain, love
Peace I can't obtain
Cause all these girls the same, love

I was a liar
I gave in to the fire
I know I should've fought it
At least I'm being honest
Feel like a failure
'Cause I know that I failed you
I should've done you better
'Cause you don't want a liar

And I know, and I know, and I know
She gives you everything
But, boy, I couldn't give it to you
And I know, and I know, and I know
That you got everything
But I got nothing here without you

So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise, after that, I'll let you go
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home

I don't deserve it
I know I don't deserve it
But stay with me a minute
I swear I'll make it worth it
Can't you forgive me?
At least just temporarily
I know that this is my fault
I should've been more careful

And I know, and I know, and I know
She gives you everything
But, boy, I couldn't give it to you
And I know, and I know, and I know
That you got everything
But I got nothing here without you, baby

So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time

Oh, woah, oh
Oh, oh

You got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we will make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothing to prove
You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
I've been working at a convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
We won't have to drive too far
Just across the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living

You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
We leave tonight or live and die this way

So I remember we were driving, driving in your car
The speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
And I, I had a feeling that I could be someone
Had a feeling that I could be someone

You see, my old man's got a problem
He lives with the bottle, that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
I say, his body's too young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did
You got a fast car
And we go cruising to entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
We leave tonight or live and die this way

So I remember we were driving, driving in your car
The speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
And I, I had a feeling that I could be someone
Had a feeling that I could be someone
---------------------------------------------------
Love's gonna get you killed
But pride's gonna be the death of you and you and me
And you and you and you and me
And you and you and you and me
And you and you and you and me and-


Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
(In another life, I surely was there)
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
(I care, I care)


Hell-raising, wheel-chasing, new worldly possessions
Flesh-making, spirit-breaking, which one would you lessen?
The better part, the human heart
You love 'em or dissect 'em
Happiness or flashiness? How do you serve the question?
See, in a perfect world, I would be perfect, world
I don't trust people enough beyond their surface, world
I don't love people enough to put my faith in man
I put my faith in these lyrics, hoping I make a band
I understand I ain't perfect
I probably won't come around
This time, I might put you down
Last time, I ain't give a fuck, I still feel the same now
My feelings might go numb, you're dealing with cold thumb
I'm willing to give up a leg and arm to show empathy from
Pity parties and functions of you and yours
A perfect world, you probably live another 24
I can't fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure
I can't fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure


Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
In another life, I surely was there
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
(I care, I care)


Maybe I wasn't there (We saw you first)
Maybe I wasn't there (I saw you first)
Maybe I wasn't there (I saw you first)
Maybe I wasn't there


Now, in a perfect world, I probably won't be insensitive
Cold as December, but never remember what winter did
I wouldn't blame you for mistakes I made or the bed I laid
Seems like I point the finger just to make a point nowadays
Smiles and cold stares, the temperature goes there
Indigenous disposition, feel like we belong here
I know the walls, they can listen, I wish they could talk back
The hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that
Sick venom in men and women overcome with pride
A perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies
Promises are broken and more resentment come alive
Race barriers make inferior of you and I
See, in a perfect world, I'll choose faith over riches
I'll choose work over bitches, I'll make schools out of prison
I'll take all the religions and put 'em all in one service
Just to tell 'em we ain't shit, but He's been perfect, world


Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
(In another life, I surely was there)
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
(I care, I care)


Maybe I wasn't there (We saw you first)
Maybe I wasn't there (I saw you first)
Maybe I wasn't there (I saw you first)
Maybe I wasn't there
