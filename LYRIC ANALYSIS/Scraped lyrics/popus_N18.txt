Thought I'd end up with Sean
But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about Ricky
Now I listen and laugh
Even almost got married
And for Pete, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, "Thank you" to Malcolm
'Cause he was an angel

One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
Say I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
So, look what I got
Look what you taught me
And for that, I say

Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
I'm so fuckin'...

Spend more time with my friends
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Plus, I met someone else
We havin' better discussions
I know they say I move on too fast
But this one gon' last
'Cause her name is Ari
And I'm so good with that (So good with that)

She taught me love (Love)
She taught me patience (Patience)
How she handles pain (Pain)
That shit's amazing (Yeah, she's amazing)
I've loved and I've lost (Yeah, yeah)
But that's not what I see (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause look what I've found (Yeah, yeah, I've found)
Ain't no need for searching, and for that, I say

Thank you, next (Thank you, next)
Thank you, next (Thank you, next)
Thank you, next (Thank you)

Thank you, next (Thank you, next)
Thank you, next (Said thank you, next)
Thank you, next (Next)
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex

Thank you, next
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
I'm so fucking...

One day I'll walk down the aisle
Holding hands with my mama
I'll be thanking my dad
'Cause she grew from the drama
Only wanna do it once, real bad
Gon' make that shit last
God forbid something happens
Least this song is a smash (Song is a smash)

I've got so much love (Love)
Got so much patience (Patience)
And I've learned from the pain (Pain)
I turned out amazing (Turned out amazing)
Say I've loved and I've lost (Yeah, yeah)
But that's not what I see (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause look what I've found (Yeah, yeah)
Ain't no need for searching
And for that, I say

Cuenta que no quiere pero me tiene espionaje, eh-eh

He said he wants to touch it, and tease it, and squeeze it
Well my piggy bank is hungry, my nigga, you need to feed it
If the text ain't freaky, I don't wanna read it
And just to let you know, this punani is undefeated
Aye
He said he really wanna see me more
I said we should have a date, where? At the Lamborghini store
"I'm kinda scary, hard to read, I'm like a Ouija board"
"But I'm a boss bitch, who you gonna leave me for?"
You hoes got no class, you bitches is broke still

I'm a whole rich bitch, and I work like I'm broke still (Cardi)
But the love be so fake, but the hate be so real (uh)

Work it, keep it tight every day
And I, I, I know you need a taste
When I ooh, you're fallin' in love
Give a little ooh-ooh, get it well done
Dancing on my ooh, make your girl wanna run

Blow out your candles, have a siesta
They can try pero no one can stop me
What my taki taki wants, ya my taki taki gets, uh

Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier
I want you to be happier

When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day, we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that the story ends

Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier
I want you to be happier

When the evening falls
And I'm left there with my thoughts
And the image of you being with someone else
Well, it's eating me up inside

But we ran our course, we pretended we're OK
Now if we jump together at least we can swing
Far away from the wreck we made

Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier
I want you to be happier

So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go

Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier
I want you to be happier
Even though I might not like this
I think that you'll be happier
I want you to be happier

Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier
I want you to be happier

So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go

Found you when your heart was broke
I filled your cup until it overflowed
Took it so far to keep you close (keep you close)
I was afraid to leave you on your own

I said I'd catch you if you fall (fall)
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (all)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feeling so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinking you could live without me
Thinking you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (yeah, I don't know why)
Thinking you could live without me
Live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (I don't know why, yeah, yeah)

Gave love 'bout a hundred tries (hundred tries)
Just running from the demons in your mind
Then I took yours and made 'em mine (mine)
I didn't notice 'cause my love was blind

Said I'd catch you if you fall (fall)
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (all)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feeling so high but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinking you could live without me
Thinking you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (yeah, I don't know why)
Thinking you could live without me
Live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why, yeah

You don't have to say just what you did (what you did)
I already know (I know)
I had to go and find out from them (oh-woah)
So tell me, how's it feel? (oh-woah)

Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feeling so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinking you could live without me
Thinking you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (yeah, I don't know why)

No-no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead (Uh, uh, uh)
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heartbreak

You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (Can't take back the love that I gave you)
You made my heart break (Were made outta plastic, fake)
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break again (I was tangled up in your drastic ways)
(Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?)

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
Easier said than done, I thought you were—
—instead of my head
You found another— better one
I won't let you forget me

A little bit psycho
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind."

See, someone said, "Don't drink her potions
She'll kiss your neck with no emotions
When she's mean, you know you love it
She tastes so sweet. Don't sugarcoat it."

No, no
You'll play along,
Let her lead you on
You'll be saying, "No (no, no, no), no (no)."

---------------------------------------------------
Don't you know I'm no good for you?
I've learned to lose you can't afford to
Tore my shirt to stop you bleeding
But nothing ever stops you leaving

Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

Don't you know too much already?
I'll only hurt you if you let me
Call me friend, but keep me closer
(Call me back)
And I'll call you when the party's over

Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
Yeah, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

But nothing is better, sometimes
Once we've both said our goodbyes
Let's just let it go
Let me let you go

Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

You probably think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everythin', whoa

I did not believe that it would end, no
Everything came second to the Benzo
You're not even speakin' to my friends, no
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were lookin' forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
And now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget
But I can't get this shit outta my head

You probably think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everythin', whoa

Better now, better now, yeah
I'm b-b-b-b-better now, better now, yeah
I'm b-b-b-b-better now, better now, yeah
I'm b-b-b-b-better now, better now
Ooh, yeah

Running just to feel the
Night in our head for a while
It's foolish, I know
Chasing the moon between the buildings
Wouldn't it be nice
To howl just once

Suddenly I'm free
Of every heavy thing
The pain, the hurt
The sorrow, it leaves me
We run, quicksilver in the moonlight

We don't need words to speak
Just the electricity
Of silence around us
My heart calls out to you
Like a song of the sea
Trapped inside a shell

Suddenly I'm free
Of every heavy thing
The pain, the hurt
The sorrow, it leaves me
We run, quicksilver in the moonlight
Quicksilver in the moonlight

Years from now
Still see you shining in the night
Years from now
Still see you shining in the night
Years from now
Still see you shining in the night
Years from now

Watch as the sun rises
To change the magic in the air
From black to blue to gold
We walk beneath the sun
As the city inhales
And stars all over again

Once we were free
Of every heavy thing
The pain, the hurt
The sorrow that's in me
We run, quicksilver in the moonlight
---------------------------------------------------

Tu jeva me vio y se fue de pecho como Jimmy Snuka (ah)
Te vamos a tumbar la peluca
Y arranca pa'l carajo cabron, que a ti no te vo'a pasar la hookah (hookah, hookah)
Mis tenis Balenciaga, me reciben en la entrada (woo)
Pa-pa-pa-parazzi, like I'm Lady Gaga (woo)
Y no te me hagas (ey)
Que en cover de Billboard tu has visto mi cara (ey)
No salgo de tu mente
Donde quieras que viajes has escuchado "Mi Gente"
Yo no soy high (high), soy como el Testarossa ('rossa)
Yo soy el que se la vive y tambien el que la goza (goza, goza)
Es la cosa, mami es la cosa (cosa, cosa)
El que mira sufre y el que toca goza (goza, goza)


I said I like it like that
(I said I like it like that)
I said I like it like that
(I said I like it like that)


Diamond district in the chain (I said I like it like that)
Certified, you know I'm gang (I said I like it like)
Drop the top and blow the brains (I said I like it like that)
Oh he's so handsome, what's his name? (I said I like it)
---------------------------------------------------
Thought I found a way
Thought I found a way out (found)
But you never go away (never go away)
So I guess I gotta stay now

Oh, I hope someday I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear

Isn't it lovely? All alone
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home

Walking out of time
Looking for a better place (looking for a better place)
Something's on my mind
Always in my head space

But I know someday I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive outside I can't fight my fear

Isn't it lovely? All alone
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello. Welcome home

Whoa, yeah
Yeah, ah
Whoa, whoa
Hello, welcome home

Y te miro to’ el dia a ver cuando es la hora
Para acercarme; quiero sentirte, quiero mirarte, ma'
Para hablarte; quiero contarte, quiero explicarte, ma'
Que no soy alguien interesante, solo un cobarde mas
Que hizo bastante para este dia poderse acercar, mama

You got the nerve to come and say
That you're not standing in my way
When we both know that you're not who you say you are
And you're a mess
And you know it
Even though you try real hard still show it
Still show it

You can't take it back
With all I tried
All I know's that you can't shape me

I've been up and I've been down
And I was kinda hoping
You could be my hero
You could be my hero
Well I've had high hopes up till now
And I was kinda hoping
You could be my hero
You could be my hero

Are we ok, we alright?
Heard you've been having sleepless nights
Now I know that we can't go back
Back to how things used to be

Seasons still change
But you'll still be the same

You can't take it back
With all I tried
All I know's that you can't shape me

I've been up and I've been down
And I was kinda hoping
You could be my hero
You could be my hero
Well I've had high hopes up till now
And I was kinda hoping
You could be my hero
You could be my hero

Seasons still change
But you'll still be the same
You'll be the same

You can't take it back
With all I've tried
And I know that you can't shape me

I've been up and I've been down
And I was kinda hoping
You could be my hero
You could be my hero
Well I've had high hopes up till now
And now I've realised
You'll never be my hero
Never be my hero

(Never be my hero)

You'll never be my hero
---------------------------------------------------
(But tonight is your special night to do something magical)

Some days, things just take way too much of my energy
I look up and the whole room's spinning
You take my cares away
I can so over-complicate, people tell me to medicate

Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
I know that all this shit's fabricated, mmm
Time goes by and I can't control my mind
Don't know what else to try, but you tell me every time

Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin'
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin', mmm

Sometimes it's hard to find, find my way up into the clouds
Tune it out, they can be so loud
You remind me of a time when things weren't so complicated
All I need is to see your face

Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
I know that all this shit's fabricated, mmm
Time goes by and I can't control my mind
Don't know what else to try, but you tell me every time

Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, I keep on breathin'
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, I keep on breathin', mmm, yeah

My, my air
My, my air
My, my air, my air
My, my air
My, my air
My, my air, yeah

Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, I keep on breathin'
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, I keep on breathin', mmm, yeah

Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin', oh, whoa
I keep on breathin', oh yeah
Time goes by and I can't control my mind
I keep on breathin', mmm, yeah
---------------------------------------------------
I should've stayed with you last night
Instead of going out to find trouble
That's just trouble (yeah)
I think I run away sometimes
Whenever I get too vulnerable
That's not your fault (yeah)

See, I wanna stay the whole night
I wanna lay with you 'til the sun's up
I wanna let you inside
Oh, heaven knows I've tried

I wish that I could let you love
Wish that I could let you love me
Wish that I could let you love
Wish that I could let you love me

Say, what's the matter, what's the matter with me?
What's the matter with me?
Oh, I wish that I could let you love
Wish that I could let you love me now

I wish, oh, I wish, oh, I wish, oh, I wish, I
I wish, oh, I wish, oh, I wish, oh, I wish, I

And every time it gets too real
And every time I feel like sabotaging
I start running again
And every time I push away
I really wanna say that I'm sorry (yeah)
But I say nothing (yeah)

See, I wanna stay the whole night
I wanna lay with you 'til the sun's up
I wanna let you inside
Oh, heaven knows I've tried

I wish that I could let you love
Wish that I could let you love me
Wish that I could let you love
Wish that I could let you love me

Say, what's the matter, what's the matter with me?
What's the matter with me?
Oh, I wish that I could let you love
Wish that I could let you love me now

I wish, oh, I wish, oh, I wish, oh, I wish, I
I wish, oh, I wish, oh, I wish, oh, I wish, I

I wanna stay with you 'til the morning
I wanna lay with you through the sunrise
I wanna show you that you're my only
I wanna lay with you 'til the sun's up

I wanna stay with you 'til the morning
I wanna lay with you through the sunrise, through the sunrise
Oh, heaven knows I've tried

I wish that I could let you love
Wish that I could let you love me
Wish that I could let you love
Wish that I could let you love me

Say, what's the matter, what's the matter with me?
What's the matter with me?
Oh, I wish that I could let you love
Oh, I wish that I could let you love me

Say, what's the matter, what's the matter with me?
What's the matter with me?
Oh, I wish that I could let you love
Wish that I could let you love me now

I wish, oh, I wish, oh, I wish, oh, I wish, I
I wish, oh, I wish, oh, I wish, oh, I wish, I

I always say what I'm feeling
I was born without a zip on my mouth
Sometimes I don't even mean it
It takes a little while to figure me out


I like my coffee with two sugars in it
High heels and my jewellery dripping
Drink and I get all fired up
(Hey hey hey)
Insecure but I'm working with it
Many things that I could get rid of
Ain't about to give it up


I made a few mistakes, I regret it nightly
I broke a couple hearts that I wear on my sleeve
My momma always said "Girl, you're trouble" and
And now I wonder, could you fall for a woman like me


And every time we touch, boy you make me feel weak
I can tell you're shy and I think you're so sweet
Spending every night under covers and
Still I wonder, could you fall for a woman like me

(A woman)


Woman like me, like a woman like me
La-la-la woman like me, like a woman like me
La-la-la woman like, like a woman like me
La-la-la woman like me, like a woman like me


And baby, just be mine for the weekend
We can get a takeaway and sit on the couch
Or we could just go out for the evening
Hopefully end up with you kissing my mouth, eh eh


You got them blue jeans with a rip up in them
My hair with your fingers in it
Love it when you turn me on
'Yonce with a little bit of
"Love Drunk" in the middle with it
Get down to our favorite song


I made a few mistakes, I regret it nightly
I broke a couple hearts that I wear on my sleeve
My momma always said "Girl, you're trouble" and
And now I wonder, could you fall for a woman like me


And every time we touch, boy you make me feel weak
I can tell you're shy and I think you're so sweet
Spending every night under covers and
Still I wonder, could you fall for a woman like me

Knotted up, he could afford to ice me (Hh, rhrr)
Tell 'em there's a bad Trini bitch inna your area (Uh)
But the more bad bitches, then the more merrier (C'mon)
Baddies to my left and to the right a little scarier (Uh)
Rude boy, tell me, can you handle all this derriere? (Da derriere, rhrr)
Uh, a million I'm getting my billy on
Greatest of all time, 'cause I'm a chameleon
I switch it up for every era, I'm really bomb
These bitches really wanna be Nicki, I'm really mom (Uh)

Now, now watch me fly, fly
Now watch me fly, fly
You can't tell me I ain't fly
I know I'm super fly, I know I'm super fly...

Run that back, Turbo


You can get the biggest Chanel bag in the store if you want it
I gave 'em the drip, they sucked it up, I got 'em moanin'
I bought a new Patek, I had the watch, so I two-toned 'em
Takin' these drugs, I'm gon' be up until the mornin'
That ain't your car, you just a leaser, you don't own it
If I'm in the club, I got that fire when I'm performin'
The backend just came in, in all hundreds
Fives galore, cute shit, they all on us
I'm from Atlanta where young niggas run shit
I know they hatin' on me, but I don't read comments
Whenever I tell her to come, she comin'
Whenever it's smoke, we ain't runnin'


Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind
Soon as I get back, she gettin' slayed
Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise
Every other night, another movie gettin' made
Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind
Soon as I get back, she gettin' slayed
Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise (yeah)
Every other night, another movie gettin' made


Yeah, every other night, another dollar gettin' made
Every other night started with a good day
I feel like a child, I got boogers in the face
Diamonds dancin' in the dark like this shit is a parade
I don't want your chain, Young GonWunna not a slave
I had to draw the line, too many bitches gettin' saved
TSA harass me, so I took a private plane
These pussy niggas lackin', why I'm workin' on my aim
Drip too hard (too hard), charge it to the card (to the card)
Designer to the ground, I can barely spell the names
Drip too hard, caution on the floor
You gon' fuck around and drown tryna ride a nigga wave


Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind
Soon as I get back, she gettin' slayed
Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise
Every other night, another movie gettin' made
Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind
Soon as I get back, she gettin' slayed
Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise
Every other night, another movie gettin' made

Funny how they shook, ayy, got these niggas shook
Pullin' back the curtain by myself, take a look, ayy
I'm a bar spitta, I'm a hard hitta
Yeah I'm light-skinned, but I'm still a dark nigga

Somethin' wrong with 'em, got 'em all bitter

Future took the business and ran it for me
I let Ollie take the owl, told him brand it for me
I get 2 million a pop and that's standard for me
Like I went blind, dog, you gotta hand it to me

Money for revenge, man, that's hardly an expense

---------------------------------------------------
We don't wanna believe it, that it's all gone
Just a matter of minutes, before the sun goes down
We're afraid to admit it, but I know you know, know that
We should've known better, we kept on trying
I just stand now and see it, the fire's dying out
Can't believe that I see this, we're out of chances now
And I just want you to know that

You and me it was good but it wasn't right
And it'll be hard but I know I will make it out
Step by step, I'll move on and get on with life
So I let go, and I hope you'll be happy now
You and me it was good but it wasn't right
And it'll be hard but I know I will make it out
Step by step I'll move on and get on with life
So I let go, and I hope you'll be happy now

I hope you'll be happy now
Yeah, I hope you'll be happy now
I hope you'll be happy now
Yeah, I hope you'll be happy now
Yeah, I hope you'll be happy now
I hope you'll be happy now

Thought we would make it, if I just held on
But it's really crazy, how love could fade so fast
We said "forever", but now we're in the past
And I just want you to know that

You and me it was good but it wasn't right
And it'll be hard but I know I will make it out
Step by step I'll move on and get on with life
So I let go and I hope you'll be happy now
You and me it was good but it wasn't right
And it'll be hard but I know I will make it out
Step by step I'll move on and get on with life
So I let go and I hope you'll be happy now

Yeah, I hope you'll be happy now
I hope you'll be happy now

Hey
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful angel
Love your imperfections, every angle
Tomorrow comes and goes before you know
So I just had to let you know

The way that Gucci look on you amazing
But nothing can compare to when you're naked
Now a Backwood and some Henny got you faded
You're saying you're the one for me, I need to face it

Started when we were younger
Swear to God that I loved her
Sorry that your mum found out
Guess that we just really had the thunder
Ain't nobody else said I'd be under
Beautiful, beautiful life right now
Beautiful, beautiful night right now
No, no, no

Hey
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful angel
Love your imperfections, every angle
Tomorrow comes and goes before you know
So I just had to let you know

The way that dress fall off you is amazing
Love a miracle, a beautiful creation
Baby, come a little closer let me taste it
You came a little closer, now you're shaking

Never ever gon' mislead you
Don't believe the lies they feed you
Stop and stare like a sculpture
Painted in your colors
Beautiful, beautiful life right now
Beautiful, beautiful night right now
Beautiful, beautiful by my side right now, yeah

Hey
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful angel
Love your imperfections, every angle
Tomorrow comes and goes before you know
So I just had to let you know

But nothing can compare to when you're naked
Tomorrow comes and goes before you know
So I just had to let you know
I just had to let you know
Swear to God you're beautiful, yeah
---------------------------------------------------
I try to keep my secrets, but I must admit
Sometimes I drink my feelings, so I can let you in
Memories bleeding, when you touch my skin
Then you're back again, oh

And I never, ever called
It's because I hated goodbyes, you know
That I never, ever called
Because I didn't wanna let you go
And if I never, ever called
It's because I hated goodbyes, you know
So I never, ever called
Cause I didn't wanna let you know
That I'm such a bad, bad liar
And you just set my bones on fire

And I just need a hand on my mouth, when you're around
Stop it from pouring out
I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad, liar

Such a bad-
Such a bad, bad, bad, bad, liar

I tried to hide my emotions
But they're runnin' free
Sometimes they're hard to notion
I feel they're drownin' me
Why am I only open
When you're about to leave?
Yeah it makes no sense, oh
And I never, ever called
It's because I hated goodbyes, you know
That I never, ever called
Because I didn't wanna let you know

That I'm such a bad, bad liar
And you just set my bones on fire
And I just need a hand on my mouth, when you're around
Stop it from pouring out
I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad, liar

Such a bad-
Such a bad, bad, bad, bad-

If I'm bein' honest, I'll just say I wanted
Yeah, fight the feelin', I'll open up to you
I'll fight the feelin', I'll open up
And if I'm bein' honest, I'mma freefallin'
Yeah, fight the feelin', I'll open up to you

Cause you know I'm such a bad, bad liar
And you just set my bones on fire
And I just need a hand on my mouth, when you're around
Stop it from pouring out
I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad, liar

Such a bad-
Such a bad, bad, bad, bad, liar

You love it how I touch you, my one
When all is said and done
You'll believe God is a woman
And I, I feel it after midnight
A feelin' that you can't fight, my one
It lingers when we're done
You'll believe God is a woman

I don't wanna waste no time, yeah
You ain't got a one-track mind, yeah
Have it any way you like, yeah
And I can tell that you know I know how I want it
Ain't nobody else can relate
Boy, I like that you ain't afraid
Baby, lay me down and let's pray
I'm tellin' you the way I like it, how I want it

(One)

---------------------------------------------------
Whoa, Joyner, Joyner, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, I done did a lot of things in my day, I admit it
I don't take back what I say, if I said it then I meant it
All my life I want a Grammy, but I'll prolly never get it
I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon (Yah I said it)
Fuck the system, I'm that nigga, bend the law, cut the rules
I'm about to risk it all, I ain't got too much to lose
Y'all been eatin' long enough, it's my turn to cut the food
Pass the plate! Where my drink? This my day, lucky you
Fuck you too, woo!

Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice

Back on my bullshit, my back to the wall
Turn my back on you, all of you finished
Back to these bullets, it's back to the job
Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin'
Back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushin'
These packs and I'm actually pumpin'
Can't fuck with you rappers, you practically suckin'
You mighta went platinum but that don't mean nothin'
I'm actually buzzin' this time
Straight out the kitchen, I told 'em the oven is mine
I do not fuck with you guys
If I don't kill you, just know you gon' suffer this time
I ain't no gangster but I got some bangers
Some chains and some blades and a couple of nines
Choppers and jammies, a partridge, a pear tree
My twelve days of Christmas was nothin' but lies
I run at you hard like a sumo (Sumo)
They say I talk like a chulo (Chulo)
I live in Mars, I'm not Bruno (Woo)
Bitch I'm a dog, call me Cujo (Rah)
You play your cards, I reverse on you all
And I might just draw 4 like a Uno (Bup)
Callate boca mejor, maricon, little puto, and all of you culo (Joyner)
They've invented a level up in the ghetto to get old
Lookin' for somethin' I prolly can never find now
Shit get relevant 'til 'nother beef die down
In truth a nigga just really want me tied down
I've been alone and I never needed nobody
Just only me and my shotty, I'll tell these niggas to lie down
Keep all the money, I never wanted the lifestyle
I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now
I said ain't no love for the other side
Or anyone who ever want smoke (Joyner)
When I die I'm goin' out as a underdog who never lost hope (Yeah)
You in the wrong cab down the wrong path
Nigga, wrong way, wrong road (Woo, woo)
Snakes in the grass tryna slither fast
I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower (Vroom!)


I done said a lotta things in my day, I admit it
This is payback in a way, I regret it that I did it
I done won a couple Grammys, but I sold my soul to get 'em
Wasn't in it for the trophies, just the fuckin' recognition
Fuck's the difference?
I'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules
Man I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose
I've been eatin' long enough, man my stomach should be full
I just ate, licked the plate, my buffet, lucky me
Fuck you think? (Woo!)

I got a couple of mansions
Still I don't have any manners
You got a couple of ghost writers
But to these kids it don't actually matter
They're askin' me, "What the fuck happened to hip-hop?"
I said, "I don't have any answers."
'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
It hurt me like hell but I'm back on these rappers
And actually comin' from humble beginnings
I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say, "What a wonderful feeling!"
"We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling!"
But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability
To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me
The inability to pen humility
Ha-ta-ta ba-ta-ta, why don't we make a bunch of
Fuckin' songs about nothin' and mumble 'em?
Fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular
Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
About the ones that were here before you that made rap
Let's recap, way back, MC's that wreak havoc on tape decks
ADAT's, where the G Raps and Kanes at?
We need 3 Stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back
'Cause half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
I don't hate trap, and I don't wanna seem mad
But in fact, where the old me at? The same cat
That would take that feedback and aim back, I need that
But I think it's inevitable
They know what button to press or what lever to pull
To get me to snap though (Lil' bitch)
And if I pay it attention I'm prob'ly makin' it bigger
But you've been takin' the dicks in the fuckin' back, ho (Get it?)
On the brink, any minute got me thinkin' of finishin'
Everything with acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits
I'm asleep at the wheel again
As I peak into thinkin' about an evil intent
Of another beat I'ma kill again
'Cause even if I gotta end up eatin' a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
It better be at least 70 to 300 milligram
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
Levels to this shit, I got an elevator
You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater
Motherfucker, now I got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA
But I wrote 'til the wheels fall off, I'm workin' tirelessly, ayy
It's the moment y'all been waitin' for
Like California wishin' rain to pour
In that drought, y'all been prayin' for
My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
Still the same Marshall, that outlaw
That they say as a writer might've fell off
I'm back on that bull like the cowboy

So y'all gotta move (yeah), y'all gotta move (yeah)

Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice

Fonsi (¡Ay!)

Eso que te falta cuando estas con el
Que te mire y que te haga sentir mujer
No te mientas que el nunca te hara el amor
Como yo, como yo (Ozuna)
Guarda tu secreto aqui en el corazon
De cuando mi boca se perdio en tu piel (wuh)
No hay que serle fiel cuando ya no hay amor, no hay amor

Es imposible que te quiera como yo (no)
No hay nadie que te quiera como yo (como yo)
Dejame que te cambie la suerte
Es imposible que te bese como yo (no)
No hay nadie que te bese como yo (como-como yo)
Para mi es imposible perderte

Y asi, na' ma', me enamore, eh-eh-eh-eh
De esa carita que no tiene nadie
Bailando aqui en el medio de la calle (ah)
Y asi (ah), na' ma' (ah), me enamoro, oh-oh-oh-oh
Quisiera que esta noche no se acabe
Es imposible que te quiera como yo (baby, como-como)

Ozuna (jaja)
Te juro, nadie va a quererte como yo lo hago
Dios mio que me perdone, pero si es pecado
Solamente quiero morir a tu lado
Y hacerte sentir to' lo que te hacia (ouh)
Jure que aquel dia, nunca olvidaria, me dijiste que volvia'
Pero yo me lo crei, sin saber que tu sabia'
Pero te volvi a tener, la vida es una ironia (oh-oh)
To' lo que te hacia
Jure que aquel dia (oh-oh-oh), nunca olvidaria, me dijiste que volvia'
Pero yo me lo crei, sin saber que tu sabia' (uoh-oh, uoh-oh)
Pero te volvi a tener, la vida es una ironia (uoh-oh-oh)

Es imposible que te quiera como yo (como yo)
No hay nadie que te quiera como yo (como yo)
Dejame que te cambie la suerte (eh-eh)
Es imposible que te bese como yo (ouh-ouh)
No hay nadie que te bese como yo (como-como yo)
Para mi es imposible perderte

De esa carita que no tiene nadie
Bailando aqui en el medio de la calle (no-no)

Te presto mis ojos para que veas lo hermosa que eres, mm, mm
Te presto mis manos para que toques las nubes si quieres
Te presto mis dedos para que recuerdes
Todo lo que hicimos esa noche del viernes
Te presto mis besos, y me los devuelves
Asi tengo una excusa para volver a verte

Yo no te pido que te enamores
Seamos eternos solo esta noche
Yo no te pido que seamos novios
Si siendo amigos ya nos damos de todo

Amigos con derecho
Y todos tus despechos
Te los quitas conmigo como nadie lo habia hecho
Amigos con derecho
Que sea nuestro secreto
Que solo las paredes sean testigos de lo nuestro

(Hey lady, escucha como nos conocimos, jaja, venga)
Eran las 8:15 en la plaza de San Juan
Ibas caminando con par de amigas mas
Te hacias la juguetona como que no quiere la cosa
Me tiraste una mirada misteriosa, yeh
Matame con esa boquita embriagame (embriagame)
Con tu cuerpo ven seduceme
Quitemonos ya la ropa que asi desnuda te ves mas sexy
Para mi tu eres mi lady
Yo soy tu Maluma, baby (jajaja)
Amigos con derecho, tu buen provecho (jaja, muah)

Te-Te-Te presto mis dedos para que recuerdes
Todo lo que hicimos esa noche del viernes
Te presto mis besos, y me los devuelves
Asi tengo una excusa para volver a verte

Yo no te pido que te enamores
Seamos eternos solo esta noche
Yo no te pido que seamos novios
Si siendo amigos ya nos damos de todo

Amigos con derecho
Y todos tus despechos
Te los quitas conmigo como nadie lo habia hecho
Amigos con derecho
Que sea nuestro secreto
Que solo las paredes sean testigos de lo nuestro

If there was a picture perfect, it would be us
I could be across the world and I would still have your trust
Don't even got to question if I'm the one giving up
But you keep saying you've had enough

So tell me where to go 'cause I have nowhere to hide
I just want you by my side
But do I still have your heart? Do I still cross your mind?
Have we grown apart, should we even try?

I still keep your picture frame on the side of my bed
Acting like I'm good but I can no longer pretend
Keeping myself busy, tryna find something to do
But everytime I try, somehow it brings me back to you

So what do I do?
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know

See I used to call you probably 10 times a day
But now we on the phone but we got nothing to say
And every time I hear our song, it don't sound the same
I don't know if I could do another day

So tell me where to go 'cause I have nowhere to hide
I just want you by my side
But do I still have your heart?
Do I still cross your mind?
Have we grown apart, should we even try?

I still keep your picture frame on the side of my bed
Acting like I'm good but I can no longer pretend
Keeping myself busy, tryna find something to do
But every time I try, somehow it brings me back to you

I know things happen for a reason
But I'm tired of this pain I'm feeling
I don't know if I'm strong enough for these changes
'Cause baby I still keep your

I still keep your picture frame on the side of my bed (far side of my bed)
Acting like I'm good but I can no longer pretend (girl, you know I'll still take care for you)
Keeping myself busy, tryna find something to do (keeping myself busy)
But every time I try, (and every time) somehow it brings me back to you (see, every time it brings me to you)

I still keep your picture frame on the side of my bed
Acting like I'm good but I can no longer pretend
Keeping myself busy, tryna find something to do
But every time I try, somehow it brings me back to you
---------------------------------------------------
Even though we both know we're liars and we start each other's fires
We just know that we'll be alright
Even though we're kicked out the party 'cause we both hate everybody
We're the ones they wanna be like

So don't let me down
Keep me in trouble
Born to be wild
Out in the jungle

And I don't wanna be somebody without your body
Close to me
And if it wasn't you, I wouldn't want anybody
Close to me
'Cause I'm an animal, animal-al
Like animal, like you
And I don't wanna be somebody without your body
Close to me


You can never come too close for comfort
I had to cut my bitch off, she bein' stubborn (Stubborn)
I make it known I fuck with you, not undercover ('Cover)
And when I jump in, I'm burnin' rubber (Yeah, skrrt)
Iced out body, didn't go to college (Yeah, yeah)
Price tag poppin', then you on the private (Then you on a)
Don't say "Sorry," everyone's watchin' (Everyone)
When you're where I am, everything's timeless (Yeah, yeah)


And I don't wanna be somebody without your body
Close to me
And if it wasn't you, I wouldn't want anybody
Close to me
'Cause I'm an animal, animal-al
Like animal, like you
And I don't wanna be somebody without your body
Close to me
Close to me
Close to me
Yeah

Animal, animal-al
Like animal, like you

And I don't wanna be somebody without your body
Close to me
And if it wasn't you, I wouldn't want anybody
Close to me
Because I'm an animal, animal-al
Like animal, like you
And I don't wanna be somebody without your body
Close to me
Close to me
(To me)
Close to me

I know you see me just sittin' here drinkin'
And thinkin' about callin' her up
Just give me time to come to my sense
And commencing to just getting drunk
'Cause I just need a moment alone to think it over
I promise, baby, I'll forget
How she done me wrong for so long
But, girl, don't come over yet

And just leave, leave me alone
Why can't you see that I can't move on?
'Cause I see her face in yours
And I hear her voice any time you talk
Her lips on the glass of the drink you're drinking
And her hips in the way you walk
So leave me alone

Well, I know our eyes have met from afar in this bar before
Either up in line and buy her a drink
Or out there on the dance floor
But I can't believe tonight of all nights
You chose to come and talk to me
And I ain't heard a word you've been saying
I'm talking to a memory
That I wish would

Leave, leave me alone
Why can't you see that I can't move on?
'Cause I see her face in yours
And I hear her voice any time you talk
Her lips on the glass of the drink you're drinking
And her hips in the way you walk
So leave me alone, oh

And just leave, leave me alone
Why can't you see that I can't move on?
'Cause I see her face in yours
And I hear her voice any time you talk
Why don't you leave, leave me alone
And why can't you see that I can't move on?
And I see her face in yours
And I hear her voice any time you talk
Her lips on the glass of the drink you're drinking
Her hips in the way you walk
So leave me alone

One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need

Let me take the night, I love real easy
And I know that you'll still wanna see me
On the Sunday morning, music real loud
Let me love you while the moon is still out

Something in you
Lit up heaven in me
The feeling won't let me sleep
'Cause I'm lost in the way you move, the way you feel

One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need

One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me

Feel your eyes do the exploring
Passion in the message when you smile

'Cause I'm lost in the way you move, the way you feel

One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me

Will you hold the line
When every one of them has given up and given in, tell me
In this house of mine
Nothing ever comes without a consequence or cost, tell me
Will the stars align?
Will heaven step in? Will it save us from our sin? Will it?
'Cause this house of mine stands strong

That's the price you pay
Leave behind your heart and cast away
Just another product of today
Rather be the hunter than the prey
And you're standing on the edge, face up 'cause you're a...

Natural
A beating heart of stone
You gotta be so cold
To make it in this world
Yeah, you're a natural
Living your life cutthroat
You gotta be so cold
Yeah, you're a natural

Will somebody
Let me see the light within the dark trees shadowing
What's happening?
Looking through the glass find the wrong within the past knowing
Oh, we are the youth
Cut until it bleeds inside a world, without the peace, face it
A bit of the truth, the truth

That's the price you pay
Leave behind your heart and cast away
Just another product of today
Rather be the hunter than the prey
And you're standing on the edge, face up 'cause you're a...

Natural
A beating heart of stone
You gotta be so cold
To make it in this world
Yeah, you're a natural
Living your life cutthroat
You gotta be so cold
Yeah, you're a natural

Deep inside me, I'm fading to black, I'm fading
Took an oath by the blood of my hand, won't break it
I can taste it, the end is upon us, I swear
Gonna make it
I'm gonna make it

Natural
A beating heart of stone
You gotta be so cold
To make it in this world
Yeah, you're a natural
Living your life cutthroat
You gotta be so cold
Yeah, you're a natural

Natural
Yeah, you're a natural

Home grown alligator, see you later
Gotta hit the road, gotta hit the road
Something changed in the atmosphere, architecture unfamiliar
I could get used to this

Time flies by in the yellow and green
Stick around and you'll see what I mean
There's a mountain top that I'm dreaming of
If you need me, you know where I'll be

I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like a someone
I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like a someone

Well, South of the Equator, navigator
Gotta hit the road, gotta hit the road
And deep sea diving round the clock
Bikini bottoms, lager tops
I could get used to this

Time flies by in the yellow and green
Stick around and you'll see what I mean
There's a mountain top that I'm dreaming of
If you need me, you know where I'll be

I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like a someone
I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like a someone

We got two in the front, two in the back
Sailing along and we don't look back
(Back, back, back-back-back, back-back-back)

Time flies by in the yellow and green
Stick around and you'll see what I mean
There's a mountain top that I'm dreaming of
If you need me, you know where I'll be

I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like a someone
I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like a someone

I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun

The world on drugs
Ten (Yeah) thousand-dollar plates
Thousand-dollar plates
{Thousand-dollar plates, fine china}
{Shorty like a, uh}
Shorty like a
(Wheezy outta here)


Shorty like a thousand-dollar plate, fine china
Tell her that she beautiful every day, I remind her
Then I jump in her pussy like a lake, I'm a diver
And her last man was a pussy, had a vagina
I get lost in her eyes, like dust from the skies
It's her body or nobody, I refuse to compromise
So if she leaves, I'ma kill her, oh, she'll die
Did I say that out loud? I'm so crazy about mine

Goin' insane, feel you pickin' up and movin' things inside my brain
I know I don't have to argue about everything
But we don't have the same soul
Would've sold yours too and got a bigger bankroll
You tell me that you love me, baby, say it again
Repeat it over and over until it's in my brain
Picked up the drugs so I let my brain go
Would've fried yours too, but I'm selfish about my Percs, oh

Shorty like a thousand-dollar plate, fine china
Tell her that she beautiful every day, I remind her
Then I jump in her pussy like a lake, I'm a diver
And her last man was a pussy, had a vagina
I get lost in her eyes, like dust from the skies
It's her body or nobody, I refuse to compromise
So if she leaves, I'ma kill her, oh, she'll die
Did I say that out loud? I'm so crazy about mine


I'm so crazy about mine (Wheezy outta here)
I'm goin' to Pluto with my girl (Oh, shorty)
I'm goin' to Jupiter with my girl (Don't call your exes)
I'm goin' to Mars with my girl (Don't call your exes)
I'm goin' to Saturn with my girl
Been feelin' like I'm runnin' out of space
You need to send your location, I can't think
I done fell in love twice but I gotta be lyin'
'Cause I'm livin' ten lives, I go crazy about mines, ay


Shorty like a thousand-dollar plate, fine china
Tell her that she beautiful every day, I remind her
Then I jump in her pussy like a lake, I'm a diver
And her last man was a pussy, had a vagina
I get lost in her eyes, like dust from the skies

Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up...
Ayy, yeah
Tay Keith, this too hard
Ring, ring, ring, we drip too hard, ayy
(Run that back, Turbo)
Yeah, ayy, look


I bring up money, they change up the topic
I got a 19 and it fold in my pocket
She gave me her number, now I gotta block it
I'm mixin' the dirty bills in with the profit
Clean that shit up and I give it right back to him
If I don't fuck with him, then I can't rap with him
I wanna be there when somebody catches him
I want a witness to see that shit
(Man, these folks, these folks gotta goddamn hear this shit, no cap)
I bring up hits and they change up the topic
I got a 19 and it fold in my pocket
One hell of a year and a nigga still droppin'
They wanted to stop it, but they couldn't stop it
You told a story like shorty was feelin' you
She told a story like she split the bill with you
Look at my story, man, no one could write it
Now I see a million, I don't get excited
I might just YSL my shit, the Thugger way
Ain't no real sense in me goin' the other way
Cannot be seen in that shit from the other day
Virgil just chef'd me a whole different colorway
Please don't be stupid, it's Baby and Gunna
And Baby, he wanted her, so I just swung her
Next time I'm in Dallas, I'll look for another
You niggas fell off and you never recovered


Poured up some Hi-Tech and wait 'til it bubble
Young Gunna Gunna, I make this shit double
Hit Eliantte and left with a puddle
It's me, Drake, and Baby, you know you in trouble
Run up my check, my bitch sprinted the shuttle
Sign plus an M, bought a Benz for my brother
Painted all black, the interior butter
I drip like a leak and that's word to my mother
Yeah, came out the street, gotta sleep with a cutter
Found me a bitch who gon' eat, it's a supper
My dick in her mouth like she teethin' or somethin'
Sound like it could be Drip Season this summer
Ain't no comparin' 'cause we number one
In black and white Chanel, I look like a nun
The police in shock, don't know who got a gun
Don't got what I got 'cause I shop in Milan
It's winter, I still took the top off the don
The kid was surprised that my trunk in the front
I know you a upset they don't shine in the sun
Cuban link look like a box of crayons
I'm still at the lot, tryna cop the Cayenne
I told the judge, "Fuck it", I'm goin' on the run
You want it, my dawgs'll look out for the bond


And I'm gettin' by, let 'em choose sides
We get M's in by the shoe size
I don't fuck with y'all type of kind
I done seen all y'all dickride
Bread winner like I'm Kevin Gates
And I swear to God, I don't get tired
From the trenches, now I'm goin'
Spend a whole hundred on a new wristwatch

Don't gotta drip, I can leave it to Gunna
Runnin' this shit, only been out two summers
That 4x4 truck, I post 300
Boy, at whoever, they know how I'm comin'
Ain't got no feelings, I'm here for the money
Treat every club like a Magic on Monday
Niggas ain't rich for real, they gettin' fronted
Gave her a dime, told her fix up her stomach
By the time she get back, I'ma switch up my number
Cap to her friend like I been on her bumper
Lately, I been the topic of discussion
Draco was foreign, they shoot it from Russia
Bad vibes at my show like I'm Usher
If she tell me "No" once, I won't even touch it
All I do is get her out here, abortion
Act like I've been rich, I used to have nothin'
Drizzy hit me up like he got another one
Money ain't even came in from the other one
Fuck it, I'm hot, so I might as well double up
Seem like everything I get on a numba one
They tryna team up to beat me, they huddlin' up
Ever catch me out in traffic, I'm cuttin' up
Every city we go to, it be lit as fuck
Tryna put the police on us, get rid of us

And I'm gettin' by, let 'em choose sides
We get M's in by the shoe size
I don't fuck with y'all type of kind
I done seen all y'all dickride
Bread winner like I'm Kevin Gates

From the trenches, now I'm goin'

You say love is messed up
You say that it don't work
You don't wanna try, no, no
(You don't wanna try, no, no)
And baby, I'm no stranger
To heartbreak and the pain of
Always being let go (Always being let go)

And I know there's no making this right, this right (This right)
And I know there's no changing your mind, your mind (Your mind)
But we both found each other tonight, tonight (Oh yeah)
So if love is nothing more than just a waste of your time

Waste it on me, waste it on me
(Waste it on me)
Tell me, why not waste it on me? Waste it on me
(Waste it on me)
Baby, why not waste it on me? Waste it on me
(Waste it on me)
Tell me, why not waste it on me? Waste it on me
(Waste it on me)

So we don't gotta go there
Past lovers and warfare
It's just you and me now (Yeah, yeah)
I don't know your secrets
But I'll pick up the pieces
Pull you close to me now (Yeah, yeah)

And I know there's no making this right, this right (Yeah)
And I know there's no changing your mind, your mind (Oh)
But we both found each other tonight, tonight (Oh yeah)
So if love is nothing more than just a waste of your time

Waste it on me, waste it on me
(Waste it on me)
Tell me, why not waste it on me? Waste it on me
(Waste it on me)
Baby, why not waste it on me? Waste it on me
(Waste it on me)
Tell me, why not waste it on me? Waste it on me
(Waste it on me)
Tell me, why not?

Yay, don't you think there must be a reason
Yeah, like we had our names
Don't you think we got another season
That come after spring
I wanna be your summer
I wanna be your wave
Treat me like a comma
And I'll take you to a new phrase
Yeah, come just eat me and throw me away
If I'm not your taste, babe, waste
Waste it on me

And I know there's no making this right, this right (Yeah)
And I know there's no changing your mind, your mind (Oh)
But we both found each other tonight, tonight (Oh, yeah)
So if love is nothing more than just a waste of your time

Waste it on me, waste it on me
(Waste it on me)
Tell me, why not waste it on me? Waste it on me
(Waste it on me)
Baby, why not waste it on me? Waste it on me
(Waste it on me)
Tell me, why not waste it on me? Waste it on me
(Waste it on me)
Tell me, why not?

Hace rato no la ven, pero hoy salio a beber
Porque ya no tiene novio
Ella sabe como soy, si me llama, yo le doy
Porque yo no tengo novia (y ahora anda solita)
Hace rato no la ven, pero hoy salio a beber
Porque ya no tiene novio (y ahora es mia solita)
Ella sabe como soy, si me llama, yo le doy
Porque yo no tengo novia (y ahora es mia solita)

La ultima vez que la vi
Ella andaba con un tipo por ahi
Que cosa rara, ahora esta encima de mi
¿Que esta pasando?, ¿que esta pasando?
Yo no lo se, se
Pero parece que ella se quiere vengar de el, el

Si tu novio te termina, yo te tengo la mejor medicina
Si tu novio te termina, mezcla guaro con tequila (ay)

Hace rato no la ven, pero hoy salio a beber
Porque ya no tiene novio (porque ya no tiene novio)
Ella sabe como soy, si me llama, yo le doy

Ay, ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay, ay (yeah)
Ay, ay, ay, ay
Que yo tengo lo que el novio no tenia

Tan solo en unos minutos se me monta encima
Ella quiere que esta noche la haga mia
Que la agarre y que la lleve pa' la esquina
Y se que tengo lo que Yatra no tenia
Se pego, se pego, nadie me la quito
Se pego, se pego, creo que se enamoro
Se pego, se pego, nunca se despego
Se pego, se pego

Si tu novio (si tu novio) te termina (te termina)
Yo te tengo la mejor medicina
Si tu novio (si tu novio) te termina (te termina)
Mezcla guaro con tequila

Que yo tengo lo que el novio no tenia

Con su voz asesina me dice
"Yatra, vamos, que mi casa esta vacia"
Esto no se termina
Empezamos en la sala y terminamo' en la piscina

Si tu novio (si tu novio), te termina (te termina)
Yo te tengo la mejor medicina
Si tu novio (si tu novio) te termina (te termina)
Mezcla guaro con tequila

Uah
(KOB, Real Hasta La Muerte, baby)


Cuando una mujer decide ser mala y no quiere dueno
Probablemente un hombre la engano en su vida, sin sentimientos
Rumba, el pasado lo enterro en la tumba
La mala tiene vida, la buena es la difunta
Ahora, pal' carajo la envidia de todas
Todo bobolon que se le acerque ella lo ignora
Tan callai'ta que era la nena
Ahora es candela
La veo cazando con veinte botellas
Presiento un problema
Yo soy servicial con sus deseos
Si me pide como R Kelly yo la- (Nasty)
No me gustan chamaquitas
Solo hago lo que la bebe le excita
El le fallo-o-o y la traiciono-o-o
Ahora ella va a vengarse en mi cama


Ella quiere beber, ella quiere bailar
Su novio la dejo y lo quiere olvidar
Ella se entrego y el tipo le fallo
Y por eso se va a rumbear (Rumbear)
Ella quiere beber, ella quiere bailar
Su novio la dejo y lo quiere olvidar
Ella se entrego y el tipo le fallo
Y por eso se va a rumbear

En el Phantom yo te voy a buscar
Baby, tu nunca me va' a olvidar (Bebe)
Yo necesito que me ensene' a amar (Amar)
Bebecita, yo te vo' a devorar
Bebecita, tu cuerpo y tu a mi me excitan (uah)
Por dentro tu me necesita'
Tu siempre va' a ser mi diablita
Mi loquita, mojaita'

Tu cuerpo y tu a mi me excitan
Por dentro tu me necesita'
Tu siempre va' a ser mi diablita
Mi loquita, bien bonita


Ella quiere beber, ella quiere bailar
Su novio la dejo y lo quiere olvidar
Ella se entrego y el tipo le fallo
Y por eso se va a rumbear
Ella quiere beber, ella quiere bailar
Su novio la dejo y lo quiere olvidar
Ella se entrego y el tipo le fallo
Y por eso se va a rumbear


Ella me miraba desde lejo'
Bailando en un hilito de Romeo (uah)
Nunca escuchaba lo' consejo'
En sus ojos siempre veo mis reflejos
Le fallo-o-o y la traiciono-o-o
Ella se emborracho-o y conmigo se escapo-o-o
Veinte botella', champana rosada
La bebecita me deseaba (uah)
Una diablita, ella me devoraba (uah)
Y yo adentro 'e su piel
Me enterraba (uah)
Dios mio, que rico, baby (baby)
Su cuerpo se apodera de mi (de mi)
Temblando en un orgasmo pa' mi (pa' mi)
Real Hasta La Muerte, baby

Ella quiere beber, ella quiere bailar (Bailar)
Su novio la dejo y lo quiere olvidar
Ella se entrego y el tipo le fallo
Y por eso se va a rumbear


Ella quiere beber, ella quiere bailar
Su novio la dejo y lo quiere olvidar
Ella se entrego y el tipo le fallo

Solo, solito en la habitacion
Busca, que busca de mi calor, uoh-oh, no-no
Quiere' remedio pa' tu dolor
Nadie te lo hace mejor que yo, uoh-oh, (no-no)


Que no se te apague la excitacion
Tu sabes que yo no te dejo planta'o

Calma'o, que yo voy en camino, amor
Calma'o, que yo quiero contigo


Si tu me llama'
Nos vamo' pa' tu casa
Nos quedamo' en la cama
Sin pijama, sin pijama


Si tu me llamas

Mostrando todo, todito
Cuando llegue desbaratamo' la cama

Baby, hoy no vamo' a dormir (no)

Si no hay teatro deja el drama
Enciendeme la llama
Como yo vine al mundo, ese es mi mejor pijama
Hoy hay toque de queda
Sere tuya hasta la manana
La pasamos romantic
Sin piloto automatic
Botamos el manual, 'tamos viajando en cannabis
Siempre he sido una dama (una gyal)
Pero soy una perra en la cama

Asi que dale pom-pom-pom-pom-pom
Ponle carne a mi sazon-zon-zon-zon-zon
Choca to' eso con mi bon-bon-bon-bon-bon
Perdemo' el control pa' ganar los do'


Asi que dale pom-pom-pom-pom-pom

Choca to' eso con mi bon-bon-bon-bon-bon
Espero tu call, vente dame el gol


Si tu me llama'
Nos vamo' pa' tu casa
Nos quedamo' en la cama
Sin pijama, sin pijama


Si tu me llamas
Nos vamo' pa' tu casa
Fumamo' marihuana
Sin pijama, sin pijama

Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos
My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Don't act like you my friend when I'm rollin' through my ends, though

You stuck in the friend zone, I tell that four-five the fifth, ayy
Hunnid bands inside my shorts, DeChino the shit, ayy
Try to stuff it all in, but it don't even fit, ayy
Know that I been with the shits ever since a jit, ayy
I made my first million, I'm like, "Shit, this is it," ayy
30 for a walk through, man, we had that bitch lit, ayy
Had so many bottles, gave ugly girl a sip
Out the window of the Benzo, we get seen in the rent'
And I'm like "Whoa, man, my neck so goddamn cold"
Diamonds wet, my t-shirt soaked
I got homies, let it go, oh
My money thick, won't ever fold
She said, "Can I have some to hold?"
And I can't ever tell you no

Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos
My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Don't act like you my friend when I'm rollin' through my ends, though


The AP goin' psycho, my Rollie goin' brazy
I'm hittin' lil' mama, she wanna have my babies
It's fifty on the pinky, chain so stanky
You should see the whip, promise I can take yo' bitch
Dolla ridin' in an old school Chevy, it's a drop top
Boolin' with a thot-thot, she gon' give me top-top
Just one switch, I can make the ass drop (hey)
Uh, take you to the smoke shop
We gon' get high, ayy, we gon' hit Rodeo
Dial up Valentino, we gon' hit Pico
Take you where I'm from, take you to the slums
This ain't happen overnight, no, these diamonds real bright
Saint Laurent jeans, still in my Vans though
All VVSs, put you in a necklace
Girl, you look beautiful tonight
Stars on the roof, they matching with the jewelry


Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos
My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you

Light done struck me, see I'm feelin' lucky like I know she'll fuck me
Life's a fickle bitch and there's no tellin' if she loves me
Sometimes she smiles on me, I could see her light shinin'
But when the light is gone, it's dark, it's cold before the diamonds
Life's about timin' it, and time, it waits for nobody
It's like a fuckin' drug controllin' your mind and your whole body
Burnin' from your soul, yearnin' for more in this, how come he
Livin' the life of royalty? I take what I want, naturally
You're the casualty as we casually take you tragically
Magically make you disappear, randomly cause calamity

Sittin' in the Cali sun, heat it up
Sittin' in the Cali sun, heat it up
I keep fallin' down, I keep fallin' down
I keep fallin' down (stay down)
I keep fallin' down, I keep fallin' down
I keep fallin' down (stay down)

This is the insanity, get this dose of anarchy
Soak in all of the vanity, devoid of all humanity, examine me
Break apart your family, randomly
'Cause what ahead of me? This is a rhapsody, a tragedy
Examine me, take a close look like a man, throwin' the ghost hook
Got you fuckin' shook, and now I close the book
As I'm walkin' through the park, got you scared of the dark
Frightened by the shadows, I'm the one that is behind

Sittin' in the Cali sun, heat it up
Sittin' in the Cali sun, heat it up
I keep fallin' down, I keep fallin' down
I keep fallin' down (stay down)
I keep fallin' down, I keep fallin' down
I keep fallin' down (stay down)

Aura
No va a ser tan facil
Aunque me esquives como quiera
Tras de ti, voy tras de ti (yeh)
Tu tienes todo lo que quiero para mi


Y tu tan sola por ahi
Detras de ti voy a seguir
Yo se que lo bueno toma tiempo, lady


Es que me gustas tu na' ma'
No me importan las demas
Una vaina loca que me da
Que por mas que intento no se va


Me gustas tu na' ma'
No importan las demas
Una vaina loca que me da
Que por mas que intento no se va


Me gustas tu na' ma', no se disimular
La musica que hago solo en ti me hace pensar
Unica, una rosa yo me la quiero robar
Sencilla, bonita, no se tiene que maquillar
Me mata el piquete
Baila duro y le mete
Con nadie se compromete
Y menos si tu le promete
Tiene lo que quiero
Me tira que yo le llego
No se disimular, bailo contigo y yo me entrego
Me mata el piquete
Baila duro y le mete
Con nadie se compromete
Y menos si tu le promete
Tiene lo que quiero
Me tira que yo le llego
No se disimular, bailo contigo y yo me entrego


Es que me gustas tu na' ma'
No me importan las demas
Una vaina loca que me da
Que por mas que intento no se va


Es que me gustas tu na' ma'
No me importan las demas
Una vaina loca que me da
Que por mas que intento no se va


Porque cuando te tengo cerquita
Me entra una vaina loca que despues no se me quita
Es que en mi lista tu eres la favorita
Tu eres la unica que este hombre necesita
Baby tu eres lo que yo quiero
Vale mas que el dinero
Yo viajo el mundo entero
Si es por ti no hay pero
Siento que por ti desespero
Cuando no te tengo mas


Es que me gustas tu na' ma'
No me importan las demas
Una vaina loca que me da
Que por mas que intento no se va


Me gustas tu na' ma'
No me importan las demas
Una vaina loca que me da
Que por mas que intento no se va

Dit is Slowflow met een kleine stackie
Ik loop in een techie maar ik stijl 'm dood (ai)
Deze bitches willen mij in principe
Allemaal wiepen of lijkt het zo? (ai ai ai)
M'n IKEA dekbed type of ho's
Filter Snapchat type of ho's (ai)
Koop een goeie bak na deze vijftien shows (ai)
Ik ben gewoon gefocust daarom lijk ik boos (ai ai ai ai)
Droom niet meer ik heb wensen (ja)
Zat net nog voor 6000 mensen
Moest overgeven voor ik opkwam
Dat is een kleine confession
Maar ewa ja da's gezonde spanning
Heb die show gerockt ben never lacking (ai ai ai ai)
Ben met baas man Chievva draait de plaatjes
Ik heb y'tje naast me op de backing
Ik doe soms dom op een volle Henny
Ren voor ons ons als een honderd grammy
Adrenaline stroomt nog door m'n body
Bleef niet hangen daar ik ben weer op de snellie (ai ai ai ai)
Dus ik cash en verdwijn als een echte boss (ai ai ai)
Ben aan 't winnen ik ga niet meer loss
Konden snel nog een snap schieten maar ik neem geen soetoe's van je slechte as

'T Is mij niet meer ontglipt, nee
Ik heb omin money koud gemaakt toen maar ik heb nieuwe money in de maak neef

Ik heb m'n ogen op een ton liggen, ey
Money motivatie elke dag van een skere jongen naar een volle zak
Ben nog steeds met dealers in de fucking nacht (woosh)
Pull up bij me show moet meteen eraf (skrr)
To the next one, via achterkant
'K ga naar buiten of binnen
Blacka money maar ik kan nu ook pinnen
Was met je wifey en haar gekke vriendinnen (woosh)
Gekke nachten met de gang net een film
Pull up in een Benz of pull up in de Aygo (skrr)
Gewoon van de porrent ik ben een piraat (wah)
Mattie wat denk je ik kom van de straat
Denk aan mijn saaf
Spend niet om bitches ik spend op m'n ma en ik spend op m'n pa
Halve tatta ik ben op m'n kaas (kaas)
Nieuwe witte money is in de maak (ja)
Ga voor die Range of voor die CLA (skrr)
Rond de zomer is de keuze gemaakt, ah

Perdoname,
no se lo que paso contigo que no te veo como antes,
tus manos ya me daban frio
no tenia como calentarme.
Lo siento por apenas contarte,
no queria lastimarte.

Confieso que
en medio de tu descuido
he conocido mucha gente,
sabes que yo no soy de amigos
pero tu estabas tan ausente, tan distante,
las cosas cambian bastante,
has dejado de importarme.

Yo se como paso,
esa distancia que teniamos,
lentamente estaba matandonos.
Si hay un culpable aqui somos los dos,
pero ella no.

Tu nunca tenias tiempo
pa' nuestros encuentros,
la relacion iba tan lento
y tu siempre tenias un cuento.
Yo me perdia en el intento
de recuperar este sentimiento, pero
nunca pude, no me detuve
le pedi a mi Dios pa' que me ayude.
Tu con tus malas actitudes,
y otra me hacia solicitudes, y no.
Ella hizo lo que no hiciste,
no la culpes a ella mas,
si por tu culpa fue que me perdiste.

Yo se como paso,
esa distancia que teniamos,
lentamente estaba matandonos.
Si hay un culpable aqui somos los dos,
pero ella no.

A nadie quiero culpar,
no estoy en condicion de reclamar,
acepto que tambien he sido complice,
no soy el mismo que cuando te conquiste.
Lo que te voy a contar,
seguramente te va a hacer llorar,
alguien se dio cuenta de lo que pasaba,
se aprovecho cuando no estabas.

Perdoname,
no se lo que paso contigo que no te veo como antes,
tus manos ya me daban frio
no tenia como calentarme.
Lo siento por apenas contarte,
no queria lastimarte.

Yo se como paso,
esa distancia que teniamos,
lentamente estaba matandonos.
Si hay un culpable aqui somos los dos,
pero ella no.

Yo se como paso,

Yeah

Wheezy out of here


The dash, it's digital, the schedule busy
My head in a hoodie, my shorty a goodie
My cousins are crazy, my cousins like Boogie
Life is amazin', it is what it should be
Been here for ten but I feel like a rookie
I tell her, "look up" 'cause it's snowin' in Tootsie's
Booked for three years, man you can't even book me
It's me and Lil Baby, this shit goin' crazy
Wheezy produced it and Weezy F. made me
And she held it down, so she got a Mercedes
Young Money Records, the Army, the Navy
They ran me ten thousand, I threw it like Brady
The foreign is yellow like Tracee and K.D
I trusted my niggas, they never betrayed me
Met all these niggas, they sweeter than Sadie
When I started out, I just took what they gave me
Did all the favors, they never repaid me
It worked in my favor, 'cause nobody saved me


Brand new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like yes indeed

Cartier glasses, I won't even peek at you
Yellow Ferrari like Pikachu
I got 'em waitin' and watchin' what he gon' do
Tryna peep what I do, tryna steal my moves
25 hundred for a new pair of tennis shoes
The same price, I could make them youngins come and finish you
Lawyer been chargin', he a Jewish like he voodoo
Real dope boy, hundred thousand in Evisu
Presidential tints slide by, we don't see you
I been gettin' money, I ain't worried 'bout what he do
I'm gettin' money like I'm from the '80s
Me and Drake 'bout to drop man, this shit gon' go crazy
They know I'm the truth, comin' straight from the basement
I'm straight as the street, man I come from the pavement
A million, all hundreds, it make em 'go crazy
Wah-wah-wah, bitch, I'm the Baby

Brand new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like yes indeed
Me and my dawg goin' all the way
When you livin' like this, they supposed to hate
Brand new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like yes indeed
Me and my dawg goin' all the way
When you livin' like this, they supposed to hate


Wheezy out of here
---------------------------------------------------
They're rotting my brain, love
These hoes are the same

I admit it, another hoe got me finished
Broke my heart, oh no you didn't
Fuck sippin', I'mma down a whole bottle
Hard liquor, hard truth can't swallow
Need a bartender, put me out my sorrow
Wake up the next day in the Monte Carlo
With a new woman
Tell me she from Colorado
And she love women
She'll be gone by tomorrow
Who am I kiddin'
All this jealousy and agony that I sit in
I'm a jealous boy, really feel like John Lennon
I just want real love, guess it's been a minute
Pissed off from the way that I don't fit in, I don't fit in
Tell me what's the secret to love, I don't get it
Feel like I be runnin' a race I'm not winnin'
Ran into the devil today and she grinnin'

Hey, these girls are insane
All girls are the same
They're rotting my brain, love
Think I need a change
Before I go insane, love
All girls are the same
They're rotting my brain, love
Think I need a change
Before I go insane, love

Ten minutes, she told me it would take ten minutes
To break my heart, oh no she didn't
Fuck living, Imma drown in my sorrow
Fuck giving, Imma take not borrow
And I'm still sinnin'
I'm still losing my mind
I know I been trippin'
I'm still wasting my time
All the time given, am I dying, am I living
It's fuck feelin's, my sorrow go up to the ceilin'

Now I am insane
Demons in my brain, love
Peace I can't obtain
Cause all these girls the same, love
Now I am insane
Demons in my brain, love
Peace I can't obtain
Cause all these girls the same, love

Wake up and smell the coffee
Is your cup half full or empty?
When we talk, you say it softly
But I love it when you're awfully quiet, quiet

You see the piece of paper
Could be a little greater
Show me what you could make her
You'll never know until you try it
And you don't have to keep it quiet

And I know it makes you nervous
But I promise you, it's worth it
To show 'em everything you kept inside
Don't hide, don't hide
Too shy to say, but I hope you stay
Don't hide away
Come out and play

Look up, out of your window
See snow, won't let it in though
Leave home, feel the wind blow
'Cause it's colder here inside in silence
And you don't have to keep it quiet

Yeah, I know it makes you nervous
But I promise you, it's worth it
To show 'em everything you kept inside
Don't hide, don't hide
Too shy to say but I hope you stay
Don't hide away
Come out and play

Remember
All the good times lately
How could you forget?
Do your hair
For about five hours
No it does not really look that different

Yes I drove way out
Oh how could you forget?
Screaming at the traffic
I'm feeling lovesick
At the baja fresh
What the hell did I expect?
How could you forget?

Now you act
Like I'm acting funny
I can't help myself
'Cause my love
Is dangerous
No I cannot simply go and turn it off

Yes I drove way out
Oh how could you forget?
Screaming at the traffic
I'm feeling lovesick
At the baja fresh
What the hell did I expect?
How could you forget?

Catch your eyes
Flashing in the mirror
Like two midnight pools
Can't believe
I was a believer
No I will not count on you anymore

Yes I drove way out
Oh how could you forget?
Screaming at the traffic
I'm feeling lovesick
At the baja fresh
What the fuck did I expect?
How could you forget?
---------------------------------------------------
You touch me and it's almost like we knew
That there will be history between us two
We knew someday that we would have regrets
But we just ignored them the night we met
We just dance backwards into each other
Trying to keep our feelings secretly covered
You touch me and it's almost like we knew
That there will be history

There's no way that it's not going there
With the way that were looking at each other
There's no way that it's not going there
Every second with you I want another
But maybe we can hold off one sec
So we can keep this tension in check
But there's no way that it's not going there
With the way that were looking at each other

I wish I could make the time stop
So we could forget everything and everyone
I wish that the time would line up
So we could just give in to what we want
'Cause when I got somebody, you don't
And when you got somebody, I don't
I wish that the time would line up
So we could just give in

There's no way that it's not going there
With the way that were looking at each other
There's no way that it's not going there
Every second with you I want another
But maybe we can hold off one sec
So we can keep this tension in check
But there's no way that it's not going there
With the way that were looking at each other

We just dance backwards into each other
Trying to keep our feelings secretly covered
We just dance backwards into each other
Trying to keep our feelings secretly covered
You touched me and it's almost like we knew
That there would be history

There's no way that it's not going there
With the way that were looking at each other
There's no way that it's not going there
Every second with you I want another
But maybe we can hold off one sec
So we can keep this tension in check
But there's no way that it's not going there
With the way that were looking at each other

We just keep on dancing right into each other
We just keep on dancing right into each other
---------------------------------------------------
Call me up and break it off
Now know that I am not enough
Wish that I could have been better
Like I said in all my letters

Keep me in the space between
What you love and what you need
Wish that I could go and get her
Now I stand in awful weather
(Now I stand in awful weather)

All that I ever wanted
I wanna feel worth it
Don't want to be worthless
I wish that I could be
All the people out of there
The friends that desert them
I wanna be perfect
I wish that I could be
Better, better

Know that I have hit the ground
A tiny space to crawl around
Wish that I could find myself
Am I a lost cause, honey?

So tell me how to be
Tell me what you need
Tell me everything that I have fucked up, I wanna see
It's not a place but a person that's home
And I wanna be loved
I don't wanna be lonely
(And I wanna be loved
I don't wanna be lonely)

All that I ever wanted
I wanna feel worth it
Don't want to be worthless
I wish that I could be
All the people out of there
The friends that desert them
I wanna be perfect
I wish that I could be
(Better)

Holding my breath for somebody else and
If I get past the way, the way that I have been
Would you be proud of me?

Wish that I could have been better
Like I said in all my letters
(Like I said in all my letters)

All that I ever wanted
I wanna feel worth it
Don't want to be worthless
I wish that I could be
All the people out of there
The friends that desert them
I wanna be perfect
I wish that I could be
Better, better
I wish that I could be
Better, better

Yo se que tu amor es puro peligro
Yo se, ahora cuando duermo tengo delirio
Porque-

No se me olvida esa noche en Ibiza
En el muelle con la brisa
Flamenco y tu sonrisa
No se me olvida esa noche en Ibiza
Un beso el alma me friza
Deten el tiempo, no hay prisa bebe


Dime bebesita como mato esta tentacion
De volver a tu puerto y hacerte el amor
Porque amiguita tu me tienes
Como Alejandro Sanz
Cuando nadie me ve
Pongo el mundo al reves
Y esta melancolia
Me tiene en musa de noche y de dia
Tengo un cuaderno con cien mil canciones
Cincuenta poemas y tu no eres mia
Y solo por un beso
Yo mismo me someto a preso
Y luego botare la llave
En el oceano tan inmenso


No se me olvida esa noche en Ibiza
En el muelle con la brisa
Flamenco y tu sonrisa

No se me olvida esa noche en Ibiza
Un beso el alma me friza
Deten el tiempo, no hay prisa bebe


Como olvidar, ese preciso y unico momento
Un beso no es una palabra, que esa se la lleva el viento
Si es un pecado, Dios mio lo siento
Pero tu sabes que por la noche yo estoy sufriendo
Asi, asi, solo yo me siento
Tu sabes que no es justo pa' mi sentimiento
Otra mujer no supera tu movimiento

Bajame de la nube, mujer
Fue cosa de un dia, yo se
Que se repita que yo se que el mundo se puede acabar
Bajame de la nube, mujer
Fue cosa de un dia, yo se
Que se repita que yo se que el mundo se puede acabar


Yo se que tu amor es puro peligro
Yo se, ahora cuando duermo tengo delirio

Porque-

No se me olvida esa noche en Ibiza
En el muelle con la brisa
Flamenco y tu sonrisa

No se me olvida esa noche en Ibiza
Un beso el alma me friza
Deten el tiempo, no hay prisa bebe

Y esta melancolia
Me tiene en musa de noche y de dia
Tengo un cuaderno con cien mil canciones
Cincuenta poemas y tu no eres mia
Y solo por un beso
Yo mismo me someto a preso
Y luego botare la llave
En el oceano tan inmenso

Yo se que tu amor es puro peligro

Yo se, ahora cuando duermo tengo delirio

The Beatlllionare
Bebe
Yeah!

Ya te conozco, lo veo en tu cara
No te comportes, conmigo puedes ser mala
Sere tuyo por esta noche
Te soltaras antes que desabroche el cinturon
Dime que posiciones tu quieres
Se que tiene' novio, pero a mi es que me prefiere
Sere tuyo por esta noche

Preparate, bebe, porque hoy yo quiero comerte toda
El te lo hace a medias, yo te beso toda
Quedate conmigo y le picheo a todas
Como tu, ninguna, tu le ganas a todas
Por eso bebe yo quiero comerte toda
El te lo hace a medias, yo te beso toda
Quedate conmigo y le picheo a todas
El te tiene seca, yo te mojo toda
Yo te mojo toda, bebe

To' el mundo te quiere porque como tu ninguna
Y yo por ti saco hasta poderes y te bajo la luna
Hay muchas mujeres, la vida es solo una
Y solo dime que si pa' ponertelo de una
Bebesita solo avisa
Pa' subir los cristales, prender y quitarme la camisa
Quiero que seas mi sumisa
Si quieres tomate tu tiempo, tranquila no tengo prisa
Que la noche es joven y el jevo tuyo no se da cuenta
Ese cabron es feka no tiene lo que aparenta, yeh
Tu eres mucho pa' el, eso es lo que comentan

(Lenny Tavarez, baby)
No se si nos queremos (nos queremos)
Tu estas con el, pero hace tiempo que nos vemos
Siempre que estamo' a solas, bellaqueamo' y nos comemos
Conmigo, tus venias se van al extremo
Y ese cabron con esa pelicula
Ya tu no sales con el, te sientes ridicula
Prefieres quedarte solita en la casa pa' asi llamarme
Y yo, puesto pa' buscarte cuando me necesitas
Enviame un Snapchat de eso'
Un selfie tirandome beso'
Voy de camino a bajarte el queso
Cuando cruze la linea, no me equivoque
Si te descubren, di que yo te provoque

Porque hoy yo quiero comerte toda
El te lo hace a medias, yo te beso toda
Quedate conmigo y le picheo a todas
Como tu, ninguna, tu le ganas a todas
Por eso, bebe, yo quiero comerte toda
El te lo hace a medias, yo te beso toda
Quedate conmigo y le picheo a todas
Me dices, bebesita, y nos vamos a todas
Pa' comerte toda, yeh

Ly-Ly-Ly
Contigo tengo fantasias desde la high
Esposas y correas, sabes lo que hay
Hasta una con el Kush pa' ponerte high
Y en la cama a tu novio ya decirle "Bye"
Bruto, bruto con cojone'
Siempre usando el condon y pa' colmo te pone todas mis cancione'
Pa' dejarlo te dice 'sentinueve y mil razones
Tu toto late por mi, mas que hace corazones
Y lo hacemo' lento
Cuando nos besamo', se detiene el tiempo
Sin palabras, disfrutamos el momento
Y repetimos el cuento

Baby, porque quiero maltratarte toda
El te lo hace a medias, yo te beso toda
Quedate conmigo y le picheo a todas
Como tu, ninguna, tu le ganas a todas

(Yeah, Ra-Rauw)
Te hicieron para mi
Lo supe aquella noche que te tuve
Apreciando toda tu desnudez
Cuando mi lengua corria toda tu piel
Me hicieron para ti
Lo supiste cuando gritabas mi nombre
Baby, yo soy el que te corresponde
Que rico fumar antes de comernos
El destino nos cambio to' los planes
Tu dime cuando pa' volver a vernos
Tienes algo mas cabron, ya olvidate de el

Ademas del sexo, mami, quiero amarte toda
Conmigo vas al cielo, tu te vienes toda
Quedate conmigo y le picheo a todas
Me dices, bebesita, que nos vamos a todas
Contigo voy a todas, yeh

Como quieras, papi, rapido o lento
Soy adicta a tu movimiento
Y aunque hay veces que yo te miento
En las noches se me nota lo que siento por ti
Hay gente diciendo no, que somo' anormale'
Siempre nos comemo' como si fuesemo' animale'
Es logico que me reclame'
Y sabes que si estoy con el, me llamas y desarmo los plane'
Sabe bien que como yo no hay dos
Prendiendo uno haciendolo
Olvidandono' del reloj
Y que cuando ella te habla, tu te imaginas mi voz
Yo ya lo descubri, que tu eres para mi, que yo soy para ti
Baby, quedate aqui, mas cerquita de mi, el no me lo hace asi

Tu quieres comerme toda
El me lo hace a medias, tu me besas toda
Quedate conmigo y picheale a todas
Como yo, ninguna, yo le gano a todas
Ven comeme toda
Hoy yo quiero comerte toda
El te lo hace a medias, yo te beso toda
Quedate conmigo y le picheo a todas
Me dices, bebesita, y nos vamos a todas
Pa' comerte toda, yeh

Got me goin' crazy

Okay, I been up for some days, I ain't got time to lay
Just to drown out all these thoughts, I tried all kind of things
If I take you to my past you will be traumatized
Got a thousand kids outside that's tryna come alive
'99, took AstroWorld, it had to relocate
Told the dawgs I'd bring it back, it was a seal of faith
Before no car notes, baby girl, she played the tourist guide
Got the keys into my city, now she know the rides
Got new money, got new problems, got new enemies
When you make it to the top, that's the amenities
Packin' out Toyota like I'm in the league
And it ain't a mosh pit if ain't no injuries
I got 'em stage divin' out the nosebleeds
(Alright, alright, alright)
And she hit that booger sugar 'til her nose bleed
(Alright, alright, alright)
Bounce that shit forever, she on both knees
She was talkin' 'bout forever, got a whole week
(Alright, alright, alright)
Plus she know my baby mama is a trophy
She be throwing up them B's, feel like we both bleed
She keep my dick jumpin' up, feel like I'm Moby
I'm way too gold for this beef, feel like I'm Kobe, yeah
This right here is astronomical
I see you picked up all my ways, I feel responsible
They tryna say that all my problems is improbable
They keep itching at my spirit, I'm diabolical
Ya feel me?

I'd stop the world if it gave us time

'Cause when you love someone
You open up your heart
When you love someone
You make room
If you love someone
And you're not afraid to lose 'em
You probably never loved someone like I do
You probably never loved someone like I do

When you say
You love the way I make you feel
Everything becomes so real
Don't be scared, no, don't be scared
'Cause you're all I need

And you still look perfect as days go by
Even the worst ones, you make me smile
I'd stop the world if it gave us time

'Cause when you love someone
You open up your heart
When you love someone
You make room
If you love someone
And you're not afraid to lose 'em
You probably never loved someone like I do
You probably never loved someone like I do

All my life
I thought it'd be hard to find
The one 'til I found you
And I find it bittersweet
'Cause you gave me something to lose

But when you love someone
You open up your heart
When you love someone
You make room
If you love someone
And you're not afraid to lose 'em
You probably never loved someone like I do
You probably never loved someone like I do
You probably never loved someone like I do

Run that back, Turbo


You can get the biggest Chanel bag in the store if you want it
I gave 'em the drip, they sucked it up, I got 'em moanin'
I bought a new Patek, I had the watch, so I two-toned 'em
Takin' these drugs, I'm gon' be up until the mornin'
That ain't your car, you just a leaser, you don't own it
If I'm in the club, I got that fire when I'm performin'
The backend just came in, in all hundreds
Fives galore, cute shit, they all on us
I'm from Atlanta where young niggas run shit
I know they hatin' on me, but I don't read comments
Whenever I tell her to come, she comin'
Whenever it's smoke, we ain't runnin'


Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind
Soon as I get back, she gettin' slayed
Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise
Every other night, another movie gettin' made
Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind
Soon as I get back, she gettin' slayed
Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise (yeah)
Every other night, another movie gettin' made


Yeah, every other night, another dollar gettin' made
Every other night started with a good day
I feel like a child, I got boogers in the face
Diamonds dancin' in the dark like this shit is a parade
I don't want your chain, Young GonWunna not a slave
I had to draw the line, too many bitches gettin' saved
TSA harass me, so I took a private plane
These pussy niggas lackin', why I'm workin' on my aim
Drip too hard (too hard), charge it to the card (to the card)
Designer to the ground, I can barely spell the names
Drip too hard, caution on the floor
You gon' fuck around and drown tryna ride a nigga wave


Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind
Soon as I get back, she gettin' slayed
Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise
Every other night, another movie gettin' made
Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind
Soon as I get back, she gettin' slayed
Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise
Every other night, another movie gettin' made

Desde que amanecimos en esa cama
Siempre me llama, pa' matar las ganas
Que hace tiempo que con el ya no siente nada
Por eso me llama, pa’ matar las ganas

A ella le gusta porque estoy PPP
Siempre puesto pa' darle placer
Ella me pide que le de y que le de
Y yo le hago to' lo que la complace
Que soy su nene, que soy su bebe
Se pone loquita cuando me ve en la TV
Ella me pide que le de y que le de
Y yo le hago de to’, de to'

Bebe, solo tu me fascina', que rico tenerte encima
Tu boquita me domina, tu y yo bailando en una esquina
Siente el roce, roce, te vuelves loquita con las pose, pose
'Tamos en el cielo con el 2C, 2C
Tu eres mi baby personal, mi gatita exclusive

Lo nuestro sobrepasa una adiccion
No tenemos sexo hacemos el amor

A ella le gusta porque estoy PPP
Siempre puesto pa' darle placer
Ella me pide que le de y que le de
Y yo le hago to' lo que la complace
Que soy su nene, que soy su bebe
Se pone loquita cuando me ve en la TV
Ella me pide que le de y que le de
Y yo le hago de to', de to'

Tell me what you're crying for
I'll wipe your tears, oh love
If your soul is aching love
I will comfort you for sure

If we're caught in a wave, I will carry you over
It don't matter where you are, I'll run to your front door
When my head goes in different directions
You know my heart's never on the move
And in the dark times you don't have to question
If I'm a hundred with you

You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart
You could build a wall, I would run it up, up, up
Just to get to your heart
If we're caught in a wave
Baby, we'll make a way
You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart

Love, between our love
Love, between our love

Shadows play on idle hands
I lose myself, I do
But I find my way to velvet sands
I'll crash right into you

If we're caught in a wave, I will carry you over
It don't matter where we are, you're still the one I choose
When my head goes in different directions
You know my heart's never on the move
And in the dark times you don't have to question
If I'm a hundred with you

You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart
You could build a wall, I would run it up, up, up (run it up)
Just to get to your heart
If we're caught in a wave (in a wave)
Baby, we'll make a way
You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart

Love, between our love
Love, between our love

You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart
You could build a wall, I would run it up, up, up (run it up)
Just to get to your heart
If we're caught in a wave
Baby, we'll make a way
You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart
---------------------------------------------------
That Arizona sky burning in your eyes
You look at me and, babe, I wanna catch on fire
It's buried in my soul like California gold
You found the light in me that I couldn't find

So when I'm all choked up
But I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye
Baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way

Lovers in the night
Poets tryna write
We don't know how to rhyme
But damn we try
But all I really know
You're where I wanna go
The part of me that's you will never die

So when I'm all choked up
But I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye
Baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way

Oh, yeah
I don't wanna be just a memory, baby, yeah
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo hoo hooooooooo

So when I'm all choked up
But I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye
Baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way, way, yeah

When you look at me
And the whole world fades
I'll always remember us this way

Oooh, oooh, hmmmm
Oooh, oooh, hmmmm
---------------------------------------------------
Drugs got me sweatin', but the room gettin' colder
Lookin' at the devil and the angel on my shoulder
Will I die tonight? I don't know, is it over?
Lookin' for my next high, I'm lookin' for closure

Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys

Told her if I die I'ma die young
Every day I've been gettin' fucked up
Finally know the difference between love and drugs
Shawty tell me I should really sober up
This shit ain't fiction, it's too real, too real
Fuck one dose, I need two pills, two pills
I'm lookin' for trouble so I know I'm gonna find it
Ring, ring, plug hit my phone, perfect timin'
I know I'm not right
But I'm not wrong, no, I'm not wrong
Girl, you hate it when I'm too high
But that's where I belong, where I belong

Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys

Eyes red, no Visine
Crashed the Mustang, no Saleen
Yeah, I love beans, yeah, I love lean
I laugh when they ask if my piss clean
Huh, smoke with me, huh, pop with me, huh
Ayy, Gucci store, come and shop with me
If I overdose, bae, are you gon' drop with me?
I don't even wanna think about that right now
Let's get too high, reach a new height
Take the shrooms and the pills at the same time
Went to Hollywood thrills from the street life
Took too many drugs, now I don't feel right

Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys (Bad kidneys)

Bailemos sin importar quien este viendo
Y yo te quiero tener conmigo, conmigo
Yo quiero pasarla bien contigo, contigo
Hoy yo te quiero tener conmigo, conmigo
Y ver el amanecer contigo, contigo

(More fire)

Sabes que no nos conviene
Que la gente sepa lo que ambos tenemos
Que comemos de una fruta prohibida
Nos encanta y lo sabemos, jajaja
Yo no necesito ningun otro Don Juan
Que me abra la puerta cuando llego a un restaurant
En San Valentin no necesito mas flores
Tu calla'ito pa' evitar to' los rumores

Lo nuestro es ilegal y no te voy a negar
Que yo pago la condena por besarte (muack)
Se que a ti te pasa igual y no me puedes negar
Que ya cometi el error de enamorarme (yeh, yeh)

Yo vine a verte, a entretenerme
Y me robaste un beso que aun no piensas devolverme
Me sentia volando, me iba escapando
Cuando menos pensaba, ya me estabas abrazando
Y sigue asi, no pares ya
Te has convertido en una enfermedad
Y sigue asi, asi, no mas
Que mientras mas te acercas
Mas aumentas mi ansiedad

(More fire!)

Clan-clan-clandestino, oh
Asi mismo lo quiso el destino
No busques problemas donde no los hay, los hay, los hay
Clan-clan-clandestino, oh
No te olvides que somos amigos
Yo busco problemas donde no los hay, los hay, los hay
Oh, yeah, oh
Yo busco problemas donde no los hay, los hay, los hay

(Mira!)

Dime, mai, porque ya no entiendo la necesidad
De vernos a solas y matarnos en la oscuridad
Tu te vas, y mi cuerpo aqui sigue pidiendo mas

Tu sigue con esa actitud
Cuando se apaga la luz
Tu te vuelves loca
Con par de besitos en la boca, muack

Lo nuestro es ilegal y no te voy a negar
Que yo pago la condena por besarte (muack)
Se que a ti te pasa igual y no me puedes negar
Que ya cometi el error de enamorarme

Yo vine a verte, a entretenerme
Y me robaste un beso que aun no piensas devolverme
Me sentia volando, me iba escapando
Cuando menos pensaba, ya me estabas abrazando
Y sigue asi, no pares ya
Te has convertido en una enfermedad
Y sigue asi, asi, no mas
Que mientras mas te acercas
Mas aumentas mi ansiedad

(More fire!)

Clan-clan-clandestino, oh
Asi mismo lo quiso el destino
No busques problemas donde no los hay, los hay, los hay
Clan-clan-clandestino, oh
No te olvides que somos amigos
Yo busco problemas donde no los hay, los hay, los hay (aja)
Ohh, yeah, oh
Yo busco problemas donde no los hay, los hay, los hay

(Mira!)

Clan-clan-clandestino, oh
Asi mismo lo quiso el destino
No busques problemas donde no los hay, los hay, los hay
Clan-clan-clandestino, oh
No te olvides que somos amigos
No busques problemas donde no los hay, los hay, los hay

---------------------------------------------------
Remember the words you told me? "Love me 'til the day I die"
Surrender my everything 'cause you made me believe you're mine
Yeah, you used to call me baby, now you're calling me by name
Takes one to know one, yeah, you beat me at my own damn game

You push and you push and I'm pulling away, pulling away from you
I give and I give and I give and you take, give and you take

Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me out of your life
And I'm just a dead man walking tonight
But you need it, yeah you need it, all of the time, yeah ooh ooh ooh
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me back in your life
So I'm just a dead man crawling tonight
'Cause I need it, yeah I need it, all of the time, yeah ooh ooh ooh

Lately our conversations end like it's the last goodbye
Then one of us gets too drunk and calls about a hundred times
So who you been calling baby? Nobody could take my place
When you're looking at those strangers, hope to God you see my face

Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me out of your life
And I'm just a dead man walking tonight
But you need it, yeah you need it, all of the time, yeah ooh ooh ooh

---------------------------------------------------
You sound like a bitch, bitch
Shut the fuck up
When your fans become your haters
You done?
Fuckin' beard's weird
Alright
You yellin' at the mic, fuckin' weird beard (You want smoke)
We doin' this once
You yellin' at the mic, your beard's weird
Why you yell at the mic? (Illa)

Rihanna just hit me on a text
Last night I left hickeys on her neck
Wait, you just dissed me? I'm perplexed
Insult me in a line, compliment me on the next
Damn, I'm really sorry you want me to have a heart attack
Was watchin' 8 Mile on my NordicTrack
Realized I forgot to call you back
Here's that autograph for your daughter, I wrote it on a Starter cap
Stan, Stan, son
Listen, man, Dad isn't mad
But how you gonna name yourself after a damn gun
And have a man-bun?
The giant's woke, eyes open, undeniable
Supplyin' smoke, got the fire stoked
Say you got me in a scope, but you grazed me
I say one call to Interscope and you're Swayze
Your reply got the crowd yelling, "Woo!"
So before you die let's see who can out-petty who
With your corny lines ("Slim, you're old") -ow, Kelly, ooh
But I'm 45 and I'm still outselling you
By 29, I had three albums that had blew
Now let's talk about somethin' I don't really do
Go in someone's daughter's mouth stealin' food
But you're a fuckin' mole hill
Now I'ma make a mountain out of you, woo!
Ho, chill, actin' like you put the chrome barrel to my bone marrow
Gunner? Bitch, you ain't a bow and arrow
Say you'll run up on me like a phone bill, sprayin' lead (Brrt)
Playin' dead, that's the only time you hold still (Hold up)
Are you eating cereal or oatmeal?
What the fuck's in the bowl, milk? Wheaties or Cheerios?
'Cause I'm takin' a shit in 'em, Kelly, I need reading material
...Dictionary...
"Yo, Slim, your last four albums sucked
Go back to Recovery," oh shoot, that was three albums ago
What do you know? Oops
Know your facts before you come at me, lil' goof
Luxury, oh, you broke, bitch? Yeah, I had enough money in '02
To burn it in front of you, ho
Younger me? No, you the wack me, it's funny but so true
I'd rather be 80-year-old me than 20-year-old you
'Til I'm hitting old age
Still can fill a whole page with a ten-year-old's rage
Got more fans than you in your own city, lil' kiddy, go play
Feel like I'm babysitting Lil Tay
Got the Diddy okay so you spent your whole day
Shootin' a video just to fuckin' dig your own grave
Got you at your own wake, I'm the billy goat
You ain't never made a list next to no Biggie, no Jay
Next to Taylor Swift and that Iggy ho, you about to really blow
Kelly, they'll be putting your name
Next to Ja, next to Benzino-die, motherfucker!
Like the last motherfucker sayin' Hailie in vain
Alien brain, you Satanist (Yeah)
My biggest flops are your greatest hits
The game's mine again and ain't nothin' changed but the locks
So before I slay this bitch I, mwah, give Jade a kiss
Gotta wake up Labor Day to this (The fuck?)
Bein' rich-shamed by some prick usin' my name for clickbait
In a state of bliss 'cause I said his goddamn name
Now I gotta cock back, aim
Yeah, bitch, pop Champagne to this! (Pop)
It's your moment
This is it, as big as you're gonna get, so enjoy it
Had to give you a career to destroy it
Lethal injection
Go to sleep six feet deep, I'll give you a B for the effort
But if I was three-foot-eleven
You'd look up to me, and for the record
You would suck a dick to fuckin' be me for a second
Lick a ballsack to get on my channel
Give your life to be as solidified
This mothafuckin' shit is like Rambo when he's out of bullets
So what good is a fuckin' machine gun when it's out of ammo?
Had enough of this tatted-up mumble rapper
How the fuck can him and I battle?
He'll have to fuck Kim in my flannel
I'll give him my sandals
'Cause he knows, long as I'm Shady he's gon' have to live in my shadow
Exhausting, letting off on my offspring
Lick a gun barrel, bitch, get off me!
You dance around it like a sombrero, we can all see
You're fuckin' salty
'Cause Young Gerald's balls-deep inside of Halsey
Your red sweater, your black leather
You dress better, I rap better
That a death threat or a love letter?
Little white toothpick
Thinks it's over a pic, I just don't like you, prick
Thanks for dissing me
Now I had an excuse on the mic to write "Not Alike"
But really I don't care who's in the right
But you're losin' the fight you picked
Who else want it? Kells?
Attempt fails! Budden, L's!
Fuckin' nails in these coffins as soft as Cottonelle
Killshot, I will not fail, I'm with the Doc still
But this idiot's boss pops pills and tells him he's got skills
But, Kells, the day you put out a hit's the day Diddy admits
That he put the hit out that got Pac killed, ah!
I'm sick of you bein' wack
And still usin' that mothafuckin' Auto-Tune
So let's talk about it (Let's talk about it)
I'm sick of your mumble rap mouth
Need to get the cock up out it
Before we can even talk about it (Talk about it)
I'm sick of your blonde hair and earrings
Just 'cause you look in the mirror and think
That you're Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
Don't mean you are, and you're not about it
So just leave my dick in your mouth and keep my daughter out it

You fuckin'... oh
And I'm just playin', Diddy
You know I love you
---------------------------------------------------
And when you feel like your nothing
But you wanna be something
Yea
Well all you really need is hope
I just want you to trust me
If you wanna be something
Yea
Then all you really need is hope

When you're feeling down and your out
Like you got nothing but doubt
You're alone in a crowd
Just trying to figure it out
All of this clout
And the money got you feelin left out
Listen up to me now
Every word out my mouth

Wake up
It's me
You gonna follow your dreams
Or are you just gonna be
Another cog in the scene
You feel the hope in this beat
Yea the hope that you need
To proceed and be exactly what you wanted to be

I feel right and I'm proud
Hype and I'm loud
Ima shout all about
How I feel in the now
Ain't nobody every gonna try to Change me
Till I'm I'm dead pushing up daisies

I'm alone in a crowd
I won't feel down
I got hope right now
And I know I'll be found
I don't really care just what all of the haters gotta say
I know everything I do is gonna make em fade away

And when you feel like your nothing
But you wanna be something
Yea
Well all you really need is hope
I just want you to trust me
If you wanna be something
Yea
Then all you really need is hope

Yo
Take a look in the mirror
Are you seeing some fear
You hear the voice in your ear
Can you start to see clear
Are the bad thoughts near?
Or can you be where your feet are yea when you stand right here and say no!

I'm never gonna give up
I'm never gonna slow
Cause the one that doesn't give up never loses to a foe
I'm the one that can show
To myself I can go
All the way to the top
Can't stop me no
Ima soldier always closer till it's over
Older but I'm bolder moving forward
Motor never slower good know ya
Don't go make me drop my shoulder
You need to believe
You can achieve
Everything that you dream
Everything that you need
Is in the air that you breathe
Is in the mind that you feed
Is in the time that you bleed
Every second alive
Is another blessing to me

And when you feel like your nothing
But you wanna be something
Yea
Well all you really need is hope
I just want you to trust me
If you wanna be something
Yea
Then all you really need is hope

It's what you need when your down
Need when your out
What you need when your sad
And when you feel left out
You feel an energy drought
And in creeps doubt
But with a little bit of hope
You can figure it out
Keep your head high
Even when your down inside
Through the pain you fight
And through the painful nights
You keep striving
Keep trying
Keep driving
Rising
Keep thriving
Surviving
Nothings in your way but yourself
Don't need nobody's help
You can make it through this hell
Take it one step at a time
One step as you climb
If you fail you'll be fine
Get back up to the grind
And never lose sight of your mission
Be driven
This live is a prison
If you don't have a vision
Your in it to win it
So get it don't miss it
Your chance is now
To be something somehow
Don't let yourself down

Saint Laurent feet, put it on toes
Take it with me, double your dose
Covered with angels that's watchin' my soul
Jet got a bed, it's bigger windows
Said I'll be there in ten, but I got there in four

I feel like I'm chosen, I'm covered in gold
Mmm-hmm-mmm-hmm-mmm-hmm-mmm

Thirty pointers and up, Eliantte, drippin', my whole team wet
---------------------------------------------------
Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood

Laying on the bathroom floor, feeling nothing
I'm overwhelmed and insecure, give me something
I could take to ease my mind slowly
Just have a drink and you'll feel better
Just take her home and you'll feel better
Keep telling me that it gets better
What does it ever?

Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me
I'm crawling in my skin
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't

It isn't in my blood
It isn't in my blood

Looking through my phone again feeling anxious
Afraid to be alone again, I hate this
I'm trying to find a way to chill, can't breathe
Oh, is there somebody who could help me

It's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me
Oh, I'm crawling in my skin
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't

It isn't in my blood
It isn't in my blood

I need somebody now
I need somebody now
Someone to help me out
I need somebody now

Help me
It's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't

It isn't in my blood
It isn't in my blood, ohhh
It isn't in my blood
I need somebody now
It isn't in my blood
I need somebody now
It isn't in my blood
It isn't in my blood
---------------------------------------------------
Bite my tongue, bide my time
Wearing a warning sign
Wait 'til the world is mine
Visions I vandalize
Cold in my kingdom size
Fell for these ocean eyes

You should see me in a crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by
You should see me in a crown
Your silence is my favorite sound
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by one

Count my cards, watch them fall
Blood on a marble wall
I like the way they all
Scream
Tell me which one is worse
Living or dying first
Sleeping inside a hearse
I don't dream

You say, "Come over, baby
I think you're pretty."
I'm okay, I'm not your baby
If you think I'm pretty

You should see me in a crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by
You should see me in a crown
Your silence is my favorite sound
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by one

Crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by
You should see me in a crown (You should see me, see me)
Your silence is my favorite sound (You should see me, see me)
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by one

I just wanna go back, back to 1999
Take a ride to my old neighborhood
I just wanna go back, sing "Hit me, baby, one more time"
Wanna go back, wanna go

Yeah, I just wanna go back
Nike Airs, All That
CD, old Mercedes
Drive 'round listening to Shady like, oh
Never under pressure, oh
Those days, it was so much better, oh
Feelin' cool in my youth, relaxin'
No money, no problem
It was easy back then

Ooh, wish that we could go back in time, uh
Got memories
Ooh, maybe we could do it tonight
Tonight's the night

I just wanna go back, back to 1999
Take a ride to my old neighborhood
I just wanna go back
Sing "Hit me, baby, one more time"
Wanna go back, wanna go

Yeah, I remember back home
Best friends, all night, no phone
No cares, I was dumb and so young
My room singing Michael Jackson (Hee, hee)
Never under pressure, oh
Those days it was so much better, oh
Feelin' cool in my youth, I'm askin'
"Does anyone remember how we did it back then?"

Ooh, wish that we could go back in time, uh
Got memories
Ooh, maybe we could do it tonight
Tonight's the night
Ah, yeah

I just wanna go back, back to 1999
Take a ride to my old neighborhood
I just wanna go back
Sing "Hit me, baby, one more time"
Wanna go back, wanna go

Back to where we came from
Playin' air guitar on the roof
In the kitchen, up on the table
Like we had a beautiful view
I wanna go
I just wanna go back, back to 1999
Ah, yeah

Back to 1999
I know those days are over, but a boy can fantasize
'Bout JTT on MTV and when I close my e-e-eyes
And I'm right there, right there
And he's right there, right there
And we're right there, right there
Ah, ah, ah, I wanna go back

I just wanna go back (Yeah), back to 1999
Take a ride to my old neighborhood
I just wanna go back
Sing "Hit me, baby, one more time"
Wanna go back, wanna go

Back to where we came from (Came from)
Playin' air guitar on the roof (Ah)

Go back, yeah, yeah
I just wanna go back, yeah, back to 1999
Take me back to '99 (Yeah)

Hello, sweet grief
I know you will be the death of me
Feel like the morning after ecstasy
I am drowning in an endless sea

Hello, old friend
Here's the misery that knows no end
So I'm doing everything I can
To make sure I never love again

I wish that I did not know
Where all broken lovers go
I wish that my heart was made of stone
Yeah, if I was bulletproof
I'd love you black and blue
If I was solid like a jewel

If I had a diamond heart
Oh, oh
I'd give you all my love
If I was unbreakable
If I had a diamond heart
Oh, oh
You could shoot me with a gun of gold
If I was unbreakable

I'd walk straight through the bullet
Bend like a tulip
Blue-eyed and foolish
Never mind the bruises
Into the fire
Breakin' through the wires
Give you all I've got

(If I had a diamond heart)
I'd walk straight through the dagger
Never break the pattern
Diamonds don't shatter
Beautiful and battered
Into the poison
Cry you an ocean
Give you all I've got

Goodbye, so long
I don't know if this is right or wrong
Am I giving up where I belong?
'Cause every station is playing our song

Goodbye, my love
You are everything my dreams made of
You'll be Prince and I'm the crying dove
If I only were unbreakable

I wish that I did not know
Where all broken lovers go
I wish that my heart was made of stone
Yeah, if I was bulletproof
I'd love you black and blue
If I was solid like a jewel

If I had a diamond heart
Oh, oh
I'd give you all my love
If I was unbreakable
If I had a diamond heart
Oh, oh
You can shoot me with a gun of gold
If I was unbreakable

I'd walk straight through the bullet
Bend like a tulip
Blue-eyed and foolish
Never mind the bruises
Into the fire
Breakin' through the wires
Give you all I've got

(If I had a diamond heart)
I'd walk straight through the dagger
Never break the pattern
Diamonds don't shatter
Beautiful and battered
Into the poison
Cry you an ocean
Give you all I've got

La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la

La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
I'd give you all my love
If I was unbreakable
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
You can shoot me with a gun of gold
If I was unbreakable

I'd walk straight through the bullet
Bend like a tulip
Blue-eyed and foolish
Never mind the bruises
Into the fire
Breakin' through the wires
Give you all I've got

(If I had a diamond heart)
I'd walk straight through the dagger
Never break the pattern
Diamonds don't shatter
Beautiful and battered
Into the poison
Cry you an ocean
Give you all I've got
---------------------------------------------------
Ooh, yeah, yeah

I put my feelings on safety
So I don't go shootin' where your heart be
'Cause you take the bullet tryna save me
Then I'm left to deal with makin' you bleed

And that's a whole lotta love, ain't tryna waste it
Like we be runnin' a mile to never make it
That's just too bitter for worse, don't wanna taste it
That's just too bitter for worse, don't wanna face it

But I tripped on your love, now I'm addicted

And that's a whole lotta love, ain't tryna waste it
Like we be runnin' a mile to never make it
That's just too bitter for worse, don't wanna taste it
That's just too bitter for worse, don't wanna face it

Los asesinos
Wo-oh-oh, brr
Real Hasta la Muerte, baby
¡Este es el remix!
Uah


Mi mente malda' (Si-si)
Bebo pa' recordarte
Y tu que me llamas
Pa' que pase a buscarte
Quiero darte (Eso e' asi, eso e' asi)
Como la ultima vez que lo hicimo', mami
Quiero darte (The Real Rondon)
Yo quiero darte, bebe, quiero darte, bebe, eh
(Brytiago)


No vo' a negarte que bien dura te ve' (Eso e' asi)
Puede ser que borracho un dia vuelva y te de (Pa' que sepa')
Ojala y terminemo' como la ultima ve' (Por ley)
Que sea quien te enamore y que no me vuelva' a ver


(The Big Boss, fuego)
Asesina, yo se que tu eres mala
Por eso, traje chaleco antibala'
Chambeaste en el asalto y terminaste en mi cuarto
Porque al final, conmigo, te resbala'
Tu te haces la loca, loca, inteligente
Como me conoce', juega con mi mente
To' el mundo es loco hasta que tiene otro de frente
De nacimiento, una demente
Dale, ponte suci, pon la nalga' en el suelo
Vamo' pa' un entierro, pero no te velo
Yo soy como el Lambo, te zumbo el veneno
Mami, yo te piso y te aplico el freno
Sicaria, tu no-tu no va' a cambiar
A ti te gusta el peligro, y asi te va' a quedar


(It's The Real Rondon, ra-ta-ta-ta)
Tu eres un problema serio (¡Ja!)
Porque no tienes corazon, ya esta muerto en el cementerio (eso e' asi)
No le hagas caso a los intermedios
Que se salgan del medio
Sin condon contigo me voy a criterio
Cuando estamos junto', mami, todo es bello
Tu sabes que no ronco mucho, pero tengo mas que ellos (¡Ja-ja!)
Desenmona tu, que el phillie yo lo sello
Cuando suba la nota, ponte en cuatro en lo que yo te estrello
(Real G4 Life, my nigga)
Ese tipo te tiene aborrecia (Aborrecia)
Tu dices que estas confundi'a (Confundi'a)
Te pelea 'e noche y te pelea 'e dia
Pero tu ere' masoquista porque sigue' ahi meti'a (Ahi meti'a)
Yo te vo'a dar duro por creci'a (Por creci'a)
Te vo'a jalar tu pelo por lucia (Por lucia)
Pegate pa' darte una barri'a
Y cuando llegue el otro dia me va' a decir na' perdi'a


No vo' a negarte que bien dura te ve' (Eso e' asi)
Puede ser que borracho un dia vuelva y te de (Pa' que sepa')

Ojala y terminemo' como la ultima ve' (Por ley)
Que sea quien te enamore y que no me vuelva' a ver


Anuel (Uah)
Tu eres una diabla, y yo soy un demonio
Y yo amo a tu totito, pero a ti te odio
Hija del diablo, odia el matrimonio
Pero tu amiga a mi bicho custodio
Y no me arrepenti
Ya no tengo bicho pa' ti
Y en el cuello ahora tengo cien mil
Bebe, te bote y de ti me olvide (Uah)
Y tengo cien putas, no son veintitres (Jaja)
Dios mio, perdon
Pero pa' mi, ella se murio (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Ella me fallo
Y viro, pero ya se jodio (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Los kilo' en el jet
Gaste cien mil en el Porsche
Bebe, Louis Vuitton en mis pies
Mala mujer, no te lo vo'a volver a meter

No vo' a negarte que bien rica te ve', eh-eh
Yo se que ni borracho yo te meto otra ve' (Eh-eh)
Y ya yo ni me acuerdo de la ultima ve'
Y te lo juro por mi vida, no te vuelvo a romper, eh-eh


(Brytiago)
Maliciosa, siempre tiene lo que quiere
Solo me busca' cada vez que te conviene
Se pone dificil, su orgullo no hay quien lo frene
Por mas que brinque' y salte', baby, aqui tu muere'
Y ahora estas bien suelta
Dos tragos y me pongo pa' la vuelta
Pa' hacer un pacto el diablo me tienta
Jugando con mi mente eres experta
Entre esa' piernas tu tiene' poderes
Por eso sigo aqui aunque pelees
Decirte que no, desnu'a no se puede
No voy a negar que la clave la tiene'
Pero peleando, estas cincuenta y cero a lo Mayweather


Ojala se repita
Yo quiero una, una proba'ita
Recordemo', bebecita
Como en la guagua mis cancione' tu las gritas
Como de kryptonita
Y ese bootysote que amerita
(Ma'-ma') No puedo olvidar tu forma 'e besar
Como te comia y el llamandote pa' pelear
Ahora, si quieres, nos vamo' en jet para asegurar
Tranquila, que ese se muere como diga que te va a tocar
Yo lo se, bebe
Recordemos como es que lo haciamo'
Pero no olvidemo' como nos comiamo', bebe


No vo' a negarte que bien dura te ve', eh-eh
Yo se que ni borracho yo te meto otra ve' (Pa' que sepa')

Ojala y terminemo' como la ultima ve'
Y te lo juro por mi vida, no te vuelvo a romper, eh-eh

---------------------------------------------------
Can you hear me? Am I speaking clearly?
Are you starstruck or just made of stone?
Do you need a savior? Some bad behavior?
Or you could cash it all in, I suppose

Because you're in deep, resist and repeat
Face forward and don't come unhinged
Block out the actors and all these bastards
That took all the fun out of rage and revenge

Don't be so quick to judge, reign havoc from above
I think I've had enough, time to raise the dead
It's all subliminal, supernatural
I might be mental but I've still got my cred

So welcome to the party, won't you please come inside?
Where habits have teeth and the words carry knives
You enter at your own risk, so don't be surprised
Welcome to the darkside

Spare me your sorrow, there's no tomorrow
That's an empty promise at best
I tried to play nice, you were baptized in ice
So don't tell me you're just depressed

Don't be so quick to judge, reign havoc from above
I think I've had enough, time to raise the dead
It's all subliminal, supernatural
I might be mental but I've still got my cred

So welcome to the party, won't you please come inside?
Where habits have teeth and the words carry knives
You enter at your own risk, so don't be surprised
Welcome to the darkside

Your equilibrium has been spun all around
And everything you know turned upside down
The symptoms are contagious so please be advised
So welcome to the darkside

Don't be so quick to judge, reign havoc from above
I think I've had enough, time to raise the dead
It's all subliminal, supernatural
I might be mental but I've still got my cred

So welcome to the party, won't you please come inside?
Where habits have teeth and the words carry knives
You enter at your own risk, so don't be surprised
Welcome to the darkside

Your equilibrium has been spun all around
And everything you know turned upside down
The symptoms are contagious so please be advised
So welcome to the darkside

(Darkside, darkside) Welcome to the darkside
(Darkside, darkside) Welcome to the darkside
(Darkside, darkside) So welcome to the darkside
(Darkside, darkside) So welcome to the darkside

---------------------------------------------------
I got a story to tell, you know that I cherish thee
Hope it ain't too many feelings involved

I see niggas in this bitch stuntin', poppin' bottles
Gettin' drunk with these bitches, and when they leave they get followed
Fall asleep with that bitch and really don't know much about her
Then she let us in, we take all of your shit, and when you wake up, she help you try to find it, I love it

I be with bitches that be with bitches that be with niggas with riches
I tell her, "Get him," she say, "I got you," I say, "No, bitch, I said get him"
And they so pretty, and they hair lengthy, he hit it and sleep on her titties
Then she give us the word, we come through with AKs, it's a stick-up, she scream like a victim
Now you feelin' so silly, I smoke color purple, I'm up in here feelin' like Celie (Ooh)
Nappy-ass dreads, what's that you say? Watch your mouth, Milli Vanilli (Ooh)
You can get snaked, you can get faked out by the bitch that you feelin'
'Cause you thought that she was an angel, that bitch ain't no angel, I treat her halo like a Frisbee
And you tellin' your business, she tell me your business, you tell that bitch what you feelin'
All of the beans you be spillin', to you, she lie through her teeth cavities, fillin's
She know where you hide it tell me where it's hidden, she know when you're gone, tell me when to visit
We break in your home and take the specifics, and meanwhile, the bitch is on vacation with him
So she don't get blamed, we don't snatch chains, we find out addresses, and we don't leave messes
You'll only know that it's gone when you checkin', then your first thought is to start second guessin'
She say, "What's wrong?" He say, "Nothin', keep restin'," she say, "What's missin'?" "How you know somethin' missin'?"
He scratch his head, she say, "Get back in bed," and she gave him some head
Boy, you can't trust them bitches, and then she say, "Ooh"

I see niggas in this bitch stuntin', poppin' bottles
Gettin' drunk with these bitches, then when they leave they get followed
I be with bitches that know the bitches that's with the niggas we followin'
Get them on the line, stay two cars behind and tell them hoes, "Don't be so obvious!"
Mona Lisa, long hair, don't care
She handle the business and don't ever tell, she bite the bullet and cough up the shells
She tell 'em, "Ooh, daddy, let's go to your place," and if he say yeah, then we meet him there
She feed him lies with his silverware, she don't want love, she just want her share

I know a bitch named Liz, this nigga think she his 'cause she tell him that it is
So he tell her all his secrets, he tell her all his fears, and then she tell me and I be all ears
And then I go and tell my people, and they already know him, and then I call Liz, and she say he comin' over
I say, "Good girl, just remember what I told you," she gave me the salute, I say, "Girl, you're a soldier"
We're waitin' outside, watch him pull up, walk up to the door and right before he knock
She open the door naked, she left it unlocked, they started French kissin' so he didn't see moi
And then she let him in, they stopped on the couch, music up loud with his head in the clouds
Turn that shit down, and I scared the piss out of him, piss a nigga off, put a gun to his frown
"Nigga, turn around, I ain't here to fuck around, I ain't here to fuck around, caught you wit' your pants down
You know what it is, put your fuckin' hands up, Liz, that's enough, you can put your hands down"
And then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her, she a good actress, and you a dead actor
You'll be dead after we get what we're after, if Liz call you daddy, she about to be a bastard, oh
I got way too many bitches that do anything for me, nigga, but think for me, nigga
Send her to you like she ain't for me, nigga, I hope you alone like bankruptcy, nigga
She pour you a drink, that drank on me, nigga, she slip somethin' in it, now faint for me, nigga
Mona Lisa, I done painted the picture, Mo-Mona Lisa, out the frame on these niggas
Pussy got you out of character, nigga, you fall for these hoes off your ladder, my nigga
Take everythin' that you have 'til you don't even have an opinion, we have your attention
And now you're lookin' down a barrel though, nigga, now she lookin' for her pantyhose, nigga
We just lookin' for the casserole, nigga, but she gon' show us where you stash it though, nigga (Mona)

Ah, every day she wake up with a different color makeup and a promise he gone take her to the movie and the mall
Chillin' with the Laker, on the floor, fourth quarter, four minute on the clock, Black Mamba with the ball
Paparazzi lookin' at 'em both poppin' up and take a picture, uh, probably on a Internet blog
In a minute, he gon' be admittin' that he love her on his mother, man, he want to meet her mother by tomorrow
(Mona Lisa) Pussy good enough, it got him sinnin' in the walls
And he diggin' in it like he livin' in it, make a new religion with it, man a nigga 'bout to go against God
Poetry in a pear tree, sweet tone like a hummingbird when she asked him
Did he want to make love in a yellow taxi? Never gave two fucks, jumped in the backseat
Woke up in the mornin' to The Great Gatsby, then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie
I'm a dog in the wind, I'm a pit laughin', I'ma call up again like I did last week
Make good with the friend and I'm all jazzy, Britney with the twin and the girl Ashley
Found out that I fucked, he was unhappy, bitch, I never let the bullshit get past me
Better yet, I wanna break up, don't you ask me 'bout a motherfuckin' double standard, actin'
Fuckin' on another nigga, that's a negative alone, but you sucked his dick? That's just nasty
Matter of fact, bitch, gimme your phone! (No) You fuckin' with Wayne's? (No!)
Bitch, gimme your phone! (No! Let me, let me take this call real quick) (... lick me like a lollipop)
He on your fuckin' ringtone? Is that the shit that you do? Touchin' yourself, lookin' at Kendrick videos
Jump on the internet, watchin' his interviews, I don't know what the fuck lately got into you
Tell me who love you, I bet I love harder, forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?
The Pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma, daycare after school and she never did charge you
You scandalous as fuck and I hope you blow up, you know what? I give up, let me go get my gun
I got one in the chamber I'm plannin' on aimin', goddammit, you know that the damage is done
Bitch, I'm emotional 'cause I'm in stress, I'm not supposed to go through this, I guess
So in conclusion, since you like rappers that's killin' that pussy, I'm killin' myself

She say, "Ooh, Daddy, ooh," Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Ooh, fake smile (Ooh), Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
She say, "Ooh," no emotion (Ooh), Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Now he get the picture, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, yeah
---------------------------------------------------
I will always remember
The day you kissed my lips
Light as a feather
And it went just like this
No, it's never been better
Than the summer of two thousand and two

We were only eleven
But acting like grown-ups
Like we are in the present
Drinking from plastic cups
Singing "love is forever and ever"
Well, I guess that was true

Dancing on the hood
In the middle of the woods
Of an old Mustang
Where we sang
Songs with all our childhood friends
And it went like this, say

Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
Better hit me, baby, one more time
Paint a picture for you and me
Of the days when we were young, uh
Singing at the top of both our lungs

Now we're under the covers
Fast forward to eighteen
We are more than lovers
Yeah, we are all we need
When we're holding each other
I'm taken back to two thousand and two

Dancing on the hood
In the middle of the woods
Of an old Mustang
Where we sang
Songs with all our childhood friends
And it went like this, say

Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
Better hit me, baby, one more time
Paint a picture for you and me
Of the days when we were young
Singing at the top of both our lungs
On the day we fell in love
On the day we fell in love

Dancing on the hood
In the middle of the woods
Of an old Mustang
Where we sang
Songs with all our childhood friends
Oh, now

Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
Better hit me, baby, one more time
Paint a picture for you and me
Of the days when we were young, uh
Singing at the top of both our lungs
On the day we fell in love
On the day we fell in love
On the day we fell in love
On the day we fell in love
On the day we fell in love, love, love
---------------------------------------------------
My bitch drive a all-white Range
Couldn't hit it if you niggas had aim
Lames can't call and you a lame
You had it then you lost it, Hall of Shame
I can buy a Bentley, don't talk to me
For a show 150, don't talk to me
You ain't never helped your mans, don't talk to me
You just follow all the trends, don't talk to me
Ayy, I set the bar, I'm the fuckin' bar
Look in the sky, I'm a fuckin' star
I don't fall in love 'cause I be lovin' hard
Do everything like my shirt, extra large
I don't care, I'll crash a Ghost
Got two cribs in two states, I be doing the most
I got white-folks money that I won't blow
And if you ask why, 'cause the white folks don't

---------------------------------------------------
Killed the demons of my mind
Ever since you came around
We're a river, running wild
How could I have been so blind?

I just live a fast life
Forget about the past time
I'm numb out to escape my feels
And friendships only pass by
Show up, gone, like strobe lights
But with you I feel something real

And I'd walk a million miles just to see your smile
Till the day I die
Oh, I need you by my side, we get high on life
Till the day we die
High on life till the day we die
High on life till the day we die
High on life till the day we die
And I'd walk a million miles, just to see your smile
Till the day I die

High on life till the day we die

Through my fingers, out of sight
How could I have let you go?
Cutting corners, turning stones
But I can only see your ghost

I just live a fast life
Forget about the past time
Numb up to escape my feels
And friendships only passed by
The show and calling strobe lights
With you I feel something real

And I'd walk a million miles just to see your smile
Till the day I die
Oh, I need you by my side, we'd get high on life
Till the day we die

High on life till the day we die
Oh, I need you by my side, we'd get high on life
Till the day we die
High on life till the day we die

And I'd walk a million miles just to see your smile
Till the day I die
Oh, I need you by my side, we'd get high on life
Till the day we die

Everybody go to the discotek!

Maldito sea ese dia que a ti te probe
Que Dios me perdone, yo no te quiero ni ver
Ere' una asesina, un diablo en cuerpo 'e mujer
Fantasma que aparecen, no vuelen a aparecer

No vo'a negarte que bien dura te ve' (eso e' asi)
Puede ser que borracho un dia vuelva y te de (pa' que sepa')
Ojala y terminemo' como la ultima ve' (por ley)
Que sea quien te enamore y que no me vuelva' a ver (it's the real rondon, ratatata)

Tu eres un problema serio (huh)
Porque no tienes corazon, ya esta muerto en el cementerio (eso e' asi)
No le hagas caso a los intermedios
Que se salgan del medio
Que sin condon contigo me voy a criterio
Cuando estamos junto', mami, todo es bello
Tu sabes que no ronco mucho, pero tengo mas que ellos
Desenmona tu, que el phillie yo lo sello
Cuando suba la nota, ponte en cuatro en lo que yo te estrello (Real G4 Life, ma nigga)
Ese tipo te tiene aborrecia (aborrecia)
Tu dices que estas confundi'a (confundi'a)
Te pelea 'e noche y te pelea 'e dia
Pero tu ere' masoquista porque sigue' ahi meti'a
Yo te vo'a dar duro por creci'a
Te vo'a jalar por pelo por lucia
Pegate pa' darte una barri'a
Y cuando llegue el otro dia me va' a decir na' perdi'a

No vo'a negarte que bien dura te ve'
Puede ser que borracho un dia vuelva y te de
Ojala y terminemo' como la ultima ve'
Que sea quien te enamore y que no me vuelva' a ver

Brytiago
Maliciosa, siempre tiene lo que quiere
Solo me busca' cada vez que te conviene
Se pone dificil, su orgullo no hay quien lo frene
Por mas que brinque' y salte', baby, aqui tu muere'
Y ahora estas bien suelta
Dos tragos y me pongo pa' la vuelta (pa que sepa')
Pa' hacer un pacto el diablo me tienta
Jugando con mi mente eres experta
Entre esa' piernas tu tiene' poderes
Por eso sigo aqui aunque pelees
Decirte que no, esnu'a no se puede
No voy a negar que la clave la tiene'
Pero peleando, estas cincuenta y cero a lo Mayweather

No vo'a negarte que bien dura te ve'
Puede ser que borracho un dia vuelva y te de
Ojala y terminemo' como la ultima ve'
Que sea quien te enamore y que no me vuelva' a ver

Nekxum
Everybody go to the discotek!
Organico coming soon

I got a song filled with shit for the strong-willed
When the world gives you a raw deal
Sets you off 'til you scream, "Piss off! Screw you!"
When it talks to you like you don't belong
Or tells you you're in the wrong field
When something's in your mitochondrial
'Cause it latched on to you, like—

Knock knock, let the devil in
Manevolent as I've ever been, head is spinnin'
This medicine's screamin', "L-L-L-Let us in!"
L-L-L-Like a salad bowl, Edgar Allan Poe
Bedridden, shoulda been dead a long time ago
Liquid Tylenol, gelatins, think my skeleton's meltin'
Wicked, I get all high when I think I've smelled the scent
Of elephant manure—hell, I meant Kahlua
Screw it, to hell with it, I went through hell with accelerants
And blew up my-my-myself again
Volkswagen, tailspin, bucket matches my pale skin
Mayo and went from Hellmann's and being rail thin
Filet-o-Fish, Scribble Jam, Rap Olympics '97 Freaknik
How can I be down? Me and Bizarre in Florida
Proof's room slept on the floor of the motel then
Dr. Dre said "hell yeah!"
And I got his stamp like a postcard, word to Mel-Man
And I know they're gonna hate
But I don't care, I barely can wait
To hit them with the snare and the bass
Square in the face, this fuckin' world better prepare to get laced
Because they're gonna taste my—

Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the—)
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the—)

I said knock knock, let the devil in
Shotgun p-p-pellets in the felt pen
Cocked, fuck around and catch a hot one
It-it's evident I'm not done
V-Venomous, the thoughts spun
Like a web and you just caught in 'em
Held against your will like a hubcap or mud flap
Beat strangler attack
So this ain't gonna feel like a love tap
Eat painkiller pills, fuck up the track
Like, what's her name's at the wheel? Danica Patrick
Threw the car into reverse at the Indy, a nut crashin'
Into ya, the back of it just mangled steel
My Mustang and the Jeep Wrangler grill
With the front smashed, much as my rear fender, assassin
Slim be a combination of an actual kamikaze and Gandhi (Gandhi)
Translation, I will probably kill us both
When I end up backin' into ya
You ain't gonna be able to tell what the fuck's happenin' to you
When you're bit with the—

Venom, adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the—)
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the—)

I said knock knock, let the devil in
Alien, E-E-Elliott phone home
Ain't no telling when this chokehold
On this game will end, I'm loco
Became a Symbiote, so
My fangs are in your throat, ho
You're snake-bitten with my—venom
With the ballpoint pen I'm
Gun cocked, bump stock, double-aught, buckshot
Tire thumper, a garrote, tie a couple knots
Fired up and caught fire, juggernaut
Punk rock, bitch, it's goin' down like Yung Joc
'Cause the Doc put me on like sunblock
Why the fuck not, you only get one shot
Ate shit 'til I can't taste it
Chased it with straight liquor
Then paint thinner, then drank 'til I faint
And awake with a headache
And I take anything in rectangular shape
Then I wait to face the demons I'm bonded to
'Cause they're chasin' me but I'm part of you
So escapin' me is impossible
I latch onto you like a—parasite
And I probably ruined your parents' life
And your childhood too
'Cause if I'm the music that y'all grew up on
I'm responsible for you retarded fools
I'm the super villain Dad and Mom was losin' their marbles to
You marvel that? Eddie Brock is you
And I'm the suit, so call me—

Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the—)
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm

I know you moved onto someone new
Hope life is beautiful
You were the light for me to find my truth
I just wanna say, thank you


Leaving to find my soul
Told her I had to go
And I know it ain't pretty
When our hearts get broke
Too young to feel this old
Watching us both turn cold
Oh, I know it ain't pretty
When two hearts get broke
Yeah, I know it ain't pretty
When two hearts get broke


I hope someday
We'll sit down together
And laugh with each other
About these days, these days
All our troubles
We'll lay to rest
And we'll wish we could come back to these days
These days
These days, these days
These days, these days


Three years of ups and downs
Nothing to show for it now
And I know it ain't pretty when the fire burns out
Calling me when I'm drunk
Remind me of what I've done
And I know it ain't pretty when you're trying to move on, yeah

I hope someday
We'll sit down together
And laugh with each other
About these days, these days
All our troubles
We'll lay to rest
And we'll wish we could come back to these days, these days

Oh I know, I know
Oh I know, I know
Oh I know, I know
These days, these days
Oh I know, I know
Oh I know, I know
Oh I know, I know
To these days, these days


Cigarettes in the ashtray
Reminiscing on those past days
I thought you'd end up with my last name
But that changed
And I traveled around the world
Think where you living at now?
I heard you moved to Austin
Got an apartment and settled down
And every once in a while
I start texting
Write a paragraph
But then I delete the message
Think about you like a past time
I could cry you a river
Get you baptised or
I wasn't ready to act right
Used to always think I'd get you back, right
They say that things fall apart
We were gonna move to Brooklyn
You were gonna study Art
Love is just a tool
To remind us who we are
And that we are not alone
And we're walking in the dark


I hope someday
We'll sit down together
And laugh with each other
About these days, these days
All our troubles
We'll lay to rest
And we'll wish we could come back to these days, these days
We'll wish we could come back to these days, these days

Tonight I got the time, tell me what you wanna do
Call the squad if you wanna rendezvous
They gon' push up on they own, I only got room for two
From the 'jects on the set, it's a Porsche, not a 'Vette
I confess, I'ma flex till they show some respect
Get away so we can make sense of your life
You was in park but I just put your shit in drive
Now coast like there's no tomorrow
Moving too fast, I'm open to drive slow (yeah)
I don't want you to wonder where I go
Can learn a lot from this and that's something that I know


Put it in drive, I'll be outside, I'll be on the way
I'll be on the way
You can meet me in five, I'll be all night, I'll be a-all day
I'll be a-all day
Put it in drive, I'll be outside, I'll be on the way
I'll be on the way
You can meet me in five, I'll be all night, I'll be a-all day
I'll be a-all day

Remix
No se dosimular lo que quiero cuando te veo
Tu tan solo con mirarme sabes cual es mi deseo
Si te atreves, pues yo quiero
Ponle una excusa a tu jevo
Si yo te busco el no se va a enterar

No te lo voy a negar (uoh-oh, uoh-oh)
Estamos claro' y ya (ah, ah, eh-eh-eh-eh)
No te lo voy a negar (this is the remix)
Estamos claro' y ya (estamos claro', estamos claro')
No te lo voy a negar (que)

Tengo un par de malas intenciones
Pero mientele a tu jevo que no quiero interrupciones
Yo se que a ti te gusta las misiones
En lo que llego a casa dialogamos y haces lo que se supone
Ay! bajito
Ella me pide suave, suave, suavesito
Baila bebe que yo no me quito
Tengo un truco ahi, y un meneito
Mezclao Dominicano, Colombiano
Y el sazon de Puerto Rico

Solo deja que yo te agarre, baby
Besos en el cuello pa' calmar la sed
Mis manos en tus caderas pa' empezar como es
No le vamo' a bajar mas nunca mama

Ba-ba-ba-ba-baila y placata, placata
Como ella lo mueve, sin parar, sin parar
Mis ganas de comerte ahora son mas fuertes
Quiero tenerte...

Y no te lo voy a negar (uoh-oh, uoh-oh)
Estamos claro' y ya (ah, ah, eh-eh-eh-eh)
No te lo voy a negar
Estamos claro' y ya (Maluma baby)

Que carajos esta pasando
Pidieron el remix, y aqui se los estoy dando
Es Maluma, el Nicky, J.Balvin y Ozuna
La combinacion ahora si que esta dura
Venga mamasita
Es que usted es tremenda cosita
No deje pa' manana lo que puede ser pa' ahorita
Mamita, ven regalame un cita
Que quiero ser el lobo, y tu mi caperucita

Dime lo que tu quieres
Que te aseguro, yo tambien quiero
Quedate tranquila manten la calma
No entrar en desespero
Entre tus piernas voy a causar aguacero
Yo soy grosero
Y no te lo voy a negar...

Lo que he visto de ti mami, no es normal
Pero no te preocupes que soy anormal
Se que a tus amigas no les debo gustar, eh

Pero ve y cuentales parte por parte
Como tenemos sex y te quito el estres
Dale otra vez

Y no te lo voy a negar
Estamos claro' y ya (ah, ah, eh-eh-eh-eh)
No te lo voy a negar
Estamos claro' y ya

Ba-ba-ba-ba-baila y placata, placata
Como ella lo mueve, sin parar, sin parar
Mis ganas de comerte ahora son mas fuertes
Quiero tenerte...

Y no te lo voy a negar
Mientras vas bailando, el remix sonando
Tu con tu pasito, nos sigues deleitando
Mientras vas bailando, el remix sonando
Tu con tu pasito, nos sigues deleitando
---------------------------------------------------
I don't see you
You're not in every window I look through
And I don't miss you
You're not in every single thing I do
I don't think we're meant to be
And you are not the missing piece

I won't hear it
Whenever anybody says your name
And I won't feel it
Even when I'm burstin' into flames
I don't regret the day I left
I don't believe that I was blessed
I'm probably lyin' to myself again

I'm alone in my head
Looking for love in a stranger's bed
But I don't think I'll find it
'Cause only you could fill this empty space
I wanna tell all my friends
But I don't think they would understand
It's somethin' I've decided
'Cause only you could fill this empty space

Space, space
This empty space
Space, space
This
'Cause only you could fill this empty space

I've been drinking
I've been doin' things I shouldn't do
Overthinking
I don't know who I am without you
I'm a liar and a cheat
I let my ego swallow me
And that's why I might never see you again

I'm alone in my head
Looking for love in a stranger's bed
But I don't think I'll find it
'Cause only you could fill this empty space
I wanna tell all my friends
But I don't think they would understand
It's somethin' I've decided
'Cause only you could fill this empty space

Space, space
This empty space
Space, space
This
'Cause only you could fill this empty space

I couldn't make you love me
I couldn't make you love me
I couldn't make you love me
I couldn't make you love me

Couldn't make you love me
I couldn't make you love me

I couldn't make you love me (Space, space)
I couldn't make you love me
(I couldn't make you love me)
I couldn't make you love me (Space, space)
I couldn't make you love me
(I couldn't make you love me)
Couldn't make you love me (Space, space)
Couldn't make you love me
---------------------------------------------------
One foot in front of the other, babe
One breath leads to another, yeah
Just keep moving
Look within for the strength today
Listen now for the voice to say
Just keep moving

Go, go, go, figure it out
Figure it out, but don't stop moving
Go, go, go, figure it out
Figure it out, you can do this

So my love, keep on running
You gotta get through today
There my love, keep on running
Gotta keep those tears at bay
Oh my love, don't stop burning
Gotta send them up in flames
In flames

Don't stop, tomorrow's another day
Don't stop, tomorrow you'll feel no pain
Just keep moving
Don't stop, the past will trip you up
You know, right now's never be enough
Just keep moving

Go, go, go, figure it out
Figure it out, but don't stop moving
Go, go, go, figure it out
Figure it out, you can do this

So my love, keep on running
You gotta get through today
There my love, keep on running
Gotta keep those tears at bay
Oh my love, don't stop burning
Gotta send them up in flames
In flames
In flames
In flames

Go, go, go, figure it out
Figure it out, but don't stop moving
Go, go, go, figure it out
Figure it out, you can do this

So my love, keep on running
You gotta get through today
There my love, keep on running
Gotta keep those tears at bay
Oh my love, don't stop burning
Gotta send them up in flames
In flames
---------------------------------------------------
Es dificil abrir mis ojos y ya o verte
Tu olor en la cama aun sigue intacto
Te he buscando en mis suenos, deseando tenerte
Y no encuentro tu rostro por mas que trato

Aun quedan tus retratos por cada rincon de la casa
Y el silecnio me habla de ti, es que sobra tanto espacio
Desde que no estas, daria todo lo que hoy me queda por tenerte
Por que vuelvas


Es que me niego a perderte
Jamas nunca verte
Me niego a acceptar que lo nuestro ya se acabo


Y es que me niego a perderte
Jamas nunca verte
Me niego a acceptar que lo nuestro ya se acabo


No puedo asimilar
Que ya tu no estas, sin ti nada es igual
Se que por el mundo no hay otra similar
¿Que tu me hiciste que no te puedo olvidar?

Ay hombre, tu me quiere' a tu manera
Mi mente quisiera que otra me quisiera
Mi corazon dice que por ti espera
Que porque volvieras, daria lo que fuera

Pero es que tu, chica, con ese pikete
Dices que me olvidaste y en tus ojos veo que mientes
Ahora puedo decir, sufrir amor, lo que se siente
Te sacare 'e mi mente y eso sera de repente

Pero es que tu, chica, con ese pikete
Dices que me olvidaste y en tus ojos veo que mientes
Ahora puedo decir, sufrir amor, lo que se siente
Te sacare 'e mi mente y eso sera de repente

Ay hombre


Es que me niego a perderte
Jamas nunca verte
Me niego a acceptar que lo nuestro ya se acabo

Es que me niego a perderte
Jamas nunca verte
Me niego a acceptar que lo nuestro ya se acabo

Me esta matando la soledad
Duele saber que ya no estas
Quiero pensar que todo esto es mentira
Y que a alguien mas le contestaras
Al llegar la noche, regresaras

Aun podemos intentar, no te alejes de mi vida


Llorando de noche, muriendo de dia, viviendo esta agonia
No puedo entender que ya no seas mia
El circulo se cierra y el dolor me entierra
Que dificil es vivir en esta guerra

Me niego, aunque digas que estoy ciego
Desde que te fuiste, soy un andariego
A todos compromisos, tarde le llego
Distraido, de tu foto no me despego

Si tu eres mi vida, ¿por que me liquidas?
Yo no provoque tu partida
Necesito tu olor, necesito tu calor
Necesito verte encima de mi en ropa interior


Aun quedan tus retratos por cada rincon de la casa
Y el silecnio me habla de ti, es que sobra tanto espacio
Desde que no estas, daria todo lo que hoy me queda por tenerte
Por que vuelvas


Es que me niego a perderte
Jamas nunca verte
Me niego a acceptar que lo nuestro ya se acabo


Es que me niego a perderte
Jamas nunca verte
Me niego a acceptar que lo nuestro ya se acabo


Que lo nuestro ya se acabo

Just another day up inside the jungle
Tryna stop these foes from making me crumble
Find my way through dreaming, don't need nobody
I got my bags packed, ready to take all the power

Olay can't stop me I'm sorry
No way you're stopping my story
It's so crazy, nothing can phase me, follow me baby
And don't think about stoppin'
'Cuz we about to get rah rah rockin'

Don't stop the music, get louder
Come on now feel it
Don't stop till you feel the power
There ain't no ceiling
No time for stressin', just be your best
And you'll have whatever you want
Don't stop the music, get louder
Gimme that feeling hmm yeah

These haters keep hating
But I keep on climbing
I'm parting the seas
While everyone sleeps
I'm ready I'm fighting
I'm hot like wasabi
And I promise that you can be like me
You gotta follow your dreams
And when you hear talking
Don't think about stoppin'

No don't you think about stoppin' (namanana)
'Cuz we about to get rah rah rockin' (namanana)
No don't you think about stoppin' (hey come on)
'Cuz we about to get rah rah rockin'

Don't stop the music, get louder
Come on now feel it
Don't stop till you feel the power
There ain't no ceiling
No time for stressin', just be your best
And you'll have whatever you want
Don't stop the music, get louder
Gimme that feeling

Uh I'm always winning the race
I'm always, I'm always getting first place (hoo)
They can't keep up in this chase
They can't keep, they can't keep up with the pace (namanana)
It's so crazy, nothing can phase me, follow me baby
And don't think about stoppin'
'Cuz we about to get rah rah rockin'

Don't stop the music, get louder

Oh-oh
Uoh-oh-oh
Eh-yeh-yeh, yeh-yeh-yeh, yeh

Cuando empiezas a bailar
No es justo, no es justo
Y lo noto en tu mirar
Te gusto, te gusto

Sonando esta cancion y yo viendote
Si te acercas a mi, no pares
Y si te digo "Esta linda" una y otra vez
Eso te gusta y lo sabes

Cuando empiezas a bailar
No es justo, no es justo (mamacita, eh-yeh)
Y lo noto en tu mirar
Te gusto, te gusto (¡su, dile Z!)

Sonando esta cancion y yo viendote
Si te acercas a mi, no pares
Y si te digo "Esta linda" una y otra vez
Eso te gusta y lo sabes

Sin ti no existe la discoteca (discoteca)
Ya te he dado mucho y poco tu me das (dame mas)
De la fiesta eres la pieza que falta (si, si)
Si pa' pasarla rico solo faltas tu

Dejate llevar
Estas ansiosa, lo puedo notar (toma)
Todas tus ganas las puedo calmar (yeh, yeh)
Si yo soy lo que te hace falta, y aqui solo faltas tu
Dejate llevar (yeeeeh, su)

Sonando esta cancion y yo viendote
Si te acercas a mi, no pares
Y si te digo "Esta linda" una y otra vez
Eso te gusta y lo sabes

Hoy vine a verte otra vez
Yo solo quiero hacerlo otra vez
Y no se lo que tu me hiciste
Me dieron ganas de desvestirte

Hoy sali a verte otra vez
Yo solo quiero hacerlo otra vez
Y no se lo que tu me hiciste
Me dieron ganas de desvestirte (Zion, baby)

Un par de miradas y como si nada
Va pasando el tiempo, se acorta la distancia
De tener tus besos, que mis labios llaman
Empezo en deseo, termino en realidad

Y ahora vente, y es evidente
Que yo te gusto, de lejos se siente
Dejate llevar, que esta bueno el ambiente
Sigueme el plan, que yo lo tengo en mente

Cuando empiezas a bailar
No es justo, no es justo
Y lo noto en tu mirar
Te gusto, te gusto

Sonando esta cancion y yo viendote
Si te acercas a mi, no pares (pares)
Y si te digo "Esta linda" una y otra vez
Eso te gusta y lo sabes

Cuando empiezas a bailar
No es justo, no es justo (eh-yeh)
Y lo noto en tu mirar
Te gusto, te gusto

Sonando esta cancion y yo viendote
Si te acercas a mi, no pares
Y si te digo "Esta linda" una y otra vez
Eso te gusta y lo sabes

---------------------------------------------------
I don't wanna lie, can we be honest?
Right now while you're sitting on my chest
I don't know what I'd do without your comfort
If you really go first, if you really left

I don't know if I would be alive today
With or without you like night and day
Read and repeat every conversation
Being with you, every day's a Saturday
But every Sunday you've got me praying

Don't you ever leave me, don't you ever go
I've seen it on TV, I know how it goes
Even when you're angry, even when I'm cold
Don't you ever leave me, don't leave me alone

Don't leave me a
Ah, ah, loooone
Ah, ah, ha
Ah, ah, loooone
Ah, ah, ha

I don't wanna call and you not answer
And never see your face light up my phone
Never see you singing tiny dancer
Every time my head hurts, every time I'm low

Cause I don't know if I would be alive today
With or without you like night and day
Everything 'bout you uncomplicated
Here with you, every day's a Saturday
But every Sunday, you've got me praying

Don't you ever leave me, don't you ever go
I've seen it on TV, I know how it goes
Even when you're angry, even when I'm cold
Don't you ever leave me, don't leave me alone

Don't leave me a
Ah, ah, loooone
Ah, ah, ha
Ah, ah, loooone
Ah, ah, ha (make me, alo...)

Don't you ever leave me
Don't you ever go
Don't you ever leave me
No

Don't you ever leave me, don't you ever go
I've seen it on TV, I know how it goes
Even when you're angry, even when I'm cold
Don't you ever leave me, don't leave me alone

Don't you ever leave me, don't you ever go
I've seen it on TV, I know how it goes
Even when you're angry, even when I'm cold
Don't you ever leave me, don't leave me alone

Even when you're angry, even when I'm cold
Don't you ever leave me, don't leave me alone
---------------------------------------------------
Saturday nights, blueberry cigarillos
Swishers make my throat hurt
Rolling OCB's on the side for me
Light 'em up and let 'em both burn
Family feuds, say your mom's confused
Off of shit she doesn't wanna learn
But daddy's gone, say he's never home
And wishing only makes it worse

I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep
'Cause they'll only know what you let 'em see

All the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
And all the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do

Saturday nights, light gray Silverado
You drive it 'cause you have to
Stay up working late at a job you hate
Fix your makeup in a dirty bathroom
No more love, in and out of clubs
Knowing what you gotta do
You've got plans wrapped in rubber bands
And that's the only thing you'll never lose

I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep
'Cause they'll only know what you let 'em see

All the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
And all the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do

'Cause I care, I care about you
There's nowhere I'd rather be
Than right here around you
I care, care about you
There's nowhere I'd rather be

All the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care about you
Nowhere like I do
All the things that I know
That your parents don't
Don't care about you
Nowhere like I
Nowhere like I do (Do, do, do)
Nowhere like I do (Do, do, do)
Nowhere like I do (Do, do, do)
Nowhere like I do (Do, do, do)

(Weezy, Weezy, Weezy, Weezy
Weezy, Weezy, Weezy, Weezy)
I see, thank you man, thank you
Y'all know his name
Ayo, Mack, let the beat drop
Ladies and gentlemen, C5, Wayne time
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Zone, zone, zone, zone, zone
Let me see your shoulders work
I mean, I don't know what y'all came here to do, but, uh
If you ain't got a lighter, what the fuck you smoking for?
We hot! (Haaa)

What the fuck, though? Where the love go?
Five, four, three, two, I let one go
Bow! Get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro
Aimin' at your head like a buffalo
You a roughneck, I'm a cutthroat
You're a tough guy, that's enough jokes
Then the sun die, the night is young though
The diamonds still shine in the rough, ho
What the fuck though? Where the love go?
Five, four, three, two, where the ones go?
It's a shit show, put you front row
Talkin' shit, bro? Let your tongue show
Money over bitches, and above hoes
That is still my favorite love quote
Put the gun inside, what the fuck for?
I sleep with the gun, and she don't snore
What the fuck, yo? Where the love go?
Trade the ski mask for the muzzle
It's a blood bath, where the suds go?
It's a Swizz beat, there the drums go
If she's iffy, there the drugs go
If she sip lean, double-cup toast
I got a duffle full of hundos
There the love go, where's the uproar?

What the fuck though? Where the love go?
Five, four, three, two, I let one go
Bow! Get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro
Aimin' at your head like a buffalo
What the fuck though? Where the love go?
Five, four, three, two, I let one go
Bow! Get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro
Aimin' at your head like a buffalo

Get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro
I come out the scuffle without a scuff, whoa
Puff, puff, bro; I don't huff though
Yellow diamonds up close, catch a sunstroke
At your front door with a gun stowed
"Knock, knock. Who's there?" is how it won't go
This the jungle, so have the utmost
For the nutzos, and we nuts, so
What the fuck, bro? It's where I'm from, bro
We grow up fast, we roll up slow
We throw up gang signs, she throw up dope
Dreadlock hang down like you dun know
Put the green in the bag like a lawnmower
Hair trigger pulled back like a cornrow
Extra clip in the stash like a console
Listenin' to Bono, you listen to Donald
What the fuck, bro? Where the love go?
Swizzy, he the chef, I like my lunch gross
Just look up, bro, there the Scuds go
I see the shovel, but where did bruh go?
Hmm, to the unknown
Only way he comin' back is through his unborns
If you see what's in my bag, think I'm a drug lord
It's empty when I give it back, now where's the uproar?

What the fuck though? Where the love go?
Five, four, three, two, I let one go
Bow! Get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro
Aimin' at your head like a buffalo
What the fuck though? Where the love go?
Five, four, three, two, I let one go
Bow! Get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro
Aimin' at your head like a buffalo

Gold on her body like Wonder Woman
Fly in that bitch, I'm Wonder Man


Slick back, lil' bitch, like a perm

Can't take the dick, she gon' squirt
Fuckin' that bitch 'til she hurt

Smokin' on all of this herb

All it'd take is one flight
We'd be in the same time zone
Looking through your timeline
Seeing all the rainbows, I
I got an idea
And I know that it sounds crazy
I just wanna see ya
All I gotta ask

Do you got plans tonight?
I'm a couple hundred miles from Japan, and I
I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight
'Cause I-I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Oh, oh

I can't seem to get you off my mind
(Let's get lost tonight)
(Let's get lost tonight)
(Baby, you and)
I can't seem to get you off my mind

I could feel the tension
We could cut it with a knife
I know it's more than just a friendship
I can hear you think I'm right, yeah
Do I gotta convince you?
That you shouldn't fall asleep?
It'll only be a couple hours
And I'm about to leave

Do you got plans tonight?
I'm a couple hundred miles from Japan, and I
I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight
'Cause I-I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Oh, oh

I can't seem to get you off my mind
(Let's get lost tonight)
(Let's get lost tonight)
(Baby, you and)
I can't seem to get you off my mind

Do you got plans tonight?
I'm a couple hundred miles from Japan, and I
I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight
'Cause I-I-I can't get you off my mind
I can't get you off my mind
Do you got plans tonight, baby?
I was hoping I could get lost in your paradise
The only thing I'm thinking 'bout is you and I
And I-I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
I can't seem to get you off my mind, yeah

(Let's get lost tonight)
(Let's get lost tonight)
(Baby, you and)
I can't seem to get you off my mind
(Let's get lost tonight)
(Let's get lost tonight, oh)

---------------------------------------------------
Ayy, wild things you're doin' at night
Trips to wherever feels right
Doin' it all just to feel things
Drinking's enough of a vice
Drugs just aren't suiting you right
You were just fine as a real thing, thing

You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
I don't know what you're sayin'
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me

All of a sudden you say you don't want me no more
All of a sudden you say that I closed the door

It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me what you say
It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me what you say

I can't recover from our last conversation
You called me weak
And you tested my manhood as we yelled at each other
You wanted me to gon' put my hands on you
Just to show you I love you
You know I can't jeopardize both our reputations
Despite what you say
Despite what you choose to do with yourself this summer
You're actin' out, you know you love to see me down
Stressin' over somethin' (stressin' over somethin')

You, you, you, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
I don't know what you're sayin'
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me

All of a sudden you say you don't want me no more
All of a sudden you say that I closed the door

It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me what you say
It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me what you say

Girl, your love, you think you broke it
I'm leavin' you today, you broke my heart
Girl, your love, you think you broke it
I'm leavin' you today, you broke my heart
---------------------------------------------------
Yeah (Illa, Illa, Illa)
Yo I'm just gonna write down my first thoughts and see where this takes me, 'cause I feel like I wanna punch the world in the fuckin' face right now

Yeah, let me explain just how to make greatness
Straight out the gate, I'm 'bout to break it down
Ain't no mistakes allowed, but make no mistake I'm 'bout
To rape the alphabet, I may raise some brows
If I press the issue just to get the anger out (brrr)
Full magazine could take Staples out
Savage, but ain't thinkin' 'bout no bank account
But, bitch, I'm off the chain like Kala Brown

Motherfucker, shut the fuck up when I'm talkin', lil' bitch
I'm sorry, wait, what's your talent?
Oh, critiquin' my talent?
Oh, bitch, I don't know who the fuck y'all are
To give a sub-par bar, or even have an opinion of you
You mention me, millions of views, attention in news
I mention you, lose-lose for me, win-win for you
Billions of views, your ten cents are two
Skim through the music to give shit reviews
To get clicks, but, bitch, you just lit the fuse
Don't get misconstrued, business as us'
Shit-list renewed so get shit to do
Or get dissed 'cause I just don't get what the fuck half the shit is that you're listenin' t-to
Do you have any idea how much I hate this choppy flow
Everyone copies though? Probably no
Get this fuckin' audio out my Audi yo, adios
I can see why people like Lil Yachty, but not me though
Not even dissin', it just ain't for me
All I am simply is just an MC
Maybe "Stan" just isn't your cup of tea
(Get it)
Maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean
Maybe I need to stir up shit
Preferably shake the world up if it were up to me
Paul wants me to chill, y'all want me to ill
I should eat a pill, probably I will
Old me killed the new me, watch him bleed to death
I breathe on the mirror, I don't see my breath
Possibly I'm dead, I must be possessed
Like an evil spell, I'm E-V-I-L (evil, but spelled)

Jam a Crest Whitestrip in the tip of my dick with an ice pick
Stick it in a vice grip, hang it on a spike fence
Bang it with a pipe wrench
While I take my ballsack and flick it like a light switch
Like Vice President Mike Pence
Back up on my shit in a sidekick as I lay it on a spike strip

These are things that I'd rather do than hear you on a mic
Since nine-tenths of your rhyme is about ice and
Jesus Christ, man, how many times is someone gonna fuck on my bitch?
(Fuck my side chick!)

You won't ever see Em icy, but as cold as I get on the M-I-C
I polarize shit so the Thames might freeze
And your skull might split like I bashed you upside it
Bitch, I got the club on smash like a nightstick (yeah)

Turn down for what? I ain't loud enough
Nah, turn the Valium up! (Illa, Illa, Illa)
'Cause I don't know how I'm gonna get your mouths to shut
Now, when it doesn't matter what caliber I spit at
I'll bet a hundred thousand bucks
You'll turn around and just be like, "Man, how the fuck sourpuss gonna get mad just 'cause his album sucks?
And now he wants to take it out on us"
(Ooh-ooh)

But last week, an ex-fan mailed me a copy
Of The Mathers LP to tell me to study
It'll help me get back to myself and she'll love me (ooh-ooh)
I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that
I'd just be like everyone else in the fucking industry
Especially an effing Recovery clone of me (NFing)

So finger-bang, chicken wang, MGK, Igg' Azae'
Lil Pump, Lil Xan imitate Lil Wayne
I should aim at everybody in the game, pick a name
I'm fed up with being humble
And rumor is I'm hungry, I'm sure you heard bumblings
I heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach
I heard your mumblin' but it's jumbled in mumbo-jumbo
The era that I'm from will pummel you
That's what it's comin' to
What the fuck you're gonna do when you run into it?
I'm gonna crumble you and I'll take a number two
And dump on you if you ain't Joyner
If you ain't Kendrick or Cole or Sean then you're a goner
I'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it
I guess when you walk into BK you expect a Whopper
You can order a Quarter Pounder when you go to McDonald's
But if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse you better go get Revival
But y'all are acting like I tried to serve you up a slider
Maybe the vocals should have been auto-tuned
And you would have bought it
But sayin' I no longer got it
'Cause you missed a line and never caught it
'Cause it went over your head, because you're too stupid to get it
'Cause you're mentally retarded, but pretend to be the smartest
With your expertise and knowledge, but you'll never be an artist
And I'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless
What I'll never be is flawless, all I'll ever be is honest (Illa, Illa, Illa)
Even when I'm gone they're gonna say I brought it
Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic
With a bottle full of malt liquor
But I couldn't bottle this shit any longer
The fact that I know that I'ma hit my bottom
If I don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet
I don't see why y'all even started with me
I get in beefs, my enemies die
I don't cease fire 'til at least all are deceased
I'm east side, never be caught slippin'
Now you see why I don't sleep
Not even a wink, I don't blink
I don't doze off, I don't even nod to the beats
I don't even close my fuckin' eyes when I sneeze

"Aw, man! That BET cypher was weak, it was garbage
The Thing ain't even orange—oh my God, that's a reach!"
Shout to all my colorblind people, each and every one of y'all
If you call a fire engine green, aquamarine
Or you think water is pink
"Dawg, that's a date," "Looks like an olive to me"
"Look, there's an apple!" "No it's not, it's a peach!"

So finger-bang, Pootie Tang
Burger King, Gucci Gang, dookie, dang
Charlamagne gonna hate anyway
Doesn't matter what I say
Give me Donkey of the Day
What a way for 2018 to get underway
But I'm gonna say everything that I wanna say
Welcome to the slaughterhouse, bitch! (yeah)
Invite them in like a One A Day
I'm not done (preach)
'Cause I feel like the beast of burden
That line in the sand, was it even worth it?
'Cause the way I see people turning's
Makin' it seem worthless
It's startin' to defeat the purpose
I'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds
And I was just tryin' to do the right thing, but word
Has the court of public opinion reached a verdict
Or still yet to be determined?
'Cause I'm determined to be me, critiqued or worshiped
But if I could go back I'd at least reword it
And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent
Sold the dream to that he's deserted

But I think it's workin'
These verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous
And he's too scurred to answer me with words
'Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered
But I know at least he's heard it
'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service
To meet in person to see if I really think of hurtin' him
Or ask if I'm linked to terrorists
I said, "Only when it comes to ink and lyricists"
But my beef is more media journalists
(Hold up, hold up, hold up...)
I said my beef is more meaty, a journalist
Can get a mouthful of flesh
And, yes, I mean eating a penis
'Cause they been pannin' my album to death
So I been givin' the media fingers
Don't wanna turn this to a counseling sesh
But they been puttin' me through the ringer
So, I ain't ironin' shit out with the press
But I just took this beat to the cleaners
---------------------------------------------------
No aguanto mas un segundo sin verte
Responde ya, que esto es de vida o muerte
Ya me conoces, nunca fui tan fuerte
Tu dejaste nuestro amor en el olvido
Esta relacion en puntos suspensivos
Dime si valio la pena, dime si valio la pena

Pasaran mas de mil anos y yo no te olvido
No me lo pidas, no sere tu amigo
Estar contigo es mi destino
Pasaran mas de mil anos y yo no te olvido
No me lo pidas, no sere tu amigo

Entregarte tanto fue mi debilidad
Y tus besos ahora son mi necesidad
Ahora solo me acompana la soledad
Contigo siento que yo pierdo mi dignidad (yeah)
Tuyo, si es que no te tengo y yo me siento tuyo
Y aun asi yo me sigo preguntando
Si yo no fui lo suficiente para ti
No fui lo suficiente para ti
Tuyo, si es que no te tengo y yo me siento tuyo
Y aun asi yo me sigo preguntando
Si yo no fui lo suficiente para ti

Pasaran mas de mil anos y yo no te olvido
No me lo pidas, no sere tu amigo
Estar contigo es mi destino
Pasaran mas de mil anos y yo no te olvido

Tu dejaste nuestro amor en el olvido
Esta relacion en puntos suspensivos
Dime si valio la pena, dime si valio la pena
No aguanto mas un segundo sin verte

Soy culpable, yo fui el que te dane (te dane)
No pense la mujer que perdia (ah-ah)

Y me hace tanta falta
Un beso tuyo
Que me llames borracha
Pa' que te de bien duro (oh)

Y me hace tanta falta
Un beso tuyo
Hacertelo bien rico
Bebe deja el orgullo (oh-oh-oh)

Me hacen falta tus besos mojados
Ojala pudiera devolver el pasado
Cuando ibamos pa'l cine y despues a comer helado
No se que es pero hay algo que nos mantiene atados, baby
A mi me encanta el sabor de tus labios
Todos cometen errores, hasta el hombre mas sabio
Tu eres la baby, por ninguna a ti te cambio
Tu eres real las otras buscan algo a cambio
Baby, quisiera pegarme en la radio
Para que me escuches a diario
Te trate de olvidar pero al contrario
Mami te volviste algo necesario

Y me hace tanta falta
Un beso tuyo
Que me llames borracha
Pa' que te de bien duro

Y me hace tanta falta
Un beso tuyo
Hacertelo bien rico
Bebe deja el orgullo

Vente, esto cada dia se hace mas fuerte
De un dia pa' otro cambio mi suerte
No quiero que venga la siguiente (ye-eh-eh)
Nada me divierte
Mas que yo ninguno va a quererte
Las mananas quiero ser quien te despierte
Baby yo quiero cogerte... de la mano (de la mano)
Baby yo solo quiero con vos (vos)
Si te tengo a ti no me hace falta dos (dos)
Me enamore, no se ni como sucedio (-dio)
Tu eres la mujer que tanto le pedi a Dios

Y me hace tanta falta
Un beso tuyo
Que me llames borracha
Pa' que te de bien duro

Y me hace tanta falta
Un beso tuyo
Hacertelo bien rico
Bebe deja el orgullo (oh-oh-oh)

Yeah, yeah, mmm

Candy paint with the white on top
Lambo doors are the oo-op drop
If you busy plotting on what I got
Kick in your door, That's SWAT, you thot
Hundred thousand dollars on the table top
Half price my whip, same price my watch
Got no jumper but I ball a lot
Bitch, I'm young Stoney, I do what I want
Candy paint with the white on top (skrrt)
Lambo doors are the oo-op drop (drop)
If you busy plotting on what I got
Kick in your door, that's SWAT, you thot (pop)
Hundred thousand dollars on the table top
Half price my whip, same price my watch (bling)
Got no jumper but I ball a lot (swish)
Bitch, I'm young Stoney, I do what I want

Didn't know that was your girl when she gave me top (yuh)
Kicked her out the Rolls said, "Thanks a lot"
Goddamn I love paper like I'm Michael Scott (yeah)
I can do things that your man cannot (yeah)
Slide boy comin' down, damn, I'm hot (hot)
Everybody say that I gotta be stopped (stopped)
Even though my final form ain't unlocked (locked)
I'm so ahead of you motherfuckers
How you comprehend what you ain't understanding?
Count a hundred bands and I watch it vanish
Diamonds going crazy like they on the dance floor
Got a lot of ass, nothing I can't handle

Flavor lasts forever, you should try a sample (God damn)
Baby, I'm the boss like I'm Tony Danza (Tony Danza)
Everybody trying to tell me what I stand for
But you don't fucking know me, homie, you don't want war (aye)

Candy paint with the white on top
Lambo doors are the oo-op drop
If you busy plotting on what I got
Kick in your door, that's SWAT, you thot
Hundred thousand dollars on the table top
Half price my whip, same price my watch
Got no jumper but I ball a lot (hey, hey)
Bitch, I'm young Stoney, I do what I want (hey, hey)
Candy paint with the white on top (yeah)
Lambo doors are the oo-op drop (drop, drop)
If you busy plotting on what I got
Kick in your door, that's SWAT, you thot (pop, pop, pop, pop)
Hundred thousand dollars on the table top
Half price my whip, same price my watch (yeah)
Got no jumper but I ball a lot (swish)
Bitch, I'm young Stoney, I do what I want

I've been rolling twenty ash, hit the road (wooh)
Hit the switch up the suicide doors (damn)
We already know you vanished though (ooh)
Hit my momma when I ride in that, oh
All these motherfuckers so false with me (yah)
If your money funny, don't talk to me (nah)
I know there ain't shit that you could offer me (no)
Take a second if you think about crossing me

It lasts forever, you should try a sample (God damn)
Baby, I'm the boss like I'm Tony Danza (Tony Danza)
Everybody trying to tell me what I stand for (what I stand for)
But you don't fucking know me, homie, you don't want war (you don't want war)

You can pretend you don't miss me (Me)
You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me (Me)
Oh, what a shame, I'm not there

You can pretend you don't miss me (Me)
You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me (Me)
Oh, what a shame, I'm not there

What is it you want?
You can lie, but I know that you're not fine (Don't, all you)
Every time you talk
It's all 'bout me, but you swear I'm not on your mind (Don't)

You can pretend you don't miss me (All you, me)
You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me (Me)
Oh, what a shame, I'm not there

Everybody knows
You and I are suicidal stolen art (Don't, all you)
Pretty mama sews
Stitches into all your bitches' broken hearts (Don't)

You can pretend you don't miss me (All you, me)
You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me (Me)
Oh, what a shame, I'm not there

Somebody new is gonna comfort you
Like you want me to
Somebody new is gonna comfort me
Like you never do

Every now and then, it hits me
That I'm the one that got away
But I guess being lonely fits me
And you were made for begging, "Stay"

Soy la que controla
Pero dale, vamos
Paso a paso que me va elevando el calor
Tu pantalon va guayando
Y ya te tengo pensando

I'll tell you a story before it tells itself
I lay out all my reasons, you say that I need help
We all got expectations, and sometimes they go wrong
But no one listens to me, so I put it in this song

They tell me think with my head, not that thing in my chest
They got their hands at my neck this time
But you're the one that I want, if that's really so wrong
Then they don't know what this feeling is like

And I say yeah-eah
Yeah-eah-eah-eah
Yeah-eah
Yeah-eah-eah-eah
And I say yeah-eah
Yeah-eah-eah-eah
Yeah-eah
Yeah-eah-eah-eah

I'll tell them a story, they'll sit and nod their heads
I tell you all my secrets, and you tell all your friends
Hold on to your opinions, and stand by what you say (stand by what you say)
In the end, it's my decision, so it's my fault when it ends

They tell me think with my head, not that thing in my chest
They got their hands at my neck this time
But you're the one that I want, if that's really so wrong
Then they don't know what this feeling is like

And I say yeah-eah
Yeah-eah-eah-eah
Yeah-eah
Yeah-eah-eah-eah
And I say yeah-eah

My friends say no-o, no-o-o
Then they don't know
No-o, no-o-o
Yeah, no-o, no-o-o

Al party llegamos en convertible
Si quieres perreo, solo dime
Y hare que nuestros pasos rimen

Queria saber quien era yo

Vamonos pa' casa y resolvemos

We found each other
I helped you out of a broken place
You gave me comfort
But falling for you was my mistake

I put you on top, I put you on top
I claimed you so proud and openly
And when times were rough, when times were rough
I made sure I held you close to me

So call out my name (call out my name)
Call out my name when I kiss you so gently
I want you to stay (want you to stay)
I want you to stay, even though you don't want me
Girl, why can't you wait? (Why can't you wait, baby?)
Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of love?
Won't you call out my name? (Call out my name)
Girl, call out my name, and I'll be on my way and
I'll be on my

I said I didn't feel nothing, baby, but I lied
I almost cut a piece of myself for your life
Guess I was just another pit stop
'Til you made up your mind
You just wasted my time

You were on top, I put you on top
I claimed you so proud and openly, babe
And when times were rough, when times were rough
I made sure I held you close to me!

So call out my name (call out my name, baby)
So call out my name when I kiss you
So gently, oh, I want you to stay (I want you to stay)
I want you to stay even though you don't want me
Girl, why can't you wait? (Girl, why can't you wait 'til I?)
Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of loving?
Babe, call out my name (say call out my name, baby)
Girl, call out my name, and I'll be on my way
And I'll be on my

On my way, on my way
On my way, on my way, ooh
On my way, on my way, on my way
On my way, on my way, on my way
(On my)
---------------------------------------------------
We were golden, we were fire, we were magic
Yeah, and they all knew our names all over town
We had it made in the middle of the madness
We were neon in a grey crowd
Yeah, we wrote our own story
Full of blood, sweat, and heartbeats
We didn't do it for the fame or the glory
But we went down in history

Yeah, we were legends
Loving you baby, it was heaven
What everyone wondered, we never questioned
Closed our eyes and took on the world together
Do you remember?
We were crazy, tragic and epic, and so amazing
I'll always wear the crown that you gave me
We will always stay lost in forever, and they'll remember
We were legends

Like we were written down in permanent marker
Not even the brightest sun could ever fade
Come whichever, hell or high water
It was always me and you either way
Hey, we wrote our own story
Full of blood, sweat, and heartbeats
We didn't do it for the fame or the glory
We just did it for you and me

And that's why we were legends
Loving you baby, it was heaven
What everyone wondered, we never questioned
Closed our eyes and took on the world together
Do you remember?
We were crazy, tragic and epic, and so amazing
I'll always wear the crown that you gave me
We will always stay lost in forever, and they'll remember
We were legends

We were legends
Loving you baby, it was heaven
What everyone wondered, we never questioned
Closed our eyes and took on the world together
Do you remember, baby?
We were crazy, tragic and epic, and so amazing
I'll always wear the crown that you gave me
We will always stay lost in forever, and they'll remember
We were legends

Yeah, we were legends
And we wrote our own story

I've gotta keep the calm before the storm
I don't want less, I don't want more
Must bar the windows and the doors
To keep me safe, to keep me warm

Yeah my life is what I'm fighting for
Can't part the sea, can't reach the shore
And my voice becomes the driving force
I won't let this pull me overboard

God, keep my head above water
Don't let me drown, it gets harder
I'll meet you there at the altar
As I fall down to my knees
Don't let me drown, drown, drown
Don't let me, don't let me, don't let me drown

So pull me up from down below
'Cause I'm underneath the undertow
Come dry me off and hold me close
I need you now I need you most

God, keep my head above water
Don't let me drown, it gets harder
I'll meet you there at the altar
As I fall down to my knees
Don't let me drown, drown, drown
(Don't let me, don't let me, don't let me drown)
Don't let me drown, drown, drown
And keep my head above water
(Don't let me, don't let me, don't let me drown)
Above water

And I can't see in the stormy weather
I can't seem to keep it all together
And I can't swim the ocean like this forever
And I can't breathe

God, keep my head above water
I lose my breath at the bottom
Come rescue me, I'll be waiting
I'm too young to fall asleep

So God, keep my head above water
Don't let me drown, it gets harder
I'll meet you there at the altar
As I fall down to my knees

Don't let me drown
Don't let me drown
(Don't let me, don't let me, don't let me drown)
Don't let me drown
And keep my head above water
(Don't let me, don't let me, don't let me drown)
Above water

You had one job!

Woke up on the West side
Listening to Beach House, taking my time
She's just my type
Dark hair wavin' out the passenger side
Then I start to think
As she pulls me on the bathroom floor
This is my type of thing
Yeah, yeah

Oh, darling of mine, where have you been?
I feel so alive with you in my bed
Oh, darling of mine, please don't let go
Just tell me you feel this, tell me you know
Oh, darling of mine

Oh, darling of mine

On a train through Japan
I keep her real close 'cause she knows who I am
Red pill in my hand
Paranoid cutie with a dark past and
It's that type of thing
When she feels like the girl next door
This is my type of thing
Yeah, yeah

Oh, darling of mine
Where have you been?
I feel so alive
With you in my bed
Oh, darling of mine
Please don't let go
Just tell me you feel this
Tell me you know
Oh, darling of mine

Oh, darling of mine
Where have you been?
Where have you been?
Where have you been?
Where have you been?

And then I start to think as I lift her on the sink
That I've been here before
It's a certain type of fling, she gets bored of everything
Not the type you can ignore
Yeah, I just wanna taste as she grabs me by the waist
As she closes the door
She's taking what she wants, baby, you can have it all

Oh, darling of mine
Where have you been? (Where have you been?)
I feel so alive
With you in my bed (You in my bed)
Oh, darling of mine
Please don't let go (Please don't let go)
Just tell me you feel this
Tell me you know
Oh, darling of mine

Yeah-eah
Yeah-eah
Yeah-eah
Where have you been?
Where have you been?
Where have you been?
Where have you been?
Oh, darling of mine
---------------------------------------------------
There goes my heart beating
Cause you are the reason
I'm losing my sleep
Please come back now

There goes my mind racing
And you are the reason
That I'm still breathing
I'm hopeless now

I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, cause I need you to see
That you are the reason

There goes my hands shaking
And you are the reason
My heart keeps bleeding
I need you now

If I could turn back the clock
I'd make sure the light defeated the dark
I'd spend every hour, of every day
Keeping you safe

And I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, cause I need you to see
That you are the reason

I don't wanna fight no more
I don't wanna hide no more
I don't wanna cry no more
Come back I need you to hold me
(You are the reason)
Come a little closer now
Just a little closer now
Come a little closer
I need you to hold me tonight

I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Cause I need you to see
That you are the reason

Ya me dijeron (oh-oh-oh-oh)
Que tu a mi me quieres ver
Ya tu amiga me lo confeso
Que al igual que yo, tu me quieres comer
Ya me dijeron
Que no eres feliz con el
No hay nada de malo, ven, pasala bien
Dime cuando nos vamos a ver

Dejame sentirte, bebe
Como en el telefono tu me decias
Que yo era tu fantasia
Y por mi morias

Dejame sentirte, bebe
Como en el telefono tu me decias
Que yo era tu fantasia

Yo se que tu quieres recordar
Como es que lo haciamos, bien rico, sin parar
Quiero volver a acariciar
A ese cuerpesito que me hace pecar

Bebe, dejame sentir tu calor
En mi cuarto, a solas la pasamos mejor
No se si es placer, o sufrimiento o dolor
Yo se que me gusta que me ignores, mi amor
Tu eres mia

Dejame sentir tu calor
En mi cuarto, a solas la pasamos mejor

Ah, ah
I'm the boy in your other phone
Lighting up inside your drawer at home all alone
Pushing forty in the friend zone
We talk and then you walk away every day

Ooh, you don't think twice 'bout me
And maybe you're right to doubt me, but

But if you give me just one night
You're gonna see me in a new light
Yeah, if you give me just one night
To meet you underneath the moonlight

Oh, I wanna take two, I wanna break through
I wanna know the real thing about you
So I can see you in a new light

Take a ride up to Malibu
I just wanna sit and look at you, look at you
What would it matter if your friends knew?
Who cares what other people say anyway?

Oh, we can go far from here
And make a new world together, babe

'Cause if you give me just one night
You're gonna see me in a new light
Yeah, if you give me just one night
To meet you underneath the moonlight

Oh, I wanna take two, I wanna break through
I wanna know the real thing about you
So I can see you in a new light

Ay, ay
Ay, ay
Ay, ay
Ay, ay
Ay, ay

Ah

Yeah, if you give me just one night
You're gonna see me in a new light
Yeah, if you give me just one night
To meet you underneath the moonlight

What do I do with all this, what do I do with all this
Love that's running through my veins for you?
What do I do with all this, what do I do with all this
Love that's running through my veins for you?

What do I do with all this, what do I do with all this
Love that's running through my veins for you?
What do I do with all this, what do I do with all this, ooh

All you wanted was attention


You know just what I'm needing
And you refuse to see it
I guess sometimes I wonder
Is this what you wanted
There's not much I could say right now
If there's a price I could pay right now, ooh
How much for us to run away?
You're all I need to lead the way

Where are we now?
And where are we going?
You can't help me now
Your lies are colliding

All you wanted was attention
All you wanted was attention
All you wanted was attention
All you wanted was attention


I was there last time
I resist to let go
Everything used to be real
Seems like it fading
Your heartbeat is rising

I'mma still love you
Never let you go
We keep it there now
There's not much I could say right now
If we keep on fighting like this
We are in it, bouf, we are J Law
How much for us to run away?
Nah, yeah baby
Nat, hey baby now play 'round
We don't wanna leave
We just wanna stay now


Where are we now?
And where are we going?
You can't help me now
Your lies are colliding

All you wanted was attention
All you wanted was attention
All you wanted was attention

Ah, o-oh, oh, oh
(This-this is the remix)
Dices que de mi ya te olvidaste
Y de tu mente borraste
Cuando yo te hacia pom pom pom pom
Pom pom pom pom
Piensas que yo me quede tranquila
Y los tengo haciendo fila
Mientras que tu inventas dar pom pom pom

Mi cama suena y suena
Mi cama suena y suena
N-I-C-K


Mami, tu dan ganas de comer, eh
Porque tu si que lo sabes hacer, eh
Moviendo tu cuerpo como es, eh
Dame esa boquita pa' moder
Ya te tengo arrecha, y yo como un flecha
Siempre que te toco, te prendes como una mecha
Yo no se por que tu tienes la mejor cosecha
Baby, dime cuando, solamente pon la fecha

Lo hacemos por aqui, o lo hacemos por alla
No importa donde sea, mami
Tu escoge el lugar
Yo tengo la cuchilla pa' cortar la torta
No es tu cumpleanos pero eso no importa
Lo hacemos por aqui, o lo hacemos por alla
No importa donde sea, mami
Tu escoge el lugar
Yo tengo la cuchilla pa' cortar la torta
No es tu cumpleanos pero, pero, pero


Mi cama suena y suena
Mi cama suena y suena

Me dicen la reina del flow por mi actitud de hielo
Algunas quieren ser yo, pero no les dio
Para que mentir si no, no
Tu te quedaste solo
Y ahora tengo a J Balvin y Nicky detras
Y yo les digo que no, no


Me gusta como tu cama suena
Cuando mis ganas no frenan
Manejando tus curvas pa' ver donde me llevan
'Tas haciendo mucho ruido
Cuida'o que los vecinos se enteran

Como la puse (la puse), me seduce (seduce)
No me he olvida'o, aunque eso es lo que escuche
Pa' que pienses en mi, baby, hasta cuando te duches
Suena y suena y la abri como a un estuche (dice)
Como la puse (puse), me seduce (seduce)
No me he olvidado, aunque eso es lo que escuche
Pa' que pienses en mi, baby, hasta cuando te duches
Y me culpes porque tu cama suena y suena


Mi cama suena y suena
Mi cama suena y suena

Dices que de mi ya te olvidaste
Y de tu mente borraste
Cuando yo te hacia pom pom pom pom

(This is the remix)

Mi cama suena y suena
Mi cama suena y suena


J Balvin
Karol G
Nicky Jam

Man, fuck all y'all (Just come wit' me)
Everything I do is for us only (Yeah, yeah)
Only us, none of y'all other niggas (I know none of y'all can't tell)
It's on God
(I'm in London, got my beat from London)

Ayy, ayy, I'm drippin' again
The way that I drip this shit should be a sin
Ayy, ayy, divorce all my friends
I'm not a Migo, 'bout to trap out the Benz
Ayy, they told me don't spend
I went got the racks and I did it again
Ayy, I think she a twin
Plus she got red calamari skin
Ayy, you don't got no wins
You should grab something white and just throw it on in
I went to school, got suspended
I told her I want some head, bobby pin
If the lil... don't got class, yeah, we call it truancy
I ain't had no money to spend
I got my first check and went paid off my rent


I poured a four from the clouds down
And my head floating in bliss (Goddamn)
I'm on the phone with big bro now (Damn)
He told me keep Benz on the race (Goddamn)
Until you see it like this, I promise man you'd never think it exists
Straight out a jet to the crib, I'm quick with the switch
Man we never miss, okay (God)
'Bout to turn up in the club, man, back the fuck up
We ain't takin' no pictures
See all the wings in the front, it's us
We had to triple the digits
See all those sexy mamas blowing kisses, man
We had to grant all they wishes (We grants)
Casamigos got me spinnin'
But I want some spendin' some out wit' some dealers
Let's go (Goddamn)


I'm rocking Dior Sauvage (Damn)
I'm higher than Scotty, they calling me Pippen (God)
I got some Cartier vision, it costs me six thousand
I'm watchin' these women
Money's the reason I'm sinning
Money's the reason I gotta take Ritalin
You niggas don't care 'bout women
Just shut the fuck up, yeah I'm taking care plenty
I put Chanel on a belt buckle, of when my price is half off
I keep a stick for my cover, got way more girls than Hugh Hefner
Got the same name as the butler
But more money than Ashley and her mother
Got a backwood full of sherbert, I'm 'bout to smoke like a murder

Ayy, ayy, I'm dripping again
The way that I drip this shit should be a sin
Ayy, ayy, divorce all my friends
I'm not a Migo, 'bout to trap out the Benz
Ayy, they told me don't spend
I went got the racks and I did it again
Ayy, I think she a twin
Plus she got red calamari skin
Ayy, you don't got no wins
You should grab something white and just throw it on in
I went to school, got suspended
I told her I want some head, bobby pin
If the lil... don't got class, yeah, we call it truancy
I ain't had no money to spend
I got my first check and went paid off my rent


Ooh, hop out the back of the turn up
Avoid all the cameras, I did it on purpose
She tryna act like she perfect
I see all the masks that you leave on the surface
She made me write all my verses in cursive
She need all them purses at Hermes
That's like 25 racks and we always on a roll
Man, we always working, let's go


Ay, let me pour up some Act, got some brand new graffiti
It's going down my back
I got Chanel slippers, Gucci pennies, baby, girl you can pick
Rocking Giuseppe Zanotti's a night
I spent half a million designer on kits
I got Chanel slippers, Gucci pennies, baby girl you can pick
I got so high, went off the equator, I feel like Buzz Lightyear
I met a broad, skinny like nails, and I was richer than ice cream
I had to grind without a rail, now all my cars got Nitron
Straight to Dubai, I feel like the mail, I was on a Global Express

I had to grind without a rail, now all my cars got Nitron
Straight to Dubai, I feel like the mail, I was on a Global Express
I'm in London, got my beat from London

Dime si me quieres o no
Dime si lo quieres o no

We play Epa Epa Wei, Epa Epa Wei
Wei, Wei
Epa Epa Wei, Epa Epa Wei
Wei, Wei

See in your eyes playing with fire
But we can take it, oh we can take it
And I realized the feeling is alive
We shouldn’t break it, oh we shouldn’t break it

She’s been like Epa Epa Wei, Epa Epa Wei
Oh Epa Epa Wei, Epa Epa Wei
I can’t take it anymore all this back and forth
Meet me by the door, now I want you for sure

We play Epa Epa Wei, Epa Epa Wei

Run away run away
Can I bury my head please
In a beach from your magazines
That you toss on your floor
If I stay, could we lay
and forget about all of this
In your bed, is that selfish
if I don't talk anymore?

We're two halves of a broken heart
Beating differently
We come together to fall apart

I never listen, listen lately
It's always black and white
She never listen, listen lady
We're like the day and night
She never satisfied
I wanna feel alive, when we collide
You know we live in black and white

I'm afraid, I'm afraid
we've been running in circles
And isn't it hurtful
to keep playing this game?
Is there a way to escape
looking out of your window
At the moon from your pillow
We were so cliche

We're two halves of a broken heart
Locked in symmetry
When we're together, we fall apart

I never listen, listen lately
It's always black and white
She never listen, listen lady
We're like the day and night
She never satisfied
I wanna feel alive, when we collide
You know we live in black and white

There was a time
We bathed in colored lights
How did it ever happen?
Where did we go wrong?
Were we slowly fading
fading all along?

I never listen, listen lately
It's always black and white
She never listen, listen lady
We're like the day and night
She never satisfied
I wanna feel alive, when we collide
You know we live, know we live

I never listen, listen lately
It's always black and white
She never listen, listen lady
We're like the day and night
She never satisfied
I wanna feel alive, when we collide
You know we live in black and white

Made a promise I won't use you
Play my cards right, I won't lose you
Got 'em tuned in like I'm YouTube
Got somethin' on me like it's voodoo
I'll go nuts for you, go cuckoo, lose my cool and all
And I know that shit was wrong, I shouldn't've did what I did

Just wipe your eyes and stop this cryin'
I told the truth, that I'd been lyin'
I gave you racks, I tried to buy in
I even did the unthinkable, and I'm sorry for what I did to you
Take me back, if I was you and I did what I did
I probably would, I probably wouldn't

Stuck in my glory days

(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...)
Sueno un verano que se hiciera eterno
Desde el momento en que vi tu mirada
Me derretiste con esa mirada
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...)
Pero el verano se volvio un invierno
Cuando vi que otros brazos te esperaban
Me congele mientras yo te esperaba

Y ahora entiendo cual es mi papel (Oh, oh...)
Nos queremos cuando nadie ve
Las balas perdidas de este amor (Oh, oh...)
Prefiero no verlas en mi piel

Si me preguntan por ti (Oh, oh...)
Dire que es mentira
Que toda una vida he sonado contigo
¡Yo sueno contigo!
Si me preguntan por ti (Oh, oh...)
Dire que no es cierto
Que duele por dentro que no estes conmigo
¡Te quiero conmigo!

Te miro, me miras y el mundo no gira
¡Todo parece mentira! (Oh, oh, oh, oh...)
Tu sigues, yo sigo, es nuestro castigo
Fingir que somos amigos
Y cuando no hayan testigos
Mi vida entera te dare cuando nadie ve
(Oh, oh, oh, oh...)

Cuando nadie ve (Oh, oh, oh, oh...)
Cuando nadie ve (Oh, oh, oh, oh...)

Y ahora entiendo cual es mi papel

Somebody said you got a new friend
But does she love you better than I can?
And there's a big black sky over my town
I know where you're at I bet she's around

And yeah I know it's stupid
But I just gotta see it for myself

I'm in the corner
Watching you kiss her
Oh oh oh
And I'm right over here
Why can't you see me?
Oh oh oh
And I'm givin' it my all
But I'm not the guy you're taking home, ooh
I keep dancing on my own

I just wanna dance all night
I'm all messed up, I'm so out of line
Stilettos on broken bottles
I'm spinning around in circles

And I'm in the corner
Watching you kiss her
Ooh
And I'm right over here
Why can't you see me?
Ooh
And I'm giving it my all
But I'm not the guy you're taking home, ooh
And I keep dancing on my own
And oh, no

So far away
But still so near
The lights come on
The music dies
But you don't see me standing here
I just came to say goodbye

I'm in the corner
Watching you kiss her
Oh oh oh
And I'm giving it my all
But I'm not the guy you're taking home
Oh oh oh
And I keep dancing on my own
And no, no

Said, I'm in the corner
Watching you kiss her
Oh, no
And I'm right over here
Why can't you see me?
Oh, no
And I'm giving it my all
But I'm not the guy you're taking home, ooh
And I keep dancing on my own

So far away
But still so near
The lights come on
The music dies
But you don't see me standing here

Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)
I know the feeling haunt you (Haunt)


This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars approach you, all the stars approach you, all the stars approach you
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer


Tell me what you gon' do to me
Confrontation ain't nothing new to me
You can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue
But you can't bring the truth to me
Fuck you and all your expectations
I don't even want your congratulations
I recognize your false confidence
And calculated promises all in your conversation
I hate people that feel entitled
Look at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you
Oh, you important?
You the moral to the story? You endorsing?
Motherfucker, I don't even like you
Corrupt a man's heart with a gift
That's how you find out who you dealing with
A small percentage who I'm building with
I want the credit if I'm losing or I'm winning
On my mama, that's the realest shit

Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)
I know the feeling haunt you (Haunt)


This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars approach you, all the stars approach you, all the stars approach you
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer

Skin covered in ego
Get to talking like ya involved, like a rebound
Got no end game, got no ways out, got to stay down
It's the way that you making me feel
Like nobody ever loved me like you do, you do
You kinda feel like you're tryna get away from me
If you do, I won't move
I ain't just cry for no reason, I ain't just pray for no reason
I give thanks for the days, for the hours
And another way, another life breathing
I did it all 'cause it feel good
I wouldn't do it at all if it feel bad
Better live your life, we're running out of time


Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for? (Ooh)
Or do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)
I know the feeling haunt you (Haunt)


This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars approach you, all the stars approach you, all the stars approach you
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer

Hit me up cus' we're going downtown
Back in the bank and we turn up now
Hold my hand cus' we're moving right now
Cool my head and we're leaving now

When you touch my heart
When you smile, my eyes
I will hold if you're feeling so low
I will meet you if you're rolling solo
When you touch my heart
When you smile, my eyes
I will hold if you're feeling so low
I will meet you if you're rolling solo

I will meet you if you're rolling solo
I will meet you if you're rolling solo
I will meet you if you're rolling solo
I will meet you if you're rolling solo
I will meet you if you're rolling solo

Take this way, 'cus we're leaving town
Now speeding it up, pedal down
Sing with me, 'cus we're leaving right now
Givin' it up, givin' it up, now

When you touch my heart
When you smile, my eyes
I will hold if you're feeling so low
I will meet you if you're rolling solo
When you touch my heart
When you smile, my eyes
I will hold if you're feeling so low
I will meet you if you're rolling solo

I will meet you if you're rolling solo
I will meet you if you're rolling solo
I will meet you if you're rolling solo
I will meet you if you're rolling solo
I will meet you if you're rolling solo
---------------------------------------------------
You know me the best
You know my worst, see me hurt, but you don't judge
That, right there, is the scariest feeling
Opening and closing up again
I've been hurt so I don't trust
Now here we are, staring at the ceiling

I've said those words before but it was a lie
And you deserve to hear them a thousand times

If all it is is eight letters
Why is it so hard to say?
If all it is is eight letters
Why am I in my own way?
Why do I pull you close
And then ask you for space
If all it is is eight letters
Why is it so hard to say?

Isn't it amazing how almost every line on our hands align
When your hand's in mine
It's like I'm whole again, isn't that a sign
I should speak my mind

I've said those words before but it was a lie
And you deserve to hear them a thousand times

If all it is is eight letters
Why is it so hard to say?
If all it is is eight letters
Why am I in my own way?
Why do I pull you close
And then ask you for space?
If all it is is eight letters
Why is it so hard to say? (woah, oh yeah)

When I close my eyes
It's you there in my mind
When I close my eyes

If all it is is eight letters
Why is it so hard to say?
If all it is is eight letters
Why am I in my own way?
Why do I pull you close
And then ask you for space
If all it is is eight letters
Why is it so hard to say?

If all it is is eight letters
When I close my eyes
It's you there in my mind (it's only you)
When I close my eyes
If all it is is eight letters
When I close my eyes
It's you there in my mind (you)
When I close my eyes
If all it is is eight letters

Kiss it, kiss it, kiss it
You make me say oh (Sheesh!), oh (Sheesh!)

And then we lay it back, talk the rest of the night
Things that we can light make me say oh (Sheesh!), oh (Sheesh!)
Talking 'bout what you wanna do, whether it's wrong or right
I am followin' you 'cause you make me say oh (Sheesh!), oh (Sheesh!)
(Hey) Said I don't know what I'd do without you in my life (ayy), it'd be so sour (Sweetener, ayy)

Make everything taste like it is salt (Sheesh, sheesh!)
Then you come through like the sweetener (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy) you are
To bring the bitter taste to a halt (Sheesh, sheesh!)

And then you get it, get it, get it, get it (Ayy)
Hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it (Ayy)
Flip it, flip it, flip it
You make me say oh (Sheesh!), oh (Sheesh!)
Twist it, twist it, twist it, twist it
Mix it and mix it and mix it and mix it
Kiss it, kiss it, kiss it (Sweetener, sweetener, sweetener, sweet)
You make me say oh (Sheesh!), oh (Sheesh!)
You make me say oh, babe!
Hey, ayy, oh yeah

I think that I'm falling down
You say that I'm crazy now
I know you can't stay around
Being dragging you on the ground

I think that I'm falling down
You say that I'm crazy now

Being dragging you on the ground

I hate it when dudes try to chase me
But I love it when you try to save me
'Cause I'm just a lady
I love it when we play 1950
It's so cold that your stare's 'bout to kill me
I'm surprised when you kiss me

So tell me why my gods look like you
And tell me why it's wrong

So I'll wait for you, I'll pray
I will keep on waiting for your love
For you, I'll wait
I will keep on waiting for your

Did you mean it when you said I was pretty?
That you didn't wanna live in a city
Where the people are shitty?
I like it when we play 1950
So bold, make them know that you're with me
Stone cold, will you miss me?

So tell me why my gods look like you
And tell me why it's wrong

So I'll wait for you, I'll pray
I will keep on waiting for your love
For you, I'll wait
I will keep on waiting for your

I hope that you're happy with me in your life
I hope that you won't slip away in the night
I hope that you're happy with me in your life
I hope that you won't slip away
I hate it when dudes try to chase me
I love it when you try to save me
'Cause I'm just a lady

So tell me why my gods look like you
And tell me why it's wrong

So I'll wait for you, I'll pray
I will keep on waiting for your love
(For your love, for your love, for your love)
For you, I'll wait
I will keep on waiting for your

Man, fuck y'all niggas, 'cause I'm that nigga
Nigga, nigga, nigga, I'm that nigga

I woke up in Chris Brown's body (oh yeah)
Somehow this shit turned into Freaky Friday
But we got no choice but to turn this bitch sideways (oh yeah, oh yeah)
I can't believe that it's freaky Friday
Yeah it's Freaky Friday
I'm in Chris Brown's body
I drive his Ferrari and I'm light-skinned black


(Ring ring, what the fuck)
I woke up and I'm Lil Dicky (Lil Dicky)
(Ugh, what the fuck)
This shit is real weak
How his dick staying perched up on his balls like that?
Walking down the street and ain't nobody know my name (whoa)
Ain't no paparazzi flashing pictures, this is great (whoa)
Ain't nobody judging 'cause I'm black or my controversial past
I'ma go and see a movie and relax (woo, let's go)
Ayy, I'm a Blood but I can finally wear blue (cool)
Why's his momma calling all the time?
Leave me the fuck alone, bitch
Wait, if I'm in Dicky's body, Breezy is who?
Hope my daughter's in school
Fuck, if I was Chris Brown, where would I be?
What would I do?


I woke up in Chris Brown's body (oh yeah)
Somehow this shit turned into Freaky Friday
But we got no choice but to turn this bitch sideways (oh yeah, oh yeah)
I can't believe that it's Freaky Friday
Yeah it's Freaky Friday
I'm in Chris Brown's body
I look at my soft dick with delight, it's my dream dick


If I was Lil Dicky in my body, where would I be?
I'm tryna find myself like an introspective monk

I'm balling on the court, oh my god I can dunk
Snap a flick of my junk

My dick is trending on Twitter, fuck
Now I'm at the club, I talked my way into getting in
I look up in the VIP, my goodness there I am
I signal to him to let me in but he won't let me in

I don't know who that is

Wait, who the fuck he think he is?
Took a glass bottle, shatter it on the bouncer's head (woo)
Walked up to that motherfucker

Wait, think it through for a sec
If you hurting me then you only hurting yourself

But wait, I love myself

That was the key, now we're switching back

I woke up in Chris Brown's body (oh yeah)
Somehow this shit turned into Freaky Friday
But we got no choice but to turn this bitch sideways (oh yeah, oh yeah)
I can't believe that it's Freaky Friday


Wait what the fuck?

And now I'm in Ed Sheeran's body
It's way less cool than being Chris Brown was


What the fuck again?

Huh, I'm Kendall Jenner

Holy shit, I got a vagina (uh), I'm gonna learn

---------------------------------------------------
Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up!
Yeah

Brain dead, eye drops
Pain meds, cyclops
Daybed, iPod
"May-back," Maybach
Trainwrecks, sidewalks
Payless, high-tops
K-Fed, iHop
Playtex, icebox

That's how much we have in common (Yah!)
That's how much we have in common (whoa!)
Up on this mic when we're on it (Yah)
That's how much we have in common (Yuh!)
That's how much we have in common (Woo!)
That's how much we have in common
We are not alike, there's nada like us on the mic (Yah!)

I don't do Jordans and Audemars
I do explosions and Molotovs
Y'all blowin' smoke as if y'all ain't washed
I blow the smoke from the car exhaust
Flyin' to a party I am not invited to, feelin' like the streets need me
I ain't gotta dance long as my Ferrari Spider move like C Breezy
I don't gotta hire goons
I'd rather try to buy the moon and breathe freely
The sky is blue, the tires new
The Maserati white and cool like G-Eazy
Why these dudes tryna figure out
How to do a freestyle as fly as me? (Why?)
I'm confused tryna figure out how to do Kapri Styles and Mya G
Everybody doin' chick joints
Probably rob these little dudes at fist point
'Member everybody used to bite Nickel
Now everybody doin' Bitcoin
We don't got nothin' in common (No!)
We don't got nothin' in common (No!)
Y'all into stuff like doubled-up Styrofoam cups
On them uppers-and-downers (Woo!)
I'm into stuff like doublin' commas
Find me a brother who's solid
To count the shit up and then bust the shit down
When the cops hit us up, we can flush the shit down
We cannot give a fuck, shit, a fuckin' colonic
Sellin' your cock and your butt for a follower
Possible couple of dollars, you powder sniff
Now you slippin', call it a power trip, a product of politics
Y'all went from profit and toppin' the charts
To dropped in the park in a pile of shit
Knowledge is power, but powerless
If you've got it and you do not acknowledge it
Y'all music sound like Dr. Seuss inspired it
Hirin' strippers, prostitutes retirin'
We can spit it for your advance
I'm fit to be king, you're cut out to fit in Prince pants
You niggas—

Brain dead, eye drops
Pain meds, cyclops
Daybed, iPod
"May-back," Maybach
Trainwrecks, sidewalks
Payless, high-tops
K-Fed, iHop
Playtex, icebox

That's how much we have in common (Yah!)
That's how much we have in common (whoa!)
Up on this mic when we're on it (Yah)
That's how much we have in common (Yuh!)
That's how much we have in common (Woo!)
That's how much we have in common
We are not alike, there's nada like us—

You say you're affiliated with murderers, killers (Ayy!)
The people you run with are thuggin' (Gang!)
But you just a wannabe gunner (Gang!)
Like you was gonna do somethin'
Actin' like you catchin' bodies (Ayy!)
And you got juice, lil' youngin', you buggin'
You ain't never even been charged in connection with battery
Bitch, you ain't plugged into nothin'
Rap God spit lyrical bullets (Pew!)
And gats cock, your partners better tool up
This has not to do with muscular
But have guns for sure, you better put a
Strap on, other words if you're gonna
Roll up with your (Gang!) you're gon' need a arsenal
'Cause this bar is over your head
So you better—
—have arms if you're gonna pull up (Skrrt!)
Oh, you run the streets, huh?
Now you wanna come and fuck with me, huh?
This little cock-sucker, he must be feelin' himself
He wants to keep up his tough demeanour
So he does a feature, decides to team up with N9na
But next time you don't gotta use Tech N9ne
If you wanna come at me with a sub, Machine Gun
And I'm talkin' to you
But you already know who the fuck you are, Kelly
I don't use sublims and sure as fuck don't sneak-diss
But keep commenting on my daughter Hailie
I keep on telling motherfuckers
But just in case you forgot really and need Ja memories jarred like strawberry or pineapple apricot jelly
I respond rarely, but this time Shady 'bout to sound off
Like a fuckin' cocked semi-Glock demi-god
Let me put a fuckin' silencer on this little
Non-threatening blond fairy cornball takin' shots at me
You're not ready, fool, break yourself like Rock Steady Crew
Obviously, I'm not getting through
We can get it poppin' like Redenbach, letting off like Remy Ma
Heavy artille—ry, Godzilla harsh with a hard shell
With a motherfucking heart bigger than Bizarre's belly
Only time you'll ever say I lost
You'll be talkin' 'bout Fetty Wap, better call Diddy
Just to try to get me off
And you better hope I don't call Trick Trick
Bitch, this shit don't fly in our city
Punk, you don't disrespect OGs, R.I.P. Prodigy
Sold Dre my soul and then told him the moment he signed me
That I'll be the most hated, though made it
So that there's no shame, it's okay to own it
'Cause life is a bitch, she's a bow-legged ho
But now those days are over
I Harvey Weinstein a bathrobe hanging open
My code name is groper, I role play with lotion
I fuck the whole world then I throw away the Trojan
Old lederhosen with home-made explosives
I blow 80 holes in you
Don't make me go in, I OJ the flows
And I'm insult to injury, Rolaids to Goldman
I'm throat spray and Motrin, I throated Nicole
As they both there to choke and my whole blade is soakin'
I double-edge sword it 'cause one place I poke and
I stick and I turn in a rotating motion
Invisible with the pen, I'm at the pinnacle of sick individuals
Stick my dick and put the tip in at minimal
I'm fuckin' these syllables, I let 'em lick on my genitals
I'm a fucking invincible, indefensible, despicable, difficult prick
A little bit unpredictable, I spit the formidable
That you bitches fuckin' with, the original
I consider me and Nickel identical—but not us
The only thing we have in common's I'm a dick and you suck
Otherwise one has nothin' to do with the other
None come close to skunk, bug, soldier
Tongue, shrub, shoulder, one month older
Sponge, mug, folder, nun, rug, holster
Lug nut, coaster, lung, jug, roaster
Young Thug poster, unplugged toaster

That's how much we have in common (Yah!)
That's how much we have in common (whoa!)
Up on this mic when we're on it (Yah)
That's how much we have in common (Yeah!)
That's how much we have in common (Woo!)
That's how much we have in common
We are not alike, there's nada like us—
(Man, fuck this shit, let's go)

Se que te gusto a ti todavia
Tres, dos, uno

Standing here in an empty room
I saw you there and my blood ran cold
Take me back to that long September
Don't know how I ever let you go

I was young, didn't know 'bout love
You were wild, couldn't get enough
Gave my heart to another lover
Don't know how I ever let you go

Find me, in another place and time
If only, if only you were mine
But I'm already someone else's baby
Guess I had my last chance
And now this is our last dance
You fell through the cracks in my hands
Hard to say it's over
But I'm already someone else's (C'mon)

Baby, ahh
Baby, ahh
Baby, ahh
But I'm already someone else's

All caught up in the way we were
I feel your hands getting close to mine
Don't say the words that I love to hear
The beat goes on and I close my eyes

I was young, didn't know 'bout love
You were wild, couldn't get enough
Let's leave things the way they were
You'll stay with me like a lullaby

Hey, se que te gusto a ti todavia por mucho que digas
Ademas puedo ver en tus ojos
Que no solo quieres quedar como amigos
Tienes mi corazon, eres mi obsesion
Soy tuyo pa' siempre

Guess I had my last chance
And now this is our last dance
You fell through the cracks in my hands
Tell myself be stronger
My heart's like a rubber band
And it's such a shame
You'll always be the one who got away
We both know that deep down you feel the same
Hard to say it's over
But I'm already someone else's (C'mon)

Baby, ahh (Eso no, eso no)
Baby, ahh (Mereces mejor)
Baby, ahh (Y a tu calor)
I'm already someone else's

Wish I met you at another place and time
If only, if only you were mine
This love story ends for you and I
'Cause I'm already someone else's
Baby, ahh (Contigo otra vez)
Baby, ahh (Mereces mucho mejor, mucho mejor)
Baby, ahh (Veo que lo que tienes con el no es amor)
But I'm already someone else's

Baby, ahh (Cada noche mas te extrano, cada dia sin ti me hace dano)
Baby, ahh (Sabes que mereces mejor, lo que sientes por el ya no es amor)
Baby, ahh (Por mucho que digas somos mas que amigos)
I'm already someone else's (Y el tiempo se acaba en cuatro, tres, dos, uno)
---------------------------------------------------
Yeah
Uh
Yeah
Woah

Baby could you? I got too much on my mind right now
I ain't got the time to get you Saint Laurent down
Could you? I got too much on my mind right now
Time to hit Rodeo, give my baby 30 thou'

Ball for me
B-ball for me, yeah
Ball for me
B-ball for me, yeah

I'm on the road, I'm gettin' paid, like what you want, baby? (What you want, baby?)
You're bougie, baby, but I love you, baby, give you the world, baby (you the world, baby)
Paid five grand for a handbag, that's Saint Laurent (Saint Laurent, baby)
Damn, you love that money, baby (oh-oh-oh)
Hunnid thousand plus hunnid thousand, my whip (my whip, my whip)
30 thousand plus 30 thousand, my wrist (my wrist, my wrist)
We got alcohol plus bad bitches, that's lit (that's lit, that's lit)
I swear baby, we was just kissin', that's it (that's it, that's it)
How could I forget the shit that you done done for me? (For me)
Baby gonna take the charge and take the fall for me (for me)
Would love to take you shoppin', but girl, I'll be on tour
Sorry, lil' mama, I can't give you more

Baby could you? I got too much on my mind right now
I ain't got the time to get you Saint Laurent down

Time to hit Rodeo, give my baby 30 thou'

Ball for me
B-ball for me, yeah
Ball for me
B-ball for me, yeah


Yo, gotta hit him on the jack
When you comin' back? Where is you at on the map?
Everything is intact
Could have been a seamstress, still wouldn't cut him slack
Pretty much, ain't got a clue
Itty bitty piggyback off everything I do
But I'm still droppin' jaws
Got 'em lookin' like James Harden at the awards
Back to you, I'm so into you
For real, bread like I'm kin to you
If you a 10, I add 10 to you
They be mad when I tend to you
That's what the bae like
Call me Buffy 'cause that's what I slay like
These bitches, I son 'em like it's daylight
These niggas wanna know what it tastes like
What it tastes like, yo, what it tastes like, yo
They wanna know what it tastes like, yo
All this ice, it should taste like snow
Get kimonos and let's fly to Tokyo
Pretty, pretty please baby, won't you cop this for me?


Baby could you? I got too much on my mind right now
I ain't got the time to get you Saint Laurent down
Could you? I got too much on my mind right now
Time to hit Rodeo, give my baby 30 thou'

---------------------------------------------------
Cannot recognize the face before me
It's unfamiliar
Time has left me broken down and homely
Can you still see me undisguised?

Outside the window of your eyes
Clinging to the memory of your prime
After many years the road you wandered
Left you here alone, deprived of others

On your toes or on your heels
There's a line drawn on the floor
Where the blood has dried there is no shine
Have another go my friend
You see I can't feel any more
While you question just who the hell am I

Is this all I am?
Given all I can?
Is this all I am?

Till the end of time
Never knowing why

Ghosts and damage no advantage for me
I'm past believing
Understand the price you pay disarming
When you can leave it all behind

Outside the window of your eyes
Clinging to the memory of your prime
After many years the road you wandered
Left you here alone, deprived of others

On your toes or on your heels
There's a hole worn in the floor
Where the blood has dried there is no shine
Have another go my friend
You see I can't feel any more
While you question just who the hell am I

Is this all I am?
Given all I can?
Is this all I am?

Till the end of time
Never knowing why

Cannot recognize the face before me
It's unfamiliar
---------------------------------------------------
All it'd take is one flight
We'd be in the same time zone
Looking through your timeline
Seeing all the rainbows, I
I got an idea
And I know that it sounds crazy
I just wanna see ya
All I gotta ask

Do you got plans tonight?
I'm a couple hundred miles from Japan, and I
I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight
'Cause I-I-I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind (oh)

Yeah, I could feel the tension
We could cut it with a knife
I know it's more than just a friendship
I can hear you thinking 'bout it, yeah
Do I gotta convince you
That you shouldn't fall asleep?
It'll only be a couple hours
And I'm about to leave

Do you got plans tonight?
I'm a couple hundred miles from Japan, and I
I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight
'Cause I-I-I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind

Do you got plans tonight?
I was hoping I could get lost in your paradise
The only thing I'm thinking 'bout is you and I
'Cause I-I-I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
I can't seem to get you off my mind

Let's get lost tonight
Let's get lost tonight
Baby, you and
I can't seem to get you off my mind
Let's get lost tonight
Let's get lost tonight
Baby, you and
I can't seem to get you off my mind

Do you got plans tonight?
I'm a couple hundred miles from Japan, and I
I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight
'Cause I-I-I can't get you off my mind
I can't get you off my mind

Do you got plans tonight, baby?
I was hoping I could get lost in your paradise
The only thing I'm thinking 'bout is you and I
And I-I-I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
I can't seem to get you off my mind, yeah

Let's get lost tonight
Let's get lost tonight
Baby, you and
I can't seem to get you off my mind
Let's get lost tonight
Let's get lost tonight
Baby, you and
I can't seem to get you off my mind

---------------------------------------------------
Motherfuckers talkin' crazy (Yeah)
Sayin' I should quit (Ah)
I fuckin' tell 'em make me (Bitch)
Eat a fuckin' dick (Yeah)
I'm feelin' like the greatest (Woo!)
On the beat who ever did it
Mike WiLL the one who made it
It's Shady on the lyrics

I'm somewhat outlandish they say
You say we're cut from the same cloth
But I guess you fabricate, eh?
You better bring more men than the Latter Day Saints
Manic states, Stephen Paddock with automatic stay sprayin'
At anything that may stand in they way
As I stand at the bay window with a hand grenade
And a trey eight, at the Mandalay Bay
Common sense, I'm a dollar short and a day late
James Holmes at the Saturday Batman matinee
Must have missed my CAT scan that day (Yeah!)
I just threw a Tampax at Dre
Trashcan, Tascam and ashtray
I'm turnin' back to a madman, can't take
Anymore but I try to get away from the anger and rage
My basal ganglia's an A to the K
Get your ass sprayed like bidets
Breakin' your legs eight different ways, ankle to waist
You chumps don't even know how to do somethin'
To give goosebumps a day when you say
That somethin' you wrote gave someone a lump in their throat
Or you had them choked up, you'd be yankin' my chain (Ayy)
Feelin' like I'm headed for the padded cell, the
Bar for me when I rap isn't fair but
Guess that's the standard I'm held to
But if somethin' like that doesn't tell ya
You set a mark too high when platinum sales are looked at as a failure (Yeah)
Then you better take it back to The Shelter and Hamburger Helper
'Cause, damn it, I'm still the

Greatest in the world, greatest in the world, greatest in the world
No lie, I might be
The best to ever do it, the best to ever do it, the best to ever do it
I feel like the greatest
Woke up to honkies sounding like me
Never be as good, never be as good
Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, white
But I'm the greatest

So you sold ten million albums, eh? (What?)
Only problem is, you put out ten million albums, eh? (Haha! Wait)
What was I just about to say?
Oh yeah, let me get this out the way
I know there's people that are pissed about the way
I mispronounced a name, "DIE ANTWOORD!"
Fuck, I still can't say this shit, but how quickly they forget
Who the fuck I was; now Ninja try to duck my slugs
You let ya girl get fucked by Muggs
I'd like to give a shout to Cypress (Woo!)
This can't be real, you dissed me and I was just tryin' to
Give you a shout—now get the fuck out my rhyme book
No more shiners, already too much time took
And rappers I hear you talkin' shit
I'm just too big to respond to it
God forbid I forget, go and jump out the window
Somebody better child-proof it
'Cause if I lose it we can rewind to some old Ja Rule shit
And I can remind motherfuckers how I do shit
You don't got the tools I got in my toolkit (Bitch!)
I bullshit you not, y'all fools just forgot
That I'm so fuckin' awful with the thoughts
And when I'm hostile and impossible to stop
So you can call it a nostril 'cause it's not gonna ever
I'll never let up on the pedal, might as well get the mop
'Cause I'm wipin' up everyone in this genre
'Cause on the mic I feel like I'm the

Greatest in the world, greatest in the world, greatest in the world
No lie, I might be
The best to ever do it, the best to ever do it, the best to ever do it
I feel like the greatest
Woke up to honkies sounding like me
Never be as good, never be as good
Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, white
But I'm the greatest

Oh yeah, and one more thing I want to mention (What?)
Is you're one dimension
I'm a monkey wrench and I can flunk detention
And I love contentions, so welcome to the gun convention
Muscles flexin', gotta strut like a front suspension
And you just stuck the key up in the ignition
And gave me enough gas to flood my engine (Yeah)
Psychopath, Michael Jack's blowin' up like a raft
I should slap Vlad with a ISIS flag
Bet you I come back twice as bad (Uh)
Revival didn't go viral!
Denaun and Royce tell me that I should take the high road
Fuck that, I'm finna hit back
'Til I run out of gunpowder and split the scene
Hold the mic similar to pistol, squeeze
And I shoot from the hip when I grip them things
And my lips are the clips, got the sig lit like it's nicotine
Trigger me and Slim gets mean (Brr!)
Bars are like bullets when I spit them schemes
That's why I call the motherfuckers M16s (Woo!)
Float like a butterfly, I'm gonna sting like a bee
You ain't harmin' a thing
I hit a ding hard as I'm gonna swing
I'm gonna need to put my arm in a sling
But like a wedding band
You gotta be diamond to even climb in the ring
Anomaly, I'm Muhammad Ali
'Cause I knew one day (Hey!) I'm gonna be the

Greatest in the world, greatest in the world, greatest in the world
No lie, I might be
The best to ever do it, the best to ever do it, the best to ever do it
I feel like the greatest
Woke up to honkies sounding like me
Never be as good, never be as good
Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, white
But I'm the greatest

Yeah
C5

Don't cry, don't go
Won't lie, I fuckin' love you, whoa!

Why y'all staring into the clouds
Am I rising or they comin' down?
I see death around the corner
And the U-turn sign's lookin' like a smile
What do I do now? Who gon' find me, how?
Nowhere to turn but around and round
Just another nigga that done lost his head
No, a fucking king that forgot his crown
I am not number one, it's true
I'm number 9-27-82
Color blind even if I may be blue
A lot on my plate, ain't my favorite food
But I'm hungry, so hungry
Need my family tree next to a money tree
With a bunch of leaves in the Garden of Eden
With a bunch of Eves, no fruit punch for me
I sip from the Fountain of Youth
So if I die young, blame the juice
Bury me in New Orleans
Tombstone reads: "Don't cry, stay tuned."
Bring me back to life
Got to lose a life just to have a life
But if heaven's as good as advertised
I want a triple extension on my motherfuckin' afterlife
Rest in paradise

Don't cry (Don't cry, don't cry), don't go (Why, oh why?)
Won't lie, I fuckin' love you, whoa!
Don't cry (Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry)
Don't go (Why, oh why, oh why, oh why?)
Won't lie (Don't cry, don't cry)
I fuckin' love you, whoa! (Don't cry, don't cry)

Talent is God-given, be grateful
Fame is not a given, be humble
And conceit is self-driven, drive carefully
Stay in your own lane, seat buckled
And sometimes when there is no music
We toot our own horns, rum-bum-bum-bum
That woman carried the future
And Tunechi was born like, "dun-dun-dun-dun-dun"
Don't call it a comeback
It was dark, now the sun back
Hit me hard, but I punched back
The wheels fell off, I rode the hubcap
Is it suicide or it's do or die?
It's newer days and it's bluer skies
I told myself, "It's just you and I"
Then the breeze came and it blew my mind
Lord knows who I'm there for
I give my last breath of air for
Mama tell me to be careful
Voice in my head give me an earful
But I got mind control over my control
I lost control but knew I'd find control
I let God control what I cannot control
Can't control the tears, let 'em drop and roll

Don't cry (Don't cry, don't cry)
Don't go (Why, oh why, oh why?)
Won't lie (Don't cry), I fuckin' love you, whoa!
(Triple extension on my motherfuckin' afterlife, rest in paradise)
Don't cry (Don't cry, don't cry)
Don't go (Why, oh why, oh why?)
Won't lie, I fuckin' love you, whoa! (Don't cry)

Don't cry, stay tuned
And triple extension on my motherfuckin' afterlife
Rest in paradise

Ma' yo tengo el poder, pa' ver como tu cuerpo se te eriza (ah, ah, ah)
Tu en mi ya marcaste una huella
Y es que por ti, baby, el pacto se sella
Tu y yo solos, y un par de botellas
Yo no voy a amarte, pero tu eres mi p-(¡ay!) y yo soy tu estrella
Con la combi entera Phillip Plein (oh-oh-oh)
Tu eres mi Victoria Secret y yo tu modelo de Calvin Klein
Yo nunca me bajo de un airplane
Pero no te preocupes que cuando terminemos vamo' a hacerlo again

Miento, si digo que no siento cosquillitas

Yo no quiero amarte, yo no quiero amarte (mamacita)
Quiero recogerte un Viernes y entregarte un Martes (Zion, baby)
Que conmigo la pases como con nadie
Quiero conocer mas alla de tu timidez (tu timidez, ah-ahh)
Yo se que tienes un lado oscuro (solamente hay que sacartelo)
Esta noche voy a mi, yo te aseguro (baby, baby)

Yo no quiero amarte, yo no quiero amarte (yo no quiero amarte, su-su)
Quiero recogerte un Viernes y entregarte un Martes (entregarte despues)
Que conmigo la pases como con nadie (como con nadie, mamacita)
Quiero conocer mas alla de tu timidez (tu timidez, ah-ahh, su-su-su)

Digo, quiero saciarme
Poco a poquito, hoy esta bueno pa' escaparse
Solamente tu y yo, donde pueda desnudarte
Y llegar a tu interior, no importa cuanto voy a gastarme
Vale mas de un millon
Algo distinto
Hoy tu y yo cambiaremos el destino
Mi forma de ser despierta tu instinto (tho, tho, tho, tho)
En esta escena sere tu asesino

Oh-aeh, algo distinto
Oh-aeh, cambiar el destino
Oh-aeh, despierta tu instinto
Oh-aeh, sere tu asesino (ah-ahh)

Yo no quiero amarte, yo no quiero amarte (yo no quiero amarte, su-su)
Quiero recogerte un Viernes y entregarte un Martes (entregarte despues)
Que conmigo la pases como con nadie (como con nadie, mamacita)
Quiero conocer mas alla de tu timidez (tu timidez)

Dim-Dim-Dime senorita
Una segunda cita
Dos copas de vino y un Franco de Vita
Es que yo te trato como una princesita
Aunque por la noche te me pone' diablita
Ya lo malo me incita y a mi me gusta mucho
En una esquina la serrucho
No quiero decir mucho
Voy directo al ataque

Aun, nena, te corre el calor por las venas
Y mas cuando la musica suena
Aun, nena, conmigo tienes un dilema
Un grave problema, yo soy quien te envenena

Oh-aeh, algo distinto
Oh-aeh, cambiar el destino
Oh-aeh, despierta tu instinto
Oh-aeh, sere tu asesino (zi-diri)

Yo no quiero amarte, yo no quiero amarte (yo no quiero amarte, su-su)
Quiero recogerte un Viernes y entregarte un Martes (entregarte despues)
Que conmigo la pases como con nadie (como con nadie, mamacita)
Quiero conocer mas alla de tu timidez (tu timidez, ah-ahh)

Yo no quiero amarte, yo no quiero amarte (no me enamoro)
Quiero recogerte un Viernes y entregarte un Martes (cuando ya no quiero mas)
Que conmigo la pases como con nadie (inolvidable)
Quiero conocer mas alla de tu timidez (tu timidez)

Ay, Justin Quiles, mami
Ay, mami, ay, mami

Ah-ahh

Viste, entregate y yo me encargo
Ese cuerpo me tiene sudando
Yo no quiero amarte
Solo vo' a perrearte
Pa' llevarte a Marte
Yo no quiero amarte
Duro pa dar-dar-dar-dar-darte

Game


At this age
How are them man still hating?
My young boy in a different country
But he ain't ever been on vacation
One hand on a girl I'm dating
One hand on the cash I'm making
We come through like Funky Friday
And have all of your mandem skating

I came in
550 on trainers
Island girl amazing
Could be Bajan, Trini or Haitian
She got a bag with flowers
If the trainers match I'll take it
Me and bro just shut down Gucci
Had the whole of the shop floor waitin'
Who's that girl in the line
With the big behind that's looking all tempting?
If her friend is a dead ting
Take one for the team with a bredrin
Two peng tings at the entrance
Want attention but a man can't lock them
She must think I'm a reverend
You ain't comin' here getting redemption
No way

At this age
How are them man still hating?
My young boy in a different country
But he ain't ever been on vacation
One hand on a girl I'm dating
One hand on the cash I'm making
We come through like Funky Friday
And have all of your mandem skating


I see dem man skatin' now
I'm talking about running their legs
My youngens in country
Plugging the Z
He can't even buck me
Till nothing is left
I flooded my right
I flooded my left
I'm ducking your wife
I'm ducking the feds
The bell on the trap it's buzzin' again
But still I ain't trying to get busted by feds
Look man I ain't caught the bust in a sec'
It's me and my rambo cutting through West
The way that I went in just flooded my neck
I'm shocked that I ain't gotta struggle for breath
With me and the missus be going on dates
She's holding the dipper
I'm holding her waist
Just see some pigs moving low in the mains
So I phone up my nigga and told him the plate


Tell a peng girl you can HMU
I don't wanna cuddle and H-U-G
And I'm still shopping in HMV
For all of my niggas in HMP
Heard you got a girl going DMU
If I dm'd you would she dm me?
Young black brudda
I'm a stylish g
Manna put the IC in IC3


They tell me I'm gifted in rap
Nothing was nice
Used to live in the trap
Now if I go ask that chick for her snap
I can bet money
She giving me that
I'm always in Harrods
I'm filling a bag
Them niggas ain't winners
Them niggas are mad
Gyal at my vids
And them bitches are bad
They get picked in the foreigns
And ditched in the cab

(You on the Boominati wave)
---------------------------------------------------
There's no reason, there's no rhyme
I found myself blindsided by
A feeling that I've never known
I'm dealing with it on my own

Phone is quiet, walls are bare
I drink myself to sleep. Who cares?
No one even has to know
I'm dealing with it on my own

I've got way too much time to be this hurt
Somebody, help. It's getting worse
What do you do with a broken heart?
Once the light fades, everything is dark

Way too much whiskey in my blood
I feel my body giving up
Can I hold on for another night?
What do I do with all this time?

Heavy thoughts, when it gets late
Put me in a fragile state
I wish I wasn't going home
Dealing with it on my own

I'm praying, but it's not enough
I'm done. I don't believe in love
Learning how to let it go
Dealing with it on my own

I've got way too much time to be this hurt
Somebody, help. It's getting worse
What do you do with a broken heart?
Once the light fades, everything is dark

Way too much whiskey in my blood
I feel my body giving up
Can I hold on for another night?
What do I do with all this time?
Yeah

I drive circles under street lights
Nothing seems to clear my mind
I can't forget
If it's inside my head
So, I drive chasing Malibu nights
Nothing seems to heal my mind
I can't forget

I've got way too much time to be this hurt
Somebody, help. It's getting worse
What do you do with a broken heart?
Once the light fades, everything is dark

Way too much whiskey in my blood
I feel my body giving up
Can I hold on for another night?
What do I do with all this time?
Yeah

I drive circles under street lights
Nothing seems to clear my mind
I can't forget
If it's inside my head
So, I drive chasing Malibu nights
Nothing seems to heal my mind
I can't forget
If it's inside my head

So, I drive chasing Malibu nights
Nothing seems to heal my mind
---------------------------------------------------
Guess I wake up knew everytime I'd lose my mind?
Going back and forth gotta keep it inside
If I let this go would you be surprised
Going back and forth gotta keep it inside
Oh way over this I'm running I'll hide
Going back and forth gotta keep it inside
Said I never gave my all but I tried

Are we so far so far gone
It felt so right and once again it's so long
One more time I swear God dammit I'm gone
All this back and forth all this leading me on

Yes I put up with you three too many times
Going back and forth gotta keep it inside
Could I break your heart before you touch mine
Going back and forth gotta keep it inside
Oh way over this you're wasting my time
Going back and forth gotta keep it inside
Act like giving me your all is a crime

Are we so far so far gone
It felt so right and once again it's so long
One more time I swear God dammit I'm gone
All this back and forth all this leading me on

You're thinking I'll sit here watch you walk away
Think maybe I'll change your mind or beg you to stay
I never put up with anyone treating me this way
You're not worth my time can't make up your mind
Thinking I'll sit around and wait

Are we so far so far gone
It felt so right and once again it's so long
One more time I swear God dammit I'm gone
All this back and forth all this leading me on

Fuck with dancers and models, shout out them girls who get dollars

Couple cases of Rose, came out to me with the sparkles

And I don't care if she take all of mine (oh)
Like it ain't shit but a dollar sign


She got that million dollar pussy, but I get it for the free
She like to do a lot of snow, I told that bitch to come and ski
Shawty bad, she can get it, she can swallow, she can spit it
Bring her friend, if she with it, on the pole, y'all can split it
In the bed or the Lamb'
Got your bitch suckin' dick on the 'Gram
V12 helped me get up out the jam, trunk full of slam

Then she told me put it on her chinny chin-chin (hey)
Pocket full of nothin' but them Benjy Franklins
With the gang posted up (up), puttin' numbers up (up)
Bitch, want me that check first, I don't wanna fuck (yeah)

She want a real nigga, dog, you ain't hood enough


What's in ya' mug? Toasted up, no I ain't hostin'
Kush all in my lap because these hoes don't want to roll it
I was sliding in the lamb' with the powerglide (oh)
Slime green paint, peanut butter inside (oh)

Coming out her clothes (oh)
I'm in wonderland when she comin' down the poll (whoa)
And I don't care if she take all of mine (oh)
Like it ain't shit but a dollar sign
