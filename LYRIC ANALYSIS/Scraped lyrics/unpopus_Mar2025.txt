I can see it now, tripping on split stones
Trying to make hits so we could play them loud
Picking at our souls like we didn't know
Just like we were only playing with the sound

Trying to control what was so low
But I never knew how then to just go and let it out
Get it out

But if you could fight
If you could choose
If you could say all the things you wanted to
If you couldn't lie
If you would only move like you had something to lose
If you could cry
If you couldn't sleep it off
If you could feel everything you've ever caused
If you couldn't lie
If you would only move like you had something to lose
Like you had something to lose
Like you had something to lose

And I'm not saying I would always speak up
That it didn't creep up on me all the time
I'm just saying there was a window
Where you could've let go in that place and time

Laughing all it off like it was innocent
Oh, but all I ever wanted was to get rid of it
And let it out (let it out)
Get it out

But if you could fight, if you could choose
If you could say all the things you wanted to
If you couldn't lie
If you would only move like you had something to lose
If you could cry, if you couldn't sleep it off
If you could feel everything you've ever caused
If you couldn't lie
If you would only move like you had something to lose
Like you had something to lose
Like you had something to lose

And I can see us there
You staring at me
And me just praying for air
I can see us there
Standing cheek to cheek
And counting week by week
Wishing everything would be clear
I can see us there
I can see us there

But if you could fight, if you could choose
If you could say all the things you wanted to
If you couldn't lie
If you would only move like you had something to lose
If you could cry, if you couldn't sleep it off
If you could feel everything you've ever caused
If you couldn't lie
If you would only move like you had something to lose
Like you had something to lose
Like you had something to lose

Yeah, we just faded in the night (yeah)

Never praying though while my Momma keep reading scriptures (yeah)
Sorry, but who else gon' be caring for all these strippers?
I'm puking in Gucci slippers (ayy)
Drinking that Fiji water (ayy)
Texting my sexy PA (ayy)

The universe up on my wrist, don't give a fuck now
She ain't never seen nothing like that
Fuck your past, let me rewrite that
I can change your life and be right back
Let me hear it talk, hear that bite back
Take that pussy for a walk in the air
She can have the night back
Motherfuck a night cap
Buy the whole bar, I'll motherfuck the price tag
Stack the money tall, I ain't even playing
So influential, when I ball I ain't paying

You're the prince to my ballerina
You feed other people's parking meters
You encourage the eating of ice cream
You would somersault in sand with me

You talk to loners, you ask how's your week
You give love to all and give love to me
You're obsessed with hiding the sticks and stones
When I fear the unknown
You feel like home, you feel like home

You put my feet back on the ground
Did you know you brought me around
You were sweet and you were sound
You saved me

You're the warmth in my summer breeze
You're the ivory to my ebony keys
You would share your last jelly bean
You would somersault in sand with me

You put my feet back on the ground
Did you know you brought me around
You were sweet and you were sound
You saved me

You put my feet back on the ground
Did you know you brought me around
You were sweet and you were sound
See I had shrunk yet still you wore me around
And 'round and 'round

So I want you to know, to know

Wherever you go
I'm not gonna hide out
I'll be your lighthouse
Whatever you do
I'll be your fire when it's cold out
I don't care if it's gonna break me
Don't give a damn, I'll be here waitin'
Wherever you go
No matter what you do
I'll keep the lights on
I'll keep the lights on
I'll keep the lights on

How, how did we get here
Oh now, now I just wish I held you closer
Yeah I know that I should probably move on
But I don't wanna believe it's all gone
So I want you to know, to know

Wherever you go
I'm not gonna hide out
I'll be your lighthouse
Whatever you do
I'll be your fire when it's cold out
I don't care if it's gonna break me

Dom bakk pa min grind som om jag va' skadad
Me' en blick som om jag va' satan
Dom dar ogonen som forfoljde mig nar jag stod dar pank pa min gata
Jag har dott och kommit tillbaka, brunnit frusit suttit o' skakat
Nu vi hundra ganger sa fucked up, men vi tusen ganger sa smarta
Klart jag sett pa folk hur dom pratar, me' sitt huvud hogt sa dom ball'ar
I sin fina bil och dom dyra jeansen som baba alltid betala
Dom vet ingenting om o' skrapa (nej)
Dom vet ingenting om o' sakna (nej)
Dom vet ingenting om o' offra allt for att ta sig dit man vill vara

Vissa saker ga upp (upp upp)
Andra saker gar ner (ner ner)
Vi e' ba' vi' o du e' ba' du' och ingenting mer (na' ingenting mer)
Vissa saker ga upp (vissa saker gar upp)
Andra saker gar ner (andra saker gar ner)
Ja vi e' ba' vi' o du e' ba' du' och ingenting mer (han e' ingenting mer)

De' mycket snack om vad ni hort om vad vi gor och om det bra eller de' samst men fucking kor nu tills vi dor o' motherfucker de' blir fett
Vi drog dom korten som vi har o' tror vi spelade dom ratt ni satt pa sjua och en tvaa fick er tro att vi har ess

Stilen skraddarsydd synkad sitter formen slick i kanten som en syndare
Som har vandrat stigen lange synisk utan syn tills mitt synesatt vidgades
Jag har oppnat dorrar, slutit fred och sett hur mina yxor antligen fatt gravas ner
Jag kan do i frid men inte om jag kanner att jag alltid hade lite mer o' ge
Sa ge mig nagonting o' skriva pa, jag river ner ridan
Forvandlar varlden med mitt ord till en ny niva
Jag har ett storre mal, an vad du kan forsta
Sa ge mig svardet lat mig hugga ner varan demon
Du kan ta mig pa orden som blindskrift
Det tog ett tag for min sjal att fa insikt
Men jag har funnit min styrka ur konflikt
Nu ar min konst lika stark som min instinkt

Vissa saker ga upp (upp upp)
Andra saker gar ner (ner ner)
Vi e' ba' vi' o du e' ba' du' och ingenting mer (na' ingenting mer)
Vissa saker ga upp (vissa saker gar upp)

Mitt gang e har for natt annat
Ingen ar har for nan' standard
Mitt gang ar har for o' do
Ditt gang ar har for o' stanna
Vi svischar forbi er (vrom)
Mannen vi skiter vem ni e'
Vi korde var lane, zubbis tittade o' vi signade aldrig pa dealen (aldrig)
Vi la' varan grund ah
Vi la' det stabilt (vi la det stabilt)
For att bygga nat' tungt brah
Det tar lite tid (det tar lite tid)
Men nu det gar runt haa
Vi andra vart liv (vi andra vart liv)
Nu benim kan punda
Hon gor en

En subba ifran trakten e' pavag att smutsa ner
De' bast vi satter stopp innan hon skadar nagon mer
De' verklighet hon lever i vill inte se oss le
O' anda har vi aldrig nansin gjort nat' ont mot er

I know you've got the best intentions
Just trying to find the right words to say
Promise I've already learned my lesson
But right now, I want to be not okay

I'm so tired, sitting here waiting
If I hear one more "Just be patient"
It's always gonna stay the same

So let me just give up
So let me just let go
If this isn't good for me
Well, I don't wanna know

Let me just stop trying
Let me just stop fighting
I don't want your good advice
Or reasons why I'm alright

You don't know what it's like
You don't know what it's like

Can't stop these feet from sinking
And it's starting to show on me
You're staring while I'm blinking
But just don't tell me what you see

I'm so over all this bad luck
Hearing one more "Keep your head up"
Is it ever gonna change?

So let me just give up
So let me just let go
If this isn't good for me
Well, I don't wanna know

Let me just stop trying
Let me just stop fighting
I don't want your good advice
Or reasons why I'm alright

You don't know what it's like
You don't know what it's like

Don't look at me like that
Just like you understand
Don't try to pull me back

Let me just give up
Let me just let go
If this isn't good for me
Well, I don't wanna know

Let me just stop trying
Let me just stop fighting
I don't want your good advice
Or reasons why I'm alright

You don't know what it's like
You don't know what it's like
You don't know, you don't know, you don't know
You don't know what it's like
You don't know what it's like
You don't know, you don't know
You don't know what it's like
You don't know what it's like
---------------------------------------------------
Always you will be part of me
And I will forever feel your strength
When I need it most
You're gone now, gone but not forgotten
I can't say this to your face
But I know you hear

I'll see you again
You never really left
I feel you walk beside me
I know I'll see you again

When I'm lost, when I'm missing you like crazy
And I tell myself I'm so blessed
To have had you in my life, my life

I'll see you again
You never really left
I feel you walk beside me
I know I'll see you again

When I had the time to tell you
Never thought I'd live to see the day
When the words I should have said
Would come to haunt me
In my darkest hour I tell myself
I'll see you again

I'll see you again
You never really left
I feel you walk beside me
I know I'll see you again

Someday I'll see you again
I'll see you again
You never really left
I feel you walk beside me
I know I'll see you again

I will see you again
I'll see you again
I'll see you again
I miss you like crazy
You're gone but not forgotten
I'll never forget you
Someday I'll see you again
I feel you walk beside me
Never leave you, yeah
Gone but not forgotten
I feel you by my side
No this is not goodbye
No this is not goodbye
No this is not goodbye
I'll see you again
---------------------------------------------------
You took me back
But you shouldn't have
Now it's your fault
If I mess around
I took a drag
But I shouldn't have
Now I'm coughing up
Like I never smoked a pack

Gasoline, pretty please
I want to get off
But you're such a tease
Throw the keys
Back to me
Go on and kick off your boots
In the passenger seat

I get sad, you know I get sad
And I can't look past what I'm sad about
You did me bad and I did it back
You needed as well, what's wrong with that?

Gasoline, pretty please
I want to get off
But you're such a tease
Throw the keys
Back to me
Go on and kick off your boots
In the passenger seat

We're watching the sunrise from the kitchen counter
But when you lie in between my legs it doesn't matter
You say you wanna go slower but I wanna go faster
Faster, faster

Gasoline pretty please
I want to get off
But you're such a tease

Stroll along your street
Can't believe there's not a thing in the world
A thing left to repeat

And I was walking on your floor
Begging to get more
Can't believe there's not a thing in the world
A thing left to ask for

So leave my broken bones
I'll take a load of your skin
Throw me all your stones
For me to sit around in

Every time I walk on by
Stroll along your street
Can't believe there's not a thing in the world
A thing left to repeat

So leave my broken bones
I'll take a load of your skin
Throw me all your stones
For me to sit around in
So leave my broken bones
I'll take a load of your skin
Throw me all your stones
For me to sit around in

Don't you know
Don't you know what to say
Every time you think about it
Talk around it again

Don't you know
Don't you know where to stay
Every time you think about it
Talk around it again

Don't you know
Don't you know what to say
Every time you think about it
Talk around it again

Don't you know
Don't you know where to stay
Every time you think about it
Talk around it again

No hev oska lagt seg
Verda er gra og gr¯delauss
Spring spirar upp fra si grav
Spring dei sigrande upp
til sin f¯rste dag

Eg er ikkje stor
Men tida pa jord
Vil eg nyttje og na
Opp til himmelen bla
Renn tarane strie
Ta glede og sorg
For alt som fekk plass
For alt som gav plass

For spirar som blomar
For hjartet som sler
Renn tarane strie
Ta glede og sorg
For alt som fekk plass
For alt som gav plass
Renn tarane frie
Fra skyane gra

Upp or Jordi
Ris mot soli
Rein er kjensla
Wunjo!

F¯ter sma
I verda tra
Utan stans,
I ringen danser
Wunjo!



The ashes have fallen
The earth grey and barren
Sprout spring from their grave
Victorious they spring
to their first day

I may not be big
But my time here on earth
I shall use and reach
Into the blue sky
Tears fall freely
From joy and from sorrow
For all that got place
For all that gave place

For the sprout which flowers
For the beating heart
Tears fall freely
From joy and sorrow
For all that gave glace
For all that got place
Tears fall freely
From the grey clouds

Up from the soil
Rise towards the sun
Pure is the feeling
Wunjo!

Little feet
Shall roam the earth
With no stop,
the ring is danced
Wunjo!
---------------------------------------------------
And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain
I've lived a life that's full
I traveled each and every highway
And more, much more than this, I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption
I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
And more, much more than this, I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall and did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
Oh, no, oh, no, not me, I did it my way

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows
I took the blows
And did it my way

Yes, it was my way
---------------------------------------------------
Think of days when I was yours, seems so long ago
Now we're standing in the cold, nervous when we talk
Such a sadness in your eyes and now you're looking down
You try your hardest not to show it
Yeah, I can't hold you, give you hope, 'cause I'm not comin' home

And I wish that I could give you more
When you're leaving me an open door
And I wish that I could let you know
How it hurts me too that we're moving on

Oh where do love go?
It's right in your hands, then it's suddenly gone
Oh no, nobody knows where it disappears
And it breaks my heart

Empty station, 2 A.M., see your name on the phone
Saying, "So good to see you but it made me really miss you
It's hard to be alone"

And I wish that I could give you more
When you're leaving me an open door
Yeah, I wish that I could let you know
How it hurts me too that we're moving on

Oh where do love go?
It's right in your hands, then it's suddenly gone
Oh no, nobody knows where it disappears
And if I only could, I'd go back in time
Take back every word, say, "I've changed my mind"
But no, nobody knows where it disappears

I know it hurts us
But I don't have it
Say, we were happy, so what happened?
Now you're acting
Like it's nothing, But it was something
You can't erase me
All the memories, you can't change them

Oh where do love go?
It's right in your hands, then it's suddenly gone
Oh no, nobody knows where it disappears
And if I only could, I'd go back in time
Take back every word, say, "I've changed my mind"
But no, nobody knows where it disappears
And it breaks my heart

(I know it hurts us)
(But I don't have it)
(Say, we were happy)
(So what happened?)
---------------------------------------------------
That was the last New Year I'll ever see
And I wanna stay on that magic mountain
With lost souls and beautiful women
I drank some of Farmer's potion
And we were moving in slow motion

The slower, the better
The slower, the better
'Cause there's no one old on magic mountain
There's no one old, old on magic mountain

And that was the very last barn I'm burning
So for now everyone is dancing
As if it's any time but the present
So for now every young thing in my path
I'll hold their face so long inside my hands

The longer, the better
The longer, the better
'Cause there's no one old on magic mountain
There's no one old, old on magic mountain

The wine has all been emptied
And smoke has cleared
As people file back to the valley
On the last night of life's party
These days the years thin till I can't remember
Just what it feels like to be young forever

So the longer I stay here
The longer there's no future
So I'm growing old on magic mountain
I'm growing old, old on magic mountain
---------------------------------------------------
And we've waded through the suffering and pain
The bitches ride the dick like the A-train
That's why I flip
Keep a burner to my hip
Take a hooker to the crib, you know she got to strip
Stay dipped, take out of state trips
Don't drink a lot of Hennessy, I only take a sip
I'm a skipper, like a captain, rappin' is my speciality
And the best is me

You're lucky I don't run you over in the SUV
And if you feel some kind of way you can S-M-D
Me, Fizzy and the King, that's a special three
Far as money, less you work, the less you see
Put hands on 'em, they just wanna S-U-E
You could never do what I can do unless you me
'Cause dog I'm a low cat
I bring that dope back
No matter how they feel about me, just let 'em know that

I got love for New York City, New York City
And they got love for me and B-I-G
They always gon' hold us down
We got that work in New York City
Where they be talkin' real fast, all about the cash
New York City, New York City

And we've waded through the suffering and pain
The bitches ride the dick like the A-train
That's why I flip
Keep a burner to my hip
Take a hooker to the crib, you know she got to strip
Stay dipped, take out of state trips
Don't drink a lot of Hennessy, I only take a sip
I'm a skipper, like a captain, rappin' is my speciality
And the best is me

Remember me and you smokin' in the Lexus Jeep
And you schoolin' me on how to bless these streets
Told me to, "Get your money, Kiss, F these beefs"
Get your paperwork right and you can catch these thieves
The game is forever a part of me
'Cause as far as NYC, I'm the main artery
Nobody parallel or even half as smart as me
You was just a draft pick, I was a lottery
It's still love

I got love for New York City, New York City
And they got love for me and B-I-G
They always gon' hold us down
We got that work in New York City
Where they be talkin' real fast, all about the cash
New York City, New York City

And we've waited through the suffering and pain
B.I
And bitches ride the dick like the A-train
Fizzy
And we've waited through the suffering and pain
Jada
And bitches ride the dick like the A-train
We got that work
And we've waited through the suffering and pain
We made it
And bitches ride the dick like the A-train
Get off me
And we've waited through the suffering and pain
And bitches ride the dick like the A-train
We got that work, baby
B.I.G
NYC
B.I.G
Forever hold us down
Biggie, Biggie, Biggie, Biggie
Love y'all
B.I.G
Yeah
B.I.G
---------------------------------------------------
I, I think I know how I feel
'Cause I, I only play it for real
You should be picking me up instead you're dragging me down
You're flying over my head, you're landing all over town

You, you know that I try
Try to tell you the truth, oh, baby don't make me cry
You should be picking me up instead you're dragging me down
Now I'm missing you more 'cause baby you're not around
Now that you're not around

I, I want to know how it feels
'Cause I, I only play it for real
You should be picking me up instead you're dragging me down
I could be giving you love but you're not around, now that you're not around
Now that you're not around, glad that you're not around
...
---------------------------------------------------
So baby, when I'm near you
You can't feel me, I'm lightnin'
You used to come by
And sit down by my side
You would come in close
And take off all my clothes

Every time I think that I've been takin' the steps
You end up mad at me for makin' a mess
I can't understand, why you don't understand me
Baby
And every day I wake up and I make money for myself
And though we share a bed, you know that I don't need your help
Do you understand?
You don't understand me
Baby

All the ivy
Is growing sideways
You won't stop it
'Till it covers all my place

Every time I think that I've been takin' the steps
You end up mad at me for makin' a mess
I can't understand, why you don't understand me
Baby
And every day I wake up and make money for myself
And though we share a bed, you know that I don't need your help
Do you understand?
You don't understand me
Baby

If I go right
And you go left
Hey, I know we'll meet up again
And if you go left
And I go right
Hey, maybe that's just life sometimes

Every time I think that I've been takin' the steps
You end up mad at me for makin' a mess
I can't understand, why you don't understand me
Baby
And every day I wake up and make money for myself
And though we share a bed, you know that I don't need your help
Do you understand?
You don't understand me
Baby

---------------------------------------------------
I won't just survive
Oh, you will see me thrive
Can't write my story
I'm beyond the archetype

I won't just conform
No matter how you shake my core
'Cause my rootsóthey run deep, oh

Oh, ye of so little faith
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it
Victory is in my veins
I know it, I know it
And I will not negotiate
I'll fight it, I'll fight it
I will transform

When, when the fire's at my feet again
And the vultures all start circling
They're whispering, "You're out of time,"
But still I rise

This is no mistake, no accident
When you think the final nail is in
Think again
Don't be surprised
I will still rise

I must stay conscious
Through the madness and chaos
So I call on my angels
They say

Oh, ye of so little faith
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it
Victory is in your veins
You know it, you know it
And you will not negotiate
Just fight it, just fight it
And be transformed

'Cause when, when the fire's at my feet again
And the vultures all start circling
They're whispering, "You're out of time,"
But still I rise

This is no mistake, no accident
When you think the final nail is in
Think again
Don't be surprised
I will still rise

Don't doubt it, don't doubt it
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You know it, you know it
Still rise
Just fight it, just fight it
Don't be surprised
I will still rise
---------------------------------------------------
You have a mythological beauty
You have the eye of someone I have seen
Outside of ordinary situations
Even outside of dreams
You lie in bed at night and watch the lines of headlights through your screen
There is a child inside you who's trying to raise a child in me

If you wanna leave
You just have to say
You're all caught up inside
But you know the way

You cut the flesh of your left thumb
Using your boyfriend's knife
Seventeen, you took his cum
And you gave birth to your first life
You gave Andrew a family who you thought would love and take better care
I have an older brother I don't know
He could be anywhere

If you wanna leave
You just have to say
You're all caught up inside
But you know the way
You're all caught up inside
But you know the way

Rented a house in Nisswa, Minnesota
Shrapnel and oil cans, rhubarb in the yard
I built a ladder out of metal pieces
Father was working hard
Standing beneath the oak tree by the front door
You were inside baking bread
Sister came out and put her arms around me
Blood gushing from my head
You held me in the backseat with a dishrag, soaking up blood with your eyes
I was just five and you were twenty-seven
Praying, "Don't let my baby die."

If you wanna leave
You just have to say
You're all caught up inside
But you know the way
You're all caught up inside
But you know the way

So much more to live your life
To walk the floor
To say goodnight
Do you leave your light on?
Do you leave your light on?
You're all caught up inside
But you know the way
---------------------------------------------------
Pick yourself up off the floor
Voice won't be silenced anymore
These wings will soar
Struggle to open your eyes
Swollen from all of your cries
Look to the sunrise

And I know that the weight is pulling you down
We didn't come all this way to let love drown
Keep my head up, try to stay above the water
But my heart keeps sinking

Oh love, where did you go?
Oh love, where did you, where did you go?
Oh love, where did you go?
Oh love, where did you, where did you go?
Cause I need hope that these sticks and stones
Won't break my bones
Oh love, where did you go?
Oh love, where did you, where did you
Go oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Go oh oh oh, oh oh oh

Lifted the veil, we're all sinners
Crowned the devil a winner
And you tell me that it'll be just fine
Scarier than any bad dream
Can't wake up from his regime
So don't tell me to sit down and dine

And I know that the weight is pulling you down
We didn't come all this way to let love drown
Keep my head up, try to stay above the water
But my heart keeps sinking

Oh love, where did you go?
Oh love, where did you, where did you go?
Oh love, where did you go?
Oh love, where did you, where did you go?
Cause I need hope that these sticks and stones
Won't break my bones
Oh love, where did you go?
Oh love, where did you, where did you
Go oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Go oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Go oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Go oh oh oh, oh oh oh

Excuse my pessimistic tone, I normally can do better
But the battle to keep my light burning seems harder than ever
These walls of hate will suffocate, and one by one we will deflate
So this I cry and this I pray, our card will trump and you will break, oh

Oh love, where did you go?
Oh love, where did you, where did you go?
Oh love, where did you go?
Oh love, where did you, where did you go?
Cause I need hope that these sticks and stones
Won't break my bones
Oh love, where did you go?
Oh love, where did you, where did you
Go oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Go oh oh oh, oh oh oh
---------------------------------------------------
Tayo na namang dalawa
Walang sali-salita
Pinag-tagpo ng tadhana

Magkasamang nag-isa
Sa bawat sulyap lang ba
Tayong pwede magkita

Naghihintay, may mauna sa'ting dalawang
Madulas, oh oh oh

Lagi lagi namang walang pakialam
Oh ako ba sa iyo'y walang pagasa
Puso ay laging nasasaktan
Hanggang kunwari nalang ba ako aasa

Hanggang kunwari
Hanggang kunwari

Bilang ko ang bawat hakbang
Mula ating pagbaba patungong dulong sakayan
Maglilihis nang ating landas
Bukas kaya muli kang masisilayan

Oh sana ay di lang anino 'kong nakita
Hanggang sa muli

Lagi lagi namang walang pakialam
Oh ako ba sa iyo'y walang pagasa
Puso ay laging nasasaktan
Hanggang kunwari nalang ba ako aasa

Hanggang kunwari
Hanggang kunwari

Naghihintay, may mauna sa'ting dalawang
Madulas, oh oh oh

Lagi lagi namang walang pakialam
Oh ako ba sa iyoy walang pagasa
Puso ay laging nasasaktan
Hanggang kunwari nalang ba ako aasa

Hanggang kunwari
Hanggang kunwari
---------------------------------------------------
When I mess up I can't help but smile
Why don't you stay for a while?
I got a few things to say
But you don't care anyway
(You just don't care)
I must be talking to a wall
(A Wall)
Cause girl, your face
(Your face)
Says it all

You just don't care
I wish you cared
(I wish you cared)
Why don't you care
With me
Tonight?

When?
---------------------------------------------------
When I walk beside her, I am the better man
When I look to leave her, I always stagger back again
Once I built an ivory tower so I could worship from above
When I climbed down to be set free, she took me in again


There's a big, a big hard sun
Beating on the big people
In the big hard world

When she comes to greet me, she is mercy at my feet
When I see her bitter charm, she just throws it back at me
Once I dug an early grave to find a better land
She just smiled and laughed at me and took her blues back again



When I go to cross that river, she is comfort by my side
When I try to understand, she just opens up her hands



Once I stood to lose her when I saw what I had done
Bound down and threw away the hours of her garden and her sun
So I tried to warn her, I turned to see her weep
Forty days and forty nights and it's still coming down on me
---------------------------------------------------
Girl, we still got something here, I stay believing
Plus, I'm not going nowhere 'til I'm not breathing
Hell yeah, I made some mistakes
But there's no reason we can't move on from this page

I know I got to cussing and I got to screaming and I got to losing my cool
I got to smoking and I got to drinking and taking my shit out on you
I got some habits, I thought I could have it, my cake, and be eating it, too
Damn, can't we move on from this pain

Cause I ain't the same
Turn the car around, I'm not going back
Put out the flames
Hey, look at me now, I'm not going back
And, girl, I'm changed, changed
Yes, I'm changed, changed

See, I was hearing voices 24/7
Not saying they weren't my choices, baby, I made 'em
But if I knew what it meant, I would've changed 'em
Can we move on from this pain?

I know I got to cussing and I got to screaming and I got to losing my cool
I got to smoking and I got to drinking and taking my shit out on you
I got some habits, I thought I could have it, my cake, and be eating it, too
Damn, can't we move on from this pain

Cause I ain't the same
Turn the car around, I'm not going back
Put out the flames
Hey, look at me now, I'm not going back
And, girl, I'm changed, changed
Yes, I'm changed, changed

I know I crossed the line
But I swear, if I had one more time to fix it
I know I'd change your mind, 'cause from today, I've changed

Cause I ain't the same
Turn the car around, I'm not going back
Put out the flames
Hey, look at me now, I'm not going back
And, girl, I'm changed, changed
Yes, I'm changed, changed

Girl, believe I turn and leave, I guarantee I've changed
Girl, tonight, I'm moving right, I've seen the light, I'm changed

Benzin, Benzin
Sie wollten Wasser, doch sie kriegen Benzin
Benzin, Benzin
Sie schrei'n nach Wasser, doch sie kriegen Benzin

Im Kopf wieder tausend Stimmen, der Blick in den grauen Himmel
Nur die Nikes an den Fuﬂen kennen den Weg, um hier lebend raus zu finden
Ich gebe dir tausend Grunde, besser zu werden als der Rest
Der lieber wieder nur ballert, als seinen Traum zu finden ñ was ein Trauerspiel!
Ich sitz' im Studio, jeden Tag, kille die Hooks wie Peter Pan
Tausch' mein Leben ein auf Beats und was hast du dafur getan?
Quatschst mich voll, redest und redest den ganzen Tag
Vom Leben und dem Masterplan, Junge, beweg mal deinen Arsch!
Nur du selbst hast dich vergessen, wer sonst soll dich retten?
Jeder Tag macht dich harter und es sterben deine Helden
Denn so wie es beginnt, lasst Gott es auch wieder enden
Doch dazwischen liegt allein in meinen Handen

Was denkst du, wer du bist? Was denkst du, wer ich bin?
Willst du Licht, musst du dir erstmal den Schatten verdienen
Was denkt ihr, wer ihr seid? Was denkt ihr, wer wir sind?
Sie wollten Wasser, doch kriegen Benzin
Benzin, Benzin
Sie wollten Wasser, doch sie kriegen Benzin
Benzin, Benzin
Sie schreien nach Wasser, doch sie kriegen Benzin

Es gibt auch ein'n Himmel fur die Gauner, ein'n See nach dem falschen Weg
Doch schone Augen kleben meistens auf 'nem dicken Portemonnaie
Ein Labyrinth aus lila Scheinen, der Teufel schmeiﬂt mit Schnee
Lass deine Ehre nicht erliegen, weil sie schon so vielen fehlt
Aber merk dir eins: Mich kriegt ihr nicht, denn es heiﬂt, "Alles oder nichts"
Doch ich lass' sie den Erfolg nicht buchstabier'n ohne mich
Mit meinem Rucken an der Wand, Bruder, fuhrt kein Weg mehr zuruck
Und egal, wie sehr man mich hasst, ich reiﬂ' den Schatten in das Licht
Ich hab' niemanden vergessen, denn keiner kommt mich retten
Jeder Tag macht mich alter und es sterben meine Helden
Denn so wie es beginnt, lasst Gott es auch wieder enden
Doch dazwischen liegt allein in meinen Handen

Was denkst du, wer du bist? Was denkst du, wer ich bin?
Willst du Licht, musst du dir erstmal den Schatten verdienen
Was denkt ihr, wer ihr seid? Was denkt ihr, wer wir sind?
Sie wollten Wasser, doch kriegen Benzin
Benzin, Benzin
Sie wollten Wasser, doch sie kriegen Benzin
Benzin, Benzin
Sie schreien nach Wasser, doch sie kriegen Benzin

Benzin, Benzin

Mother Earth is pregnant for the third time
For y'all have knocked her up
I have tasted the maggots in the mind of the universe
I was not offended
For I knew I had to rise above it all
Or drown in my own shit

Come on Maggot Brain
Go on Maggot Brain
---------------------------------------------------
Per uno come me
C'e un'altra come te
Che sogna ancora le montagne
Che parla piano ad un gigante
Che abbassa gli occhi e dice
Io rimango in superficie
Che vado a fondo in un istante
Sono di piombo le mie gambe a volte sai
Basterebbe poi dirsi
Che va bene anche cosi
Senza incontrarsi
L'importante e che tu sappia
Che almeno noi in questa galassia
Siamo due punti, si lontani, ma equidistanti
Come due stronzi

Amami anche se non mi conosci
Ti prego amami
Anche se siamo nascosti
Amami senza dovermi cercare
Senza sapere da che parte stare
Resta nel mondo in cui tu vuoi invecchiare
Io verro a prenderti

Per una come te
Lo sai c'e un altro come me
Che pensa solo e sempre al mare
Come la fuga piu ideale
Che crede sia speciale
Basta sapere improvvisare
Per non doversi poi aspettare
Come previsto quel finale
E allora sai
Che ne dici se adesso
Ci sforiamo lo stesso
Senza toccarci
Tu chiudi gli occhi

Amami anche se non mi conosci
Ti prego amami
Anche se siamo nascosti
Amami senza dovermi cercare
Senza sapere da che parte stare
Resta nel mondo in cui tu vuoi invecchiare
Io verro a prenderti

Amami anche se non mi conosci
Ti prego amami
Anche se siamo nascosti
Amami senza paura del mare
Senza respiri piu da trattenere
Amami e basta senza piu sapere
Se verro a prenderti li
E io verro a prenderti li

Amami, anche se non mi conosci
Ti prego amami
Anche se siamo nascosti
Amami senza paura del mare
Senza respiri piu da trattenere
Amami e basta senza piu sapere
Se verro a prenderti li

What I feel, I can't say
But my love is there for you anytime of day
But if it's not love that you need
Then I'll try my best to make everything succeed

Tell me, what is my life without your love
Tell me, who am I without you, by my side

What I know, I can do
If I give my love now to everyone like you
But if it's not love that you need
Then I'll try my best to make ev'rything succeed

Tell me, what is my life without your love
Tell me, who am I without you, by my side
Tell me, what is my life without your love
Tell me, who am I without you, by my side

What I feel, I can't say
But my love is there for you any time of day
But if it's not love that you need
Then I'll try my best to make everything succeed

Tell me, what is my life without your love
Tell me, who am I without you, by my side
Oh tell me, what is my life without your love
Tell me, who am I without you, by my side

What is my life without your love
Tell me, who am I without you, by my side


Oh tell me, what is my life without your love
Tell me who am I without you by my side
---------------------------------------------------
You're hard on yourself
Well you can't always be right
All those little things that keep you up at night
You should take some time to figure out your life
But you're stuck indoors and thinking poorly

You'll find in time
All the answers that you seek
Have been sitting there just waiting to be seen
Take away your pride and take away your grief
And you'll finally be right where you need to be

Take all of it, take everything you're owed
'Til you finally feel okay being alone
Yeah it's different now
Yeah it's different now, you're old

And you try and you try and you try and you try
---------------------------------------------------
I know that we are young, and I know that you may love me
But I just can't be with you like this anymore
Alejandro

She's got both hands in her pocket
And she won't look at you, won't look at you
She hides true love, en su bolsillo
She's got a halo around her finger, around you

You know that I love you, boy
Hot, like Mexico, rejoice
At this point, I've gotta choose
Nothing to lose

Don't call my name, don't call my name, Alejandro
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe, Fernando
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette and hush
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Roberto
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro

Stop, please, just let me go
Alejandro, just let me go

She's not broken
She's just a baby
But her boyfriend's like her dad, just like her dad
And all those flames that burned before him
Now he's gotta firefight, gotta cool the bad

You know that I love you, boy
Hot, like Mexico, rejoice
At this point, I've gotta choose
Nothing to lose

Don't call my name, don't call my name, Alejandro
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe, Fernando
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette and hush
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Roberto
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro

Don't bother me, don't bother me
Alejandro
Don't call my name, don't call my name
Bye, Fernando
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe
Alejandro
Don't wanna kiss
Don't wanna touch
Fernando
Don't call my name, don't call my name
Alejandro
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe
Fernando
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette and hush
Don't call my name, don't call my name
Roberto

Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro
(Don't call my name, don't call my name) Alejandro, Alejandro
(I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe) Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro (Fernando)
(Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch) Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro (Just smoke my cigarette and hush)
(Don't call my name, don't call my name) Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro (Roberto)
Alejandro
---------------------------------------------------
Just an old fashioned kiss
It gets me hot even in winter
How can I resist?
Oh, how you tease me

A simple kiss upon my cheek
Makes my knees a little weaker
Your lips are like a spring
Morning dew on a red rose

Kiss me quick
Kiss me hard
Make it slow
Make it soft
Cheek to cheek
Palm to palm
Just as long
As you keep me close

Caress me in the park
Smooch me up in a taxi
And those lingering hugs
You got me in paradise

And I'm feeling love
So much love
And you give me those lips
Don't ever stop
Don't stop

To kiss me quick
Kiss me hard
Make it slow
Make it soft
Cheek to cheek
Palm to palm
Just as long as you keep me close

Just as long as you keep me close
---------------------------------------------------
For some this is all a game
Don't take me just a fool
Won't you just stay the fuck out of my way
Faking smiles and acting all the cool

From the sidelines to the front wide
I still be saving up for them new shoes
All the while I'll be wishing it's alright
Cause my main man on the right plays it good


I see the sunrise getting high
I wish I was next to you
So coming down it's alright
Stumble through your gold snafu


Yeah, for the first time in my life
I seen them velvet skies
And all that hurt was froze in ecstasy
I teach you how to fly

Forever's overthrown
And everybody comes alive
It's as simple as it's sold
And sexy as a slippery water slide



So coming down it's alright
Stumble through your gold snafu
---------------------------------------------------

Kriegst du rote Wangen, wenn du mich siehst?
Hast du das Gefuhl, dass du nicht gut genug bist fur mich?
Und nicht schon - Fuhlst du dich blod?
Weil du jede Nacht nur von mir traumst
Manchmal auch bei Tag - Sag, dass es so ist
Sag, dass es so ist, denn genau so soll es sein

Ich lass dich einfach nicht los
Ich will doch ich kann nicht
Hundert auf rot
Ich will dich vergessen, aus meiner Welt loschen
Sonst schieﬂ mich halt tot

Kriegst du weiche Knie, wenn du mich siehst?
Meinst du des Ofteren, dass du spinnst
Weil du sonst so gar nicht bist - Warst das nicht du?
Die, die sagte, dass sie sich niemals verliebt
Dass es keinen fur sie gibt - Deine Welt steht schief
Sag, dass es so ist, denn genau so soll es sein

Ich lass dich einfach nicht los
Ich will doch ich kann nicht
Hundert auf rot
Ich will dich vergessen, aus meiner Welt loschen
Sonst schieﬂ mich halt tot

Ich lass dich einfach nicht los
Ich will doch ich kann nicht
Hundert auf rot
Ich will dich vergessen, aus meiner Welt loschen
Sonst schieﬂ mich halt tot

Ich lass dich einfach nicht los
Ich will doch ich kann nicht
Hundert auf rot
Ich will dich vergessen, aus meiner Welt loschen
Sonst schieﬂ mich halt tot

A Baggio quando piove, piove un botto (Un botto)
Esco con lei, metto il pigiama sotto (Sotto)
Ma non perche ci devo andare a letto
E che quando sto giu un botto non basta il giubbotto
Mentre ballavo ho perso la pazienza (Oh-oh)
Deve essermi caduta dalla tasca (Yeah, yeah)
E chi mi sta vicino la calpesta
E, cazzo, questo drink e solo acqua
Credi in Dio? (Seh) Ti piace Beyon'? ('Ce)
Andresti a Rio? (Seh) Ma dici io e te?
Nell'ozono ci sta un buco e tu ti chiedi perche (Yeah, yeah)
Le cazzate che tu dici inquinano pure me (Pure me)

Boogieman
Spegni queste nuvole (Yeah, yeah)
Che lei si bagna piu di me
Poi faccio cose stupide, stupide

Mhm, ma non e cool
Non e cool
Mhm, ma non e cool
Non e cool
(Mhm, Yeah) Mhm, ma non e cool

In Sardegna il sole picchia forte, sembro su Marte
Appeso ai fili elettrici come le scarpe (Uoh)
Faccio una canna sotto il sole e volo su un charter
Potrei morire e vedere chi c'e dall'altra parte
Mi piaci se ti muovi tipo "I Love It" (Yeah)
C'e chi in bagno fa una pista piu di Cairoli (Yeah)
C'e chi e bravo a cantare solo se fa i nomi
Noi torniamo a casa zombie tipo Nairobi
Giuro, una di queste sere
Chiudo e smetto quando voglio
Sto sul fondo del bicchiere
Ma di quello mezzo vuoto
Frate', vengo in pace (Oh), cambio mille facce (Oh)
Chiama il vecchio Salmo e digli che mi dispiace (Scusa)
Sono diventato tutto cio che ho sempre odiato
E mi piace

Boogieman
Spegni queste nuvole (Yeah, yeah)

Poi faccio cose stupide, stupide

Got the news this morning
Knew it'd be a tough day
Some are so much larger than life
You can't believe they could pass away
When it comes to country music he's the world
And it wouldn't be all it is without Merle

He won't ever be gone
His songs live on
A fugitive and a branded man
Mama tried to understand
Left us a lifetime of songs
And he won't ever be gone

We were friends right from the start
We shared some high times
I would sing some songs he wrote
He would sing a few of mine
The music made us brothers till the end
And not a day goes by that I don't miss him

He won't ever be gone
His songs live on
Ramblin' fever and the way I am
Blue collar blues for the working man
We'll be singing him back home from now on
He won't ever be gone

He won't ever be gone
His songs live on
A fugitive and a branded man
Mama tried to understand
Left us a lifetime of songs
He won't ever be gone

We'll be singing him back home from now on
He won't ever be gone
---------------------------------------------------
Dark days holding me down
And it's so grey, got my head in the cloud
And you
You feel it too
But I told you that we'd figure it out
All these old fools that we're better without
And you
You know it's true, yeah

But tell me, tell me
Tell me what it is that you need
Cause I think I'm onto something
Cause I feel the good times coming
Tell me, tell me
Tell me what it is that you need
Cause I think I'm onto something

Tell me, tell me what it is that you need
Cause I think I'm onto something
Cause I feel the good times coming
(Cause I feel the good times coming)

We're getting by, we've done it before
All the nightmares that I've learned to ignore
And you
You've been there too
But somehow I can settle the score
Cause I know now that I need more
And you
You know it too, yeah

But tell me, tell me
Tell me what it is that you need
Cause I think I'm onto something
Cause I feel the good times coming
Tell me, tell me
Tell me what it is that you need
Cause I think I'm onto something

Yeah
Ow!

How'd it ever get so wrong?
Crying in the stall of a washroom floor (Yeah)
You niggas don't know where I'm from
Don't know how I got here, but I'm all alone
And I've been waking up feeling as lonely as I was before, but
No, I cannot stick around for long
Tell my mom, 'cause I know she wants me home now (Home now)

I'm just a shame
I'm just a waste (Uh-uh)
It's the way it is
'Cause my momma said

Swear you're never gonna see me fall
Take it how I get it then I ask for more
A different town is all I'm asking for
Pack up all my things and hurry out the door
I never asked to be driven away in a foreign car
'Cause the bus will take me just as long
And now I gotta sleep with the lights still on now

I know you're tired of me doing the same
I know you're tired of me running away
I don't think you'll ever really see me the same
Life ain't so bad at all
Now I need a lot of-

I'm just a shame
I'm just a waste
It's the way it is
'Cause my momma said

I'm just a shame
I'm just a waste (Uh-uh)
It's the way it is
'Cause my momma said
I'm just a shame
How'd it ever get so wrong? (Ha!)
Crying in the stall of a washroom floor (I'm just a waste)
(It's the way it is)
You niggas don't know where I'm from (Cause my momma said)
Don't know how I got here, but I'm all alone
I'm just a shame (How'd it ever get so wrong?)
I'm just a waste (Crying in the stall of a washroom floor)
It's the way it is
'Cause my momma said
I know you're tired of me doing the same
I know you're tired of me running away
---------------------------------------------------
Oh, my love
My darling
I've hungered for your touch
A long, lonely time

And time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine?

I need your love
I need your love
God speed your love to me

I need your love
Oh, I need your love
God speed your love to me, ooh
To me
---------------------------------------------------
I don't know if you were looking at me or not
You probably smile like that all the time
And I don't mean to bother you but
I couldn't just walk by
And not say, "Hi"

And I know your name
'Cause everybody in here knows your name
And you're not looking for anything right now
So I don't wanna come on strong
Don't get me wrong

Your eyes are so intimidating
My heart is pounding but
It's just a conversation
No, girl I'm not wasted
You don't know me
I don't know you but I want to

I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time

I don't wanna wreck your Friday
I ain't gonna waste my lines
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time

And I know it starts with "Hello"
And the next thing you know you're trying to be nice
And some guy's getting too close
Trying to pick you up
Trying to get you drunk

And I'm sure one of your friends is about to come over here
'Cause she's supposed to save you from random guys
That talk too much and wanna stay too long
It's the same old song and dance but I think you know it well

You could've rolled your eyes
Told me to go to hell
Could've walked away
But you're still here
And I'm still here
Come on let's see where it goes

I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time

I don't have to meet your mother
We don't have to cross that line
I don't wanna steal your covers
I just wanna take your time

I don't wanna go home with you

I just wanna be alone with you

I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time

I don't wanna blow your phone up
I just wanna blow your mind
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time

No, I ain't gotta call you baby
And I ain't gotta call you mine
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time
---------------------------------------------------
Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak
Somewhere in this town
See me and the boys, we don't like it
So we're getting up and going down

Hiding low looking right to left
If you see us coming I think it's best
To move away do you hear what I say
From under my breath

Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak
Somewhere in the town
Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak
So don't you be around

Don't you be around

Tonight there's gonna be trouble
Some of us won't survive
See the boys and me mean business
Busting out dead or alive

I can hear the hound dogs on my trail
All hell breaks loose, alarm and sirens wail
Like the game if you lose
Go to jail

Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak
Somewhere in the town
Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak
So don't you be around
Tonight there's gonna be trouble
I'm gonna find myself in
Tonight there's gonna be trouble
So woman, stay with a friend

You know it's safer

Breakout

Tonight there's gonna be a breakout
Into the city zones
Don't you dare to try and stop us
No one could for long
Searchlight on my trail
Tonight's the night all systems fail
Hey you, good-looking female
Come here

Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak
Somewhere in the town
Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak
So don't you be around
Tonight there's gonna be trouble
I'm gonna find myself in
Tonight there's gonna be trouble
So woman stay with a friend
---------------------------------------------------
I've been written off so many times before
I've forgotten what it feels like to succeed anymore
Always on the sidelines, waiting in the wings
When the curtain finally calls, I'm never on the screen

And I've got the scars to prove I've been there
I've got the marks from when I tried
I've covered miles and miles to get here
Only for you to cast me aside

But I'll still run, run like the wind
And I'll still start, start all over again
I gave it all, cause I had to make it
I gave it all, cause I had to try
I sacrificed my close connections
For the chance to say I tried

I've never learned to win, don't know what it means
I lost myself when we were young, I'm fighting just to feel
Always on the edge, I just want to make my name
I'd love to show the world what I gave up for the game

And I've got the scars to prove I've been there
I've got the marks from when I tried
I've covered miles and miles to get here
Only for you to cast me aside

But I'll still run, run like the wind
And I'll still start, start all over again
I gave it all, cause I had to make it
I gave it all, cause I had to try
I sacrificed my close connections
For the chance to say I tried

And I've got the scars to prove I've been there
I've got the marks from when I tried
I've covered miles and miles to get here
Only for you to cast me aside

Oh, I've got the scars to prove I've been there
I've got the marks from when I tried
I've covered miles and miles to get here
Only for you to cast me aside

But I'll still run, run like the wind
And I'll still start, start all over again
I gave it all, cause I had to make it
I gave it all, cause I had to try
I sacrificed my close connections
For the chance to say I tried

But I'll still run, run like the wind
And I'll still start, start all over again
I gave it all, cause I had to make it
I gave it all, cause I had to try
I sacrificed my close connections
For the chance to say I tried

Living for the weekend state of mind makes me sick
Just thinking of the bad habits
People passing out in parking lots
That you only live once way of thinking
It's so twisted are you living or just wasted
An escape cause you can't face it

If a psycho said this is the end
I think I'd believe him

Now the whole world is full of it
Building a bunker and jumping in
After everyone self destructs
Pop the hatch and we'll climb back up
Now the whole world is full of it
Building a bunker and jumping in
After everyone self destructs
Pop the hatch and we'll climb back up
Back up

This self-centered generation taking pictures
Of themselves then changing features
Pleasing over critical creatures
Everyone's got a cause but how strong is the foundation
Moving like the waves of the ocean
Do you care or just throw stones in?

If a billboard read this was the end
I think I'd believe it

Now the whole world is full of it
Building a bunker and jumping in
After everyone self destructs
Pop the hatch and we'll climb back up
Now the whole world is full of it
Building a bunker and jumping in
After everyone self destructs
Pop the hatch and we'll climb back up
Back up

I heard there's a hot new craze of driving off a steep cliff
Are you gonna do it? What will they say if you won't?
I hear there's a brand new trend where you swallow bags of thumbtacks
Are you gonna do it? What will they say if you don't?

Now the whole world is full of it
Building a bunker and jumping in
After everyone self destructs
Pop the hatch and we'll climb back up
Now the whole world is full of it
Building a bunker and jumping in
After everyone self destructs
Pop the hatch and we'll climb back up
Back up

(It's the end of the world as we know it)
I'm building a bunker and jumping in
(It's the end of the world as we know it)
Are you gonna do it? What will I say if you won't?
(It's the end of the world as we know it)
I'm building a bunker and jumping in
(It's the end of the world as we know it)
Are you gonna do it? What will I say if you don't?

North Star
Rolling round the heavens and watching me pine
The whole night through
When we were together the terror sublime
Would turn me blue
When you're in her mirror you don't even know
Your own green eyes
Fella interstellar I'm broken in two
And I blame you

North star giz a little sprinkle of heavenly dust
I just need sane
Wishing on you got me a hatful of rain
And three lost years
When you're in her mirror you don't even feel
The tears that fall
Fella interstellar I'm miles from home
The blame is yours
Blame you, blame you

Hey there
Woke up on a curbstone as high as a sofa
Dopey and hopeless
Hey there
Show me to the corner of firebrand and angel
Open a place and I'll
Stay there
One day in a whirlwind she'll call for a late one
Stay for a lifetime
Meantime
My best friend never-ending forgets all my stories
And lies of my glories

Hey there
Woke up on a curbstone as high as a sofa
Dopey and hopeless
Hey there
Show me to the corner of firebrand and angel
Open a place and I'll
Stay there
One day in a whirlwind she'll call for a late one
Stay for a lifetime
Meantime
My best friend never-ending forgets all my stories
And lies of my glories

Hey there
Woke up on a curbstone as high as a sofa
Dopey and hopeless
Hey there
Show me to the corner of firebrand and angel
Open a place and I'll
Stay there
One day in a whirlwind she'll call for a late one
Stay for a lifetime
Meantime
My best friend never-ending forgets all my stories
And lies of my glories

Hey there
Woke up on a curbstone as high as a sofa
Dopey and hopeless
Hey there
Show me to the corner of firebrand and angel
Open a place and I'll
Stay there
One day in a whirlwind she'll call for a late one
Stay for a lifetime
Meantime
My best friend never-ending forgets all my stories
And lies of my glories
So then
---------------------------------------------------
Mi hai dato tutto
Ma niente avevi
Mi hai fatto amare tutti i miei difetti
E come ho fatto io quando non c'eri?
Non prendere impegni per i prossimi anni

Che sara domani
Non so che cosa dirti
Domani sara ieri, ma si
Noi non saremo uguali
Ma dentro i nostri abbracci, quelli si

Nei tuoi occhi c'e il cielo piu grande che io abbia visto mai
E le tue braccia uno spazio perfetto in cui ci tornerei per sempre
In cui ci resterei per sempre

Siamo due gocce
Dello stesso mare
Ma abbiamo gia trovato l'ultimo amore
Nemmeno un'ombra nel tuo sorriso
Beatrice non avrebbe niente da insegnarti
Ragazza paradiso

Nei tuoi occhi c'e il cielo piu grande che io abbia visto mai
E le tue braccia una spazio perfetto in cui ci tornerei per sempre
In cui ci resterei per sempre

E di tutta questa vita
Io non butterei via niente
Solo una mi completa fra milioni di persone
Ogni cuore ha le sue pieghe
Ogni volto ha le sue rughe
Non hai fatto mai promesse ma le hai mantenute tutte
Si, le hai mantenute tutte
Tu le hai mantenute tutte
Si, le hai mantenute tutte

Nei tuoi occhi c'e il cielo piu grande che io abbia visto mai
E le tue braccia uno spazio sicuro in cui ci tornerei per sempre
In cui mi perderei per sempre
E poi ci resterei per sempre
Si
---------------------------------------------------
Blank stares
Looking right through me
I'm right here
Why can't you just see I love you?
Say anything but goodbye
We've climbed up this high

I don't want to lose you, darling
This can't be the end
Hanging by a thread
Right over the edge
Promise me you're gonna hold on
Don't give up on me right now
And please just don't look down

Cold hands
But you won't let me hold them
All our plans
Looks like you forgot them
I'm never giving up
I can't stop
But it seems like you want me to

I don't want to lose you, darling
This can't be the end
Hanging by a thread
Right over the edge
Promise me you're gonna hold on
Don't give up on me right now
And please just don't look down

Say anything but goodbye
We've climbed up this high (don't look down)
Say anything but goodbye
We've climbed up this high

I don't want to lose you, darling
I don't want to lose you, darling (no)

I don't want to lose you, darling (say anything but goodbye)
This can't be the end (we've climbed up this high)
Hanging by a thread
Right over the edge
Promise me you're gonna hold on (say anything but goodbye)
Don't give up on me right now
And please just don't look down
---------------------------------------------------
Everyone seems so far away
Glittering jewels that you never had
You'll never own anything

Seems so far behind
See yourself in the places you've been
Some other time

In endless blue
Reflections look so good
You're never certain of anything
Unless you go in

Endless blue
Seems so far away
A glittering jewel that you never had
Nor will you again

At high tide, high tide

Everyone seems so far away
Glittering jewels that you never had
You'll never own
Everything seems so far behind
See yourself in the places you've been
Some other time

At high tide, high
As far as you can say
At high tide, high tide

Endless, endless, endless
It's endless
---------------------------------------------------
Ce soir Billie ne chantera pas
Desole pour vous, ca ne l'enchante pas
Cupidon a tire, puisses-tu etre robuste
Love, tu tombes meme avec des gros muscles
Partie sans crier gare et maintenant
Voila qu'on entend parler d'enlevement
Mais nous savons que Dieu ne peut laisser Billie disparaitre
Parait-il, lorsqu'elle chante la pluie s'arrete
On cherche celle qui n'a pas disparu
Cachee dans un cafe sous une perruque
Le videur l'a reconnue, la laisse tranquille
La belle est loin, pensive
Billie fait son film, elle vit son conte de fee

Tu veux vivre le conte de fee
Tu voulais vibrer
Je vais vous livrer un petit secret

C'etait la fin de sa tournee au Japon
Elle l'a vu comme un chaton paume dans ce cinq etoiles
Il l'a toucha d'un regard ignorant qu'elle etait star
Il lui sort son char :
"Mademoiselle vous m'avez declenche
J'viens du Val de Marne, mon cúur vient de se pencher
Aimez-vous les tulipes, car je ne danse pas
Rendez-vous ce jeudi 30, je serai dans ce bar"
Lui fit croire qu'il taffait dans les cosmetiques
Tito pensait seduire une traductrice
Frustres, tellement ils se charmerent
La prochaine nuit sera plus que charnelle
Pour vivre un conte de fee, il s'y fait tard
Mais tout peut arriver, meme au Lipopette Bar
C'est le conte de fee

Tu veux vivre le conte de fee
Tu voulais vibrer
Je vais vous livrer un petit secret

Ce soir, Billie ne chantera pas
Il y a des souvenirs qu'on oublie pas comme ca
Une poupee qui attend devant l'orphelinat
Tous convaincus que l'histoire finit mal
Tres vite, l'air est inquietant
Bris de verre, peur en dilettante
Yuri s'echappe, arrive une odeur d'echarpe
Suivi d'une voix charmante :
"Mademoiselle, vous m'avez declenche
Amoureux, mon cúur est tombe
Il s'est trop penche sur vous"
Tito se tenait la, debout
Une echarpe en soie blanche autour du cou
Billie, l'estomac noue
Bouche bee, ca ,on l'a tous fait
En vivant son conte de fee
Je vais vous livrer un petit secret :
La vie devient ce qu'on en fait

Funf-Sterne-Hotel, wo mein SL parkt
Alles Slang, nur den Import aus Medellin
Tilidin, Anabolika und Medizin

Nehme als Kondom deine Skinnyjeans
Schwerverbrecher in der Tagesschau

Fur dich ist rappen nur Kardashians
Fur mich ist rappen nur gerappter Slang
Ich komm' in den Club wie der letzte Mensch
Oversize-Yeezy-Season-Drei
Wir diskutier'n nicht, Mann, wir schieﬂen gleich

Where it began
I can't begin to knowin'
But then I know it's growin' strong

Was in the spring
And spring became the summer
Who'd have believed you'd come along

Hands, touchin' hands
Reachin' out, touchin' me, touchin' you

Sweet Caroline
Good times never seemed so good
I've been inclined
To believe they never would
But now I...

...look at the night
And it don't seem so lonely
We fill it up with only two

And when I hurt
Hurtin' runs off my shoulders
How can I hurt when holdin' you?

Warm, touchin' warm
Reachin' out, touchin' me, touchin' you

Sweet Caroline
Good times never seemed so good
I've been inclined
To believe they never would
Oh, no, no

Sweet Caroline
Good times never seemed so good
Sweet Caroline
I believed they never could

Sweet Caroline
Good times never seemed so good
---------------------------------------------------
Unholy war
My demons are coming
Boy, you better run
Go take your freedom, oh no
Wade in the water
Be gone by morning
Don't you let them find you here
Oh no

Let love lead you home, oh no
Let redemption keep you warm
So, you better run
You better run

Time has come
Future is now, oh love
Steady on
Go take your bow
Weather the storm
Good times will pass you by
Hit the road
Leave your sorrows behind

Oh, would you let love lead you home, oh please
Let redemption keep you warm
So, you better run
You better run

I know it's killing you
Well, well, well, well
You gotta leave
I know it's killing you
Oh no
You gotta leave
I know it's killing you
You gotta leave
I know it's killing you
You gotta leave

So, you better run
You better run
Oh save yourself, please
You better run
You better run
---------------------------------------------------
Ricordo quegli occhi pieni di vita
E il tuo sorriso ferito dai pugni in faccia
Ricordo la notte con poche luci
Ma almeno la fuori non cíerano i lupi
Ricordo il primo giorno di scuola
29 bambini e la maestra Margherita
Tutti mi chiedevano in coro
Come mai avessi un occhio nero

La tua collana con la pietra magica
Io la stringevo per portarti via di la
E la paura frantumava i pensieri
Che alle ossa ci pensavano gli altri
E la fatica che hai dovuto fare
Da un libro di odio ad insegnarmi líamore
Hai smesso di sognare per farmi sognare
Le tue parole sono adesso una canzone

Cambia le tue stelle, se ci provi riuscirai
E ricorda che líamore non colpisce in faccia mai
Figlio mio ricorda
Líuomo che tu diventerai
Non sara mai piu grande dellíamore che dai

Non ho dimenticato líistante
In cui mi sono fatto grande
Per difenderti da quelle mani
Anche se portavo i pantaloncini
La tua collana con la pietra magica
Io la stringevo per portarti via di la
Ma la magia era finita
Restava solo da prendere a morsi la vita

Cambia le tue stelle, se ci provi riuscirai
E ricorda che líamore non colpisce in faccia mai
Figlio mio ricorda
Líuomo che tu diventerai
Non sara mai piu grande dellíamore che dai

Lo sai che una ferita si chiude e dentro non si vede
Che cosa ti aspettavi da grande, non e tardi per ricominciare
E scegli una strada diversa e ricorda che líamore non e violenza
Ricorda di disobbedire e ricorda che e vietato morire, vietato morire

Cambia le tue stelle, se ci provi riuscirai
E ricorda che líamore non ti spara in faccia mai
Figlio mio ricorda bene che
La vita che avrai
Non sara mai distante dallíamore che dai

Ricorda di disobbedire
Perche e vietato morire
Ricorda di disobbedire
Perche e vietato morire
Perche e vietato morire
Vietato morire
---------------------------------------------------
Se fosse tutta colpa mia
Non me lo perdonerei
Quante volte hai detto
Il tempo non cancella
Nella mia stanza l'odore di noi
Che non passa mai
Che lentamente scivola come pioggia su di me
E mi bagna la faccia, lascia un solco perfetto
Ti sorrido distrutta
Sono pazza lo ammetto

Amore amore amore andiamo via
Chiudo gli occhi non m'importa ma tu portami via
Amore amore amore amore mio
Ogni giorno mi sveglio e tu sei gia andato via ancora

Si forse e solo colpa mia
Cosi non ci pensi piu
Sono molto brava sai a rovinare tutto
Tu sei perfetto non sbagli mai
In tutto cio che fai
Sei abile a nasconderti
Ma non sai rinunciare a me
Come solo due sguardi
Sanno tenersi la mano
Basta un attimo solo per scappare lontano

Amore amore amore andiamo via
Chiudo gli occhi non m'importa ma tu portami via
Amore amore amore amore mio
Ma ogni giorno mi sveglio e tu sei gia andato via ancora

Sono qui tra le cose da fare
Io cerco la calma vivendo la normalita
Nei messaggi nascondo il bene che sento
Riempie i polmoni e so gia
Noi due siamo diversi
Ma come due pazzi
Ci urliamo contro
E poi passeremo la notte dicendo

Amore amore amore andiamo via
Chiudo gli occhi non m'importa ma tu portami via
Amore amore amore amore mio
Ma ogni giorno mi sveglio e tu sei gia andato via

Amore amore amore e una follia
Apro gli occhi non m'importa
Ma tu vattene via
Amore amore amore amore mio
Ora spengo la luce e ti lascio
Questa notte ancora
---------------------------------------------------
Bucka-bucka-bucka-bucka-bucka-bucka, ha ha!
You know the deal: it's just me, yo
Beats by Su-Primo for all of my people, Negroes and Latinos
And even the gringos

Yo, check it
1 for Charlie Hustle, 2 for Steady Rock
3 for the forthcoming live future shock
It's 5 dimensions, 6 senses
7 firmaments of heaven and hell, 8 million stories to tell
9 planets faithfully keepin' orbit, with the probable 10th
The universe expands left
The body of my text possess extra strength
Power-lift the powerless up out of this towering inferno
My ink so hot it burn through the journal
I'm blacker than midnight on Broadway and Myrtle
Hip-Hop passed all your tall social hurdles
Like the nationwide projects-prison-industry complex
Working-class poor: better keep your alarm set
Streets too loud to ever hear freedom ring
Say evacuate your sleep, it's dangerous to dream
For ch-ching, cats get the "cha-pow!" You dead now
Killing fields need blood to graze the cash cow
It's a numbers game, but shit don't add up somehow
Like I got 16 to 32 bars to rock it
But only 15% of profits ever see my pockets like
69 billion in the last 20 years
Spent on national defense but folks still live in fear like
Nearly half of America's largest cities is one-quarter black
That's why they gave Ricky Ross all the crack
16 ounces to a pound, 20 more to a key
A 5-minute sentence hearing and you're no longer free
40% of Americans own a cell phone
So they can hear everything that you say when you ain't home
I guess Michael Jackson was right: you are not alone
Rock your hardhat, black, 'cause you in the Terrordome
Full of hard niggas, large niggas, dice-tumblers
Young teens and prison greens facing life numbers
Crack mothers, crack babies and AIDS patients
Young bloods can't spell but they could rock you at PlayStation
This New Math is whipping motherfuckers' ass
You want to know how to rhyme you better learn how to add
It's mathematics


"The Mighty Mos Def"
"It's simple mathematics"
"Check it out"
"I revolve around science."
"What are we talking about here?"
"The Mighty Mos Def"
"It's simple mathematics"
"Check it out"
"I revolve around science."
"What are we talking about here?"
"Do your math, do your math"
"1, 2, 3, 4"
"What are we talking about here?"


Yo, it's 1 universal law but 2 sides to every story
3 strikes and you biddin' for life, mandatory
4 MCs murdered in the last 4 years
I ain't trying to be the 5th when the millennium is here
Yo it's 6 million ways to die, from the 7 deadly thrills
8-year-olds getting found with 9mils
It's 10 PM, where your seeds at? What's the deal?
He on the hill pumping krills to keep their bellies filled
Light in the ass with heavy steel, sights on the pretty shit in life
Young soldiers trying to earn their next stripe
When the average minimum wage is $5.15
You best believe you've got to find a new grind to get C.R.E.A.M
The white unemployment rate is nearly more than triple for black
Some front-liners got their gun in your back
Bubbling crack, jewel theft and robbery to combat poverty
And end up in the global jail economy
Stiffer stipulations attached to each sentence
Budget cutbacks but increased police presence
And even if you get out of prison still living
Join the other 5 million under state supervision
This is business: no faces, just lines and statistics
From your phone, your Zip Code to SSI digits
The system break man, child, and women into figures
2 columns for "Who is" and "Who ain't niggas"
Numbers is hard and real and they never have feelings
But you push too hard, even numbers got limits
Why did one straw break the camel's back?
Here's the secret
The million other straws underneath it
It's all mathematics (math)

"The Mighty Mos Def"
"It's simple mathematics"
"Check it out"
"I revolve around science."
"What are we talking about here?"
"The Mighty Mos Def"
"It's simple mathematics"
"Check it out"
"I revolve around science."
"What are we talking about here?"
"Do your math, do your math"
"1, 2, 3, 4"
"What are we talking about here?"

You came along, unexpectedly
I was doing fine in my little world
Oh baby please don't get me wrong
'Cause I'm not complaining
But you see, you got my mind spinning

Why can't it be
Why can't it be the two of us
Why can't we be lovers
Only friends
You came along
At a wrong place, at a wrong time
Or was it me

Baby I dream of you every minute
You're in my dreams
You're always in it
That's the only place I know
Where you could be mine
And I'm yours but only
Till I wake up

Why can't it be
Why can't it be the two of us
Why can't we be lovers
Only friends
You came along
At a wrong place, at a wrong time
Or was it me

That's the only place I know
Where you could be mine
And I'm yours but only
Till I wake up

Why can't it be
Why can't it be the two of us
Why can't we be lovers
Only friends
You came along
At a wrong place, at a wrong time
You came along
At a wrong place, at a wrong time
Or was it me

Why can't it be
---------------------------------------------------
Ho lasciato troppi segni
Sulla pelle gia strappata
Non c'e niente che si insegni prima
Che non l'hai provata
Sono andato sempre dritto come un treno
Ho cercato nel conflitto
La parvenza di un sentiero
Ho sempre fatto tutto in un modo solo mio
E non ho mai detto resta se potevo dire addio
Poche volte ho dato ascolto a chi dovevo dare retta
Ma non ne ho tenuto conto
Sempre avuto troppa fretta

Almeno tu rimani fuori
Dal mio diario degli errori
Da tutte le mie contraddizioni
Da tutti i torti e le ragioni
Dalle paure che convivono con me
Dalle parole di un discorso inutile
Almeno tu rimani fuori
Dal mio diario degli errori

Ho giocato con il fuoco
E qualcuna l'ho anche vinta
Ma ci e mancato poco
Mi giocassi anche la vita
Ho lasciato troppe volte
La mia impronta sopra un letto
Senza preoccuparmi troppo
Di cosa prima avevo detto
Ho guardato nell'abisso di un mattino senza alba
Senza avere un punto fisso
O qualcuno che ti salva

Ma almeno tu rimani fuori
Dal mio diario degli errori
Da tutte le mie contraddizioni
Da tutte le mie imperfezioni
Dalle paure che convivono con me
Dalle parole di un discorso inutile
Almeno tu rimani fuori
Dal mio diario degli errori

Almeno tu
Almeno tu
Almeno tu rimani fuori
Dal mio diario degli errori
---------------------------------------------------
What would it take
To make you love me?
What would it take
To make you love me?

Would it take flowers
Red roses from vines
Would it take diamonds
To let you know you're mine
Well, I'll take you dancing
Sweep you off your feet
What do you need
To know you're the only one, one for me

And what would it take
To make you love me?
What would it take
To make you love me?

What words can I say?
Tell me, what can I do?
Know that I am
And I'll give it to you
I could make you smile
Give you all your dreams
And I'd give everything
To make you love me
Oh, and

What would it take
To make you love me?
And what would it take
To make you love me?
Oh, what would it take?
What would it take?
It take
To make you love me?

Lass uns starten,
Samstagabend (oh,

Fais voir tes fesses
J'veux un gros plan pendant que je fume ma premiere presse
On etait rien on est devenus les Princes de la Ville comme 113
Tu parles beaucoup sur le net, j'espere pouvoir te rencontrer
T'imagines pas tout c'qu'on a du affronter, dix heures du mat' sur l'rrain-te
Il me faut des nouvelles Nike les miennes passeront pas l'hiver
Ma mere pleure tous les jours ca fait deux ans qu'elle paye plus ce putain de loyer
Pour un entretien c'est mort, nique tous ses morts, la putain d'ses morts
J'traine quelques remords
Meme ta mere nous jalouse elle essaye d'nous jeter un sort
Le rap c'est un sport, on est dans l'jeu, on est dangereux
J'ai fait le pour et le contre, plus d'argent que d'amis ouais
C'est ca l'enjeu, j'remercie Dieu, j'suis pas chanceux
J'suis pas comme eux, moi aussi j'suis QLF
Ma famille seulement pour te laisser en PLS
J'coupe la plaque, j'ecoute l'album Reve de Rue de TLF
Et j'roule un te3 avec les miettes
J'traine avec des renois j'mange du tiep
A chaque anniversaire, j'fais pas la fete
Mes habits sont sales, frerots j'fais tiep

Seul Dieu m'arrete j'ai le power ouais
Princesse goute a ce champagne-shower
Fragile est l'amour, solide est la peur
Je serais mort a t'ecouter petit hater
Depuis petit j'ai connu que le darwa
Association d'malfaiteurs, crime organise, darwa
Yeah, yeah j'peux mourir demain
Yeah, yeah j'peux mourir demain

Y'a de l'alcool y'a des bitches y'a du produit
C'est Katrina Squad qui produit
Meme moi je sais plus qui je suis
Une graine de rockstar ou un OG ?
J'suis en independant
J'me gere comme un patron ouais j'ai du repondant
J'te fais croquer t'es toujours pas content
Demain tu parles a mon repondeur
A l'ecole j'ai perdu mon temps, j'ai rate l'diplome
J'la calcule pas cette folle
Tu parles sur moi tu fais foye
Quand j'pense a eux je rigole
J'suis dans la zone, comme d'hab'
J'suis tout pres du four, comme d'hab'
Tu m'racontes ta vie, j'm'en tape
Ouais, ouais, j'm'en tape
On arrive on est tarpin, ca parle meme plus
Elle ecarte hun, VGS tu connais l'cartel
J'sens plus la pauvrete je sens le Pierre Cardin
J'suis dans la zone, comme d'hab'
J'suis tout pres du four, comme d'hab'
Tu m'racontes ta vie, j'm'en tape
Ouais, ouais, j'm'en tape

Seul Dieu m'arrete j'ai le power ouais
Princesse goute a ce champagne-shower
Fragile est l'amour, solide est la peur
Je serais mort a t'ecouter petit hater
Depuis petit j'ai connu que le darwa

Reveil plutot matinal
Je faisais un reve : des billets mauves tombaient du ciel
Je suis sur l'terrain, de bon matin
J'ai pas eu la carriere d'Anthony Martial
Serre-moi un verre de champagne on est libres
Generation 90, finie l'epoque des VR6
On a des Mercedes, quatre roues motrices
Marginal, 'zin, avec des Margiela
On va faire un paquet d'oseille
S'offrir une retraite loin de la
On part en vacances pour faires exces
Vous m'avez brise l'cúur, vous m'avez vexe
Si je t'ai fait du mal pardonne-moi
Ouais, j'ai surement pas fait expres

MC tu rappes bien
Mais toi et moi on ne fera jamais un feat
Dans ton studio ca pue l'hypocrisie
Ta position dans l'rap est plutot critique
Tout est bon pour faire du fric
Ouais, faut faire du chiffre
Plan rentable a faire en shit
J'suis dans l'game tout baigne j'fais des switch
Elle a une annonce sur VivaStreet
Toute la nuit elle enchaine les clins'
Sa tete est mise a prix
Il ne reviendra pas, il est dans les iles
Y'a des hippies, c'est Woodstock
Y'a des junkies, c'est Woodstock

Des larmes plein le visage, j'tire dans le mile
Personne ne pourra apaiser nos douleurs
On a vu quelques horreurs, on vient de Woodstock
Bienvenue a Woodstock
On a vecu dans la precarite comme a Woodstock
La vie c'est Bloodsburgh

Eh, eh Kaku
Merci pour cette prod' gigantesque

'Zin, c'est pas la chute qui compte, c'est l'atterrissage
Tu rappes mal ton album est perissable
Elle a les couilles de Mendoza Theresa
Pour un rien ca te sort un Beretta
On a fait des billets, ils ont dormi, ils ont fait des triples
On a grandi sans reperes, on sait gerer les affaires
Le 'zin je peux te faire une passe a ras-de-terre
Benefice et viles-ci, 'zin, la muerta ou tchitchi
Le Sheytan s'habille en Gucci
Tout est premedite, tu vas finir comme Lady Di
J'defends mes rheyous comme Mendy
J'ai RDV avec Sbah apres minuit
On l'a fait nous-memes, je l'ai fait seul
Je te fais mieux l'amour que lui, vas-y dis-lui


Je t'ai vu defonce, comment est-ce possible ?
T'es tombe dans l'hero'
Ecoute la Peuf, j't'emmene dans ma putain d'melo
Que des grosses cailles-ra dans l'tieks igo

J'ai paye la dot, j'recupere ma beaute
Peufra sur la casquette mec c'est brode
Y'a pas qu'moi qui mange, mon pote vient d'roter
Ca bibi taga dans l'trou et devant le D
Trouve-moi dans ma rue ou Marseille tu sais
J'suis dans l'VGS, dans l'vagin et tu saignes
J'suis toujours le meme, le Jack et le Miel
Chaque semaine gros t'as vu ou ca nous mene
Bebe reviens je faisais l'idiot
J'ai peur de Dieu, j'veux pas qu'on m'idolatre
Avant d'niquer ta reum attend j'tire deux lattes
La j'suis sous rhum et j'suis pas adorable
Le rap mon serum, faut pas que j'me rate
C'est pour mes rats, mes gars qui se font rares

J'suis avec le zin autour d'une chicha raisin
J'appelle mon cousin, j'lui demande de descendre
Elle a trop tise, elle me fait remarquer
Elle fait que tmeniker, j'lui demande de s'detendre
J'suis sur l'bitume, petit polo Prestance
J'titube, il est 13h petante
J'prends ma petite, j'l'emmene sur un port de Plaisance
Poches remplies, j'profite de ce moment de detente
Tchok a 50, liasses de 50
Ta gadji coute pas cher, meme pas 50
L'argent vient vite, mon cousin, il part vite
La con de sa tante, t'facon j'vais mourir avant 50
L'avenir est a nous faut tout niquer maintenant
Faut tout niquer maintenant
Un peu d'Givenchy, un peu d'Versace
Quelques Lacoste, quelques Lieutenant

A trop faire du sale la street m'en redemande
De quoi tu parles, t'es personne aucune redevance
Tu nous connais, tu connais notre provenance
T'entends parler d'mon equipe dans La Provence
A trop faire du sale la street m'en redemande
De quoi tu parles, t'es personne aucune redevance
Tu nous connais, tu connais notre provenance
T'entends parler d'mon equipe dans La Provence

J'ai change d'voiture
Y a meme pas deux ans ma 'ture coutait meme pas le prix de un d'mes vetements
Retiens qu'une chose, pour nous 70
Tu nous fais l'blinde, tu touches 9%
J'ai grimpe quelques etapes, sans piston
Chicos petes, les yeux petes
J'te vois tourner dans la zone avec ta vieille caisse que ta salope t'a pretee
J'ai la haine, j'ai la haine
Sortir un titre, tourner un clip, frerot, j'ai la flemme
Hier ca tirait devant l'bar
J'suis rentre tard, j'me suis reveille tard
J'recompte ma part, j'fume un petard
J'regarde son petard, frerot j'me regale

A trop faire du sale la street m'en redemande

Tu nous connais, tu connais notre provenance
T'entends parler d'mon equipe dans La Provence

T'es qu'un gros mytho
Personne ne te connait dans ton barrio
Au feu ce fou furieux veut qu'on s'tire la bourre
J'suis pas mal emeche, j'veux pas finir a l'Eveche pour un controle de papiers
Des billets eparpilles, tu connais l'equipe, le square est quadrille
Dans la cave j'en ai un, il en reste que deux dans l'barillet
J'aime trop mon tieks, j'passe tout mon temps a faire croquer les minots d'la tess
Quel honneur, j'vois leurs yeux briller

A trop faire du sale la street m'en redemande
De quoi tu parles, t'es personne aucune redevance

J'te raconte beaucoup d'salade, j'consomme beaucoup d'salade
J'veux mourir en paix, j'veux mourir millionnaire
Petit j'voyais les choses en grand, j'etais plutot visionnaire
J'suis a l'ancienne, comme ta hlel, comme la position du missionnaire
Mon tel' est eteint j'dois remonter il me reste la vie entiere

J'avoue j'ai deconne

Monologue sur l'repondeur, ouais

J'avoue j't'ai menti, apres tout j'suis qu'un Homme

T'as craque, qu'est-c't'as ? Tu m'harceles
Les freres mus' me me font l'rappel
J'vais au hanout j'cache l'alcool dans un sac poubelle
On est des bonhommes on mene la grande vie
Prepare-toi, fais-toi toute belle
Tu m'connais j'fume que d'la frappe
J'ai trop de choses a retenir, il me faut une secretaire
Tu craques, tu vas partir, tu vas plus revenir
Et j't'ai mis une chaise pour la enieme fois
Cache une arme et d'l'argent dans les bois
J'suis encore bourre, j'ai oublie d'penser a toi
Train d'vie malhonnete, on est hors-la-loi

J'avoue j'ai deconne
J'lui ai mis une chaise pour la enieme fois

J'arrive dans le secteur, le frere m'a donne R.D.V
Journee noire, le jobbeur vient tout juste de se faire peter
J'suis avec les kho au cafe le soleil tape sur ma graine de cafe
J'ai mal dormi, ils m'ont sorti de l'hotel a midi, frero je suis fache
Vas-y parle pas trop au phone, elle ment je la connais pas cette folle
J'arrive en showcase en short, je ne serre pas la main a ces fiottes
Le soleil tape fort, tous les jours je pense a faire un milli
Je la regarde passer dans sa Mini, je suis pete sous Vodka, Martini
Et lui il parle beaucoup, il a la boco, c'est un farceur, c'est un gros mytho
Croise moi dans la rue avec niss-gro, cale dans la gov'
Boulox est la, la misere on l'oublie vite, pete sous poliakov

Hier on etait pauvre, ca ira mieux demain
Parti de rien, finir bandit de grand chemin
J'ai touche le fond, ils m'ont meme pas tendu la main
Le tchok a 50, le gramme a 80
Je suis dans le barrio, barrio
Je suis dans le barrio, barrio
Je suis dans le barrio, barrio
Je suis dans le barrio

Je sors devant l'block, et j'roule un perso
J'ai pas pris son num, je m'en souviens plus ou j'avais plus de reseau
Liasse de violet dans la chapang mais je vais la soulever pour pas un
Je m'ennuie je fais passer le temps au quartier
Soiree qui finit mal au casin'
Je roule un cone la dose est chargee
Sale conne tu me prends la tete
J'aime bien les soirees posees
J'aime pas trop faire la fete
On les connait ils ont la haine
Autrefois ils me faisaient de la peine
Elle veut que j'aille la chercher vers 20h
En vrai, frero j'ai vraiment la flemme
Mon collegue s'est fait peter
Il voulait se refaire avant l'ete
J'en ai marre de trainer en bas
Marre de les regarder jouer les zampas
J'ai pose toute la nuit au studio
Y a plus de vovo fallait me le dire plus tot
4 rebeux capuches dans l'auto
Elles aiment les gros salops, les gros locos

Hier on etait pauvre, ca ira mieux demain
Parti de rien, finir bandit de grand chemin
J'ai touche le fond, ils m'ont meme pas tendu la main
Le tchok a 50, le gramme a 80
Je suis dans le barrio, barrio
Je suis dans le barrio, barrio
Je suis dans le barrio, barrio
Je suis dans le barrio

Ich laufe auf Treibsand
Du malst dir 'n Bild meiner Welt und denkst, dass ichs leicht hab
Denn je mehr Leute Horen, desto werden meine Worte nur leiser
Und du malst dir 'n Bild meiner Welt und denkst, dass ichs leicht hab
Dabei lauf ich auf Treibsand

Ist nicht leicht, wenn dir jeder zuguckt, ha
Doch davon die Halfte dir nicht mal zuhort, haha
Erst mal machen sie dich groﬂ auf YouTube
Und am Ende wollen sie, dass du dann das weiﬂe Tuch wirfst
Ich denk an den Tod von Opa
Gott helf den kranken und denen die hungern
Denn mein Bruders Bruder liegt seit uber zehn Jahren im Koma
Es gab so Phasen Bruder
Mama hatte zwei Jobs, dennoch blieb ihr nur 'n Hunni fur den ganzen Monat
Du hast unterschrieben, Leute erwarten so viel
Kein' Plan B, nur Plan A war die Musik
Ich habs mir aufgebaut, ich wurde nicht zu 'nem Star gemacht
Nicht mal mit dem Vorschuss konnte ich Mamas Schulden abbezahlen
Ffff, ja, ich bin nur ehrlich
Brauch nur loyale Bruder Homie, mehr nicht
Treibsand, ja, mein Weg ist gefahrlich
Hast gerade angefangen und sie machen dich fertig
Wie kannst du urteilen ohne mich zu kenn'
Willst den Menschen uber ein Buch erzahlen, was du selber nicht gelesen hast
Tut mir leid, doch du V-Mann bist hier fehl am Platz
Bau keine Verbindungen mit Menschen wie dir auf, als ob ich kein WLAN hab
Shit, zu Hause ist es kalt jeden Tag
Doch ich lach, damit Paps oder Mama nichts ahnt
Hab die Hoffnung an Liebe verloren, als ich vor Mamas leeren Schrank saﬂ
Und gesehen hab, dass Baba zu jeder Uhrzeit wach war
Haaa, alles kalt, kalt, kalt
Alles wird bald, bald, bald
Ich kann und wills nicht jedem gerecht machen
Aber nur falls du etwas sagst
Denn deine hohen Erwartungen, die du hast, sind Lasten auf meinen Schultern, die ich nicht tragen kann, also bitte erspar dir das
Mann, lass mich machen, was ich will, solang ich niemanden verletz
Ich glaube, das ware jedem gerecht

Bruder immer wenn Regen fallt, erwarte nichts, auﬂer das du mich Leben lasst
Deine Hand rutscht ab, Bruder, immer wenn Regen fallt
Auch das letzte funken Licht konnt in deiner Seele brennen
Ich bete, denn keiner sieht das ich

Ich laufe auf Treibsand
Du malst dir 'n Bild meiner Welt und denkst, dass ichs leicht hab
Denn je mehr Leute Horen, desto werden meine Worte nur leiser
Und du malst dir 'n Bild meiner Welt und denkst, dass ichs leicht hab
Dabei lauf ich auf Treibsand

Ich laufe auf Treibsand
Du malst dir 'n Bild meiner Welt und denkst, dass ichs leicht hab
Denn je mehr Leute Horen, desto werden meine Worte nur leiser
Und du malst dir 'n Bild meiner Welt und denkst, dass ichs leicht hab
Dabei lauf ich auf Treibsand

Tes ennemis t'baisent, tes amis t'baisent
Et les autres, bref, ils attendent la breche
J'pense de moi qu'j'suis vraiment cru, mais j'suis juste cruellement vrai
Toi l'banquier t'la mise dans l'cul, tu crois qu'le bonheur est dans l'pret
Elle te disait qu'elle t'aime, plus qu'elle ne s'aimait elle meme
C'est pas ce qui l'a líempeche d'se faire ken par un autre
Et tes soi-disant freres, quand t'as pris 6 ans ferme
Pas d'parlu, pas d'mandat pas un mot
T'essaies de les faire croquer, mais c'est toi qu'ils veulent manger
Faites pas les mecs choques le jour ou j'vais vraiment changer
J'ai l'cul du game a mon annulaire comme une putain d'alliance
Ils se demandent : "Pourquoi tant d'haine ?" Ils n'en comprennent pas l'sens

On se bluffe, on se bluffe, on se bluffe yeux dans yeux
On s'attire, on s'attache, mais on joue a un jeu dangereux
On se bluffe, on se bluffe, on se bluffe yeux dans yeux
Et puis on finit solo, et puis on finit solo

Au depart on achete les meubles, puis on deplace les meubles
On essaye d'sauver les meubles et un jour on s'partage les meubles
Soit c'est l'amour qui rend con, soit y'a qu'des cons qui tombent amoureux
Et j'me d'mande c'que ces gens font, j'crois qu'ils essayent tous d'etre heureux
Igo, remballe ton cúur d'eponge, j'ai troque l'mien contre un portefeuille
J'compte les loves je compte pas sur les gens, a la deception j'prefere l'orgueil
Y'a aucun lien imbrisable, pas meme l'amour d'un frere
Les gens se rendent compte de tout ce que tu fais, pour eux le jour ou tíarretes de le faire
Tu verras jamais d'arc-en-ciel sans un peu de pluie
Y'a pas d'lumiere, pas d'soleil plein sans un peu de nuit
Le jour du jugement dernier quel baveux tu vas appeler
Quand tu crois nager dans l'bonheur, reste la ou tu as pied

On se bluffe, on se bluffe, on se bluffe yeux dans yeux
On s'attire, on s'attache, mais on joue a un jeu dangereux
On se bluffe, on se bluffe, on se bluffe yeux dans yeux
Et puis on finit solo, et puis on finit solo

Solo
Solo
Solo
Solo
Et puis on finit solo
Solo
Et puis on finit solo
Solo

I wanna be your vacuum cleaner
Breathing in your dust
I wanna be your Ford Cortina
I will never rust
If you like your coffee hot
Let me be your coffee pot
You call the shots, babe
I just wanna be yours

Secrets I have held in my heart
Are harder to hide than I thought
Maybe I just wanna be yours
I wanna be yours, I wanna be yours
Wanna be yours, wanna be yours, wanna be yours

Let me be your 'leccy meter and I'll never run out
Let me be the portable heater that you'll get cold without
I wanna be your setting lotion (wanna be)
Hold your hair in deep devotion (how deep?)
At least as deep as the Pacific Ocean
I wanna be yours

Secrets I have held in my heart
Are harder to hide than I thought
Maybe I just wanna be yours
I wanna be yours, I wanna be yours
Wanna be yours, wanna be yours, wanna be yours
Wanna be yours, wanna be yours, wanna be yours
Wanna be yours, wanna be yours

I wanna be your vacuum cleaner (Wanna be yours)
Breathing in your dust (Wanna be yours)
I wanna be your Ford Cortina (Wanna be yours)
I will never rust (Wanna be yours)
I just wanna be yours (Wanna be yours)
I just wanna be yours (Wanna be yours)
I just wanna be yours (Wanna be yours)

It's you, it's always you
If I'm ever gonna fall in love, I know it's gon' be you
It's you, it's always you
Met a lot of people, but nobody feels like you
So please don't break my heart, don't tear me apart
I know how it starts, trust me, I've been broken before
Don't break me again, I am delicate
Please don't break my heart, trust me, I've been broken before

I've been broken, yeah, I know how it feels
To be open and then find out your love isn't real
I'm still hurting, yeah, I'm hurting inside
I'm so scared to fall in love, but if it's you, then I'll try

It's you, it's always you
If I'm ever gonna fall in love, I know it's gon' be you
It's you, it's always you
Met a lot of people, but nobody feels like you
So please don't break my heart, don't tear me apart
I know how it starts, trust me, I've been broken before
Don't break me again, I am delicate
Please don't break my heart, trust me, I've been broken before

I know I'm not the best at choosing lovers (Oh)
We both know my past speaks for itself (For itself)
If you don't think that we're right for each other (Baby, no)
Then please don't let history repeat itself
'Cause I want you, yeah, I want you, yeah
There's nothing else I want
'Cause I want you, yeah, I want you, yeah
And you're the only thing I want

It's you, it's always you
If I'm ever gonna fall in love, I know it's gon' be you
It's you, it's always you
Met a lot of people, but nobody feels like you
So please don't break my heart, don't tear me apart
I know how it starts, trust me, I've been broken before
Don't break me again, I am delicate
Please don't break my heart, trust me, I've been broken before

Baby, I want you, baby, I want you
Baby, I want you, baby, I want you
Baby, I want you, baby, I want you
You, you, 'cause I want you
Baby, I want you, baby, I want you
Baby, I want you, baby, I want you
Baby, I want you, baby, I want you
You, you
---------------------------------------------------
I loved you more than quite was good for me
I tried pretending nothing's wrong
You used to break me down with honesty
And now the honesty is gone
Still wrong, still wrong

So, let me just for once, let me dance to the music
You can't take that from me
Can I just for once, can I dance to the music?
You can't take that away
Can't steal the music

Can't steal the music

Last time I saw you it was dangerous
I gotta erase that part of mind
If it is bigger than the both of us
Why do I feel so small inside?
Still wrong, still wrong

So, let me just for once, let me dance to the music
You can't take that from me
Can I just for once, can I dance to the music?
You can't take that away
Can't steal the music

Can't steal the music
Can't steal the music
Can't steal the music

Still wrong, still wrong
Still feel like a coward
But if I saw, if I saw you now
It would be over, overpower

So, let me just for once, let me dance to the music
You can't take that from me
Can I just for once, can I dance to the music?
You can't take that away
Can't steal the music

Can't steal the music
Can't steal the music
Can't steal the music
Can't steal the music

Que bello es vivir
A mi me gusta cada cosa
Que la vida nos ofrece
El placer me reconforta
El dolor me fortalece
Disfruto cada segundo
Y cada segundo que viene
Cuando pienso que disfruto
Mas disfruto, es lo que tiene

Y como me gusta recrearme
Disfrutando de cualquier soplo de aire
Y como me alegro de encontrarme
Tan alegre, tan feliz, tan despreciable

Que bello es vivir
Cuando me asomo a la ventana
Y veo el mundo por la manana
A mi es que se me alegra el alma
Y tengo que sacar el cava
Para brindar por esta vida
Que esta tan bien fabricada
Y saco tambien el confeti
Y voy cantando por mi casa

Como me gusta recrearme
Disfrutando de cualquier soplo de aire
Y como me alegro de encontrarme
Tan alegre, tan feliz, tan despreciable

Que bello es vivir
Que lindo es amar
Yo te quiero a ti
Tu me quieres mas
Que bello es vivir
Que lindo es amar
Yo te quiero a ti
Tu me quieres mas

A cantar
Lara lara
Lara lara
Reir
Jaja jaji
Jaja jeji
A bailar
Muevelo pa'lli
Muevelo pa' lla

Aplaudir a dos manos, milagro, alegria
Por Dios, ni yo mismo me aguanto

Pero que bello es vivir
Aunque la vida me maltrate
De la forma mas espeluznante
Yo saldre cada dia a la calle
Con mi sonrisa mas grande

Y aunque nadie me soporte
Esta felicidad absurda
Y me echen de los bares
Y hasta mis padres me huyan
No es una rara enfermedad mental que todavia no se ha diagnosticado
Y no es el efecto de alguna cosita que yo sin querer me haya fumado

Que bello es vivir
Que lindo es amar
Yo te quiero a ti
Tu me quieres mas
Que bello es vivir
Que lindo es amar
Yo te quiero a ti
Tu me quieres mas

A cantar
Lara lara
Lara lara
Reir
Jaja jaji
Jaja jeji
A bailar
Muevelo pa'lli
Muevelo pa'lla

Aplaudir a dos manos, milagro, alegria
Por Dios, ni yo mismo me aguanto

Lara lara

Jaja jaji
Jaja jeji

Viva y bravo, "alegrida", ilusion
Que bonico es vivir
Si se os nota en la cara que estais deseando
Que acabe para hincharos de a...
Para hincharos de aplaudir

That's what happens when I get lost in my mind
That's what happens when I get lost in my mind

I'm going up the hill to watch the lights, the lights
Close my eyes to feel the boom, the boom
My legs hurt, I've been walking for so long
I feel I'm running out of the ground
Of the ground
Of the ground

That's what happens when I get lost in my mind
That's what happens when I get lost in my mind

My pockets are empty, I've been robbed by the streets
That shine gold, busy, and cold when I'll be there
I feel so alone in this city
Looking for your heart when the streets are empty
When the streets are empty
When the streets are empty

That's what happens when I get lost in my mind
That's what happens when I get lost in my mind

Midnight sunshine, it's your smile, I'm going crazy
Spread the words I painted in red and follow the thread
We'll find our path, find our path
When we kiss it'll come to us
To us
It'll come to us

Don't get lost in your mind
Don't get lost in your mind
Oh, don't get lost in your mind
Don't get lost in your mind

Put my codeine in the freezer, smoking on this Nimbus cloud
Twin glocks, Gohan Krillin, nigga, but I am not kidding 'round
Put a Halo on my head when I hit her in the spirit realm
Fat nigga, Majin Buu I'm eating, never gave a fuck

She let me, run shit, she let me

She let me
Run shit

She stick her tongue out, look back and spell run
She just wanna have fun, she so sick and tired of love

Fifty shades of red in my bed, I'm like drugs
She a sex addict fiend and she'll even fuck the plug (And That's me)
She know if she want it she can get it baby, anytime
I be racing' to that pussy, bet I hit the finish line
Big ass Draco for the rookies, bet that I'ma finish slime
My little bitch don't need your ten cents, nigga, 'cause she's been a dime
I was in the hood the other day, that shit like Vietnam
These niggas on the other side lookin' in, they like some peepin' toms
You can hit the bitch one time, then you in love
I'd hit that bitch one time, then I'd be done
Shawty looked me in my eyes and sucked the end of my gun
That moment forward, I knew she was the one
Bills to the ceilin', she won't pick up them ones
She my super villain, kill them bitches for fun
Hella smoke in the air, faded dope in my lungs
Put my fangs in her neck, now she can't feel the sun

She let me

Hop out a GT3 with an MP5

Always thought impossible
Break the chains of life
What I fought for every day
Could finally come alive
Whatever dreams I longed for
I strove for to defend
Whatever hope that's there for me
Will stay there to the end

There's no trace of yesterday examining my faith
See a starlit hallway for the future I create
Before the darkness gets me I will spread my wings and fly
I transcend from the chaos and the darkness turns to light

This is the time
For chasing my desires
What's in my heart is true
And if my dreams set everything on fire
Then I would still belong to you

I never doubt the feelings that I had
Could bring me through
And every teardrop leaving me
Was leaving me for you

If all my instincts screamed to me
And tried to guide me through
Would I long for an eternity
Or just come back to you

This is the time
For chasing my desires
What's in my heart is true
And if my dreams set everything on fire
Then I would still belong to you

What I can dream
Scream
It's possible
But it will turn
Burn
Keep it real
Trust your dreams
And soon you'll stand here next to me

This is the time
For chasing my desires
What's in my heart is true
And if my dreams set everything on fire
Then I would still belong to you

This is the time
For chasing my desires
What's in my heart is true
And if my dreams set everything on fire
Then I would still belong to you

Legends fail
And houses fall
In great shame
In elliptical ruins

A king gouges his eyes out
Forbidden love takes poison

Tragedies repeat themselves
In perfect circle
In perfect circle
Wrong, wrong, wrong
Wrong, wrong, wrong
Wrong, wrong, wrong
(As in death) wrong, wrong, wrong
(As in death)

As Colossus stands
So shall Rome
When Colossus falls
Rome shall fall
When Rome falls

As Colossus stands
So shall Rome
When Colossus falls
Rome shall fall
When Rome falls
So falls the world

Some people don't know when to quit and that's why they quit
Some need to hit the bottom to see they got a problem, they can't handle it
But that ain't why I started cleaning up my life
Wish it was but, ooh, that would be a lie

I've been sober 'cause there ain't no hangover like you girl, no, no, no
Baby can you come over, I always find those words at the bottom of a hundred proof, yeah
Girl, every time you do
I just end up, head all messed up like the sheets where we made love
I've been sober since you broke my heart in two
'Cause drunk me can't get over you (there ain't no hangover like you)
Can't get over, can't get over (there ain't no hangover like you)
Oh, no, no, no

All those bottles sitting up on the shelf are just salt on the wound
One sip and I'm picking up the phone trying not to go home without you
And that ain't nothing but a whole lotta pain
And that kind of hurt, ooh hurts, it ain't worth another drink

I've been sober 'cause there ain't no hangover like you girl, no, no, no
Baby, can you come over, I always find those words at the bottom of a hundred proof, yeah-yeah
Girl, every time you do
I just end up, head all messed up like the sheets where we made love
I've been sober since you broke my heart in two
'Cause drunk me can't get over you... no
Can't get over you, oh, no, no, no
I've been sober 'cause there ain't no hangover like you, no, no, no

Can you come over
I always find those words at the bottom of a hundred proof, yeah-yeah
Girl, every time you do
I just end up, head all messed up like the sheets where we made love
I've been sober since you broke my heart in two
'Cause drunk me, yeah drunk me, yeah drunk me
Can't get over you (there ain't no hangover like you)
Can't get over, can't get over (there ain't no hangover like you), oh, no, no, no
---------------------------------------------------
The only thing I ever wanted, the only thing I ever needed
Is my own way - I gotta have it all
I don't want your opinion, I don't need your ideas
Stay the fuck out of my face, stay away from me
I am my god - I do as I please

Just wipe your own ass and - shut your mouth

I had enough and you're going down - shut your mouth
What comes around you know goes around

My mind is playing tricks on me
I am not as stable as I used to be
Pushed and shoved, you know you're going too far
I will not break my back for you no more, I am gonna go my way
I am gonna take control
Time to wake up and dig myself out of this hell

Just wipe your own ass and - shut your mouth

I had enough and you're going down - shut your mouth
What comes around you know goes around - shut your mouth
You're getting what your ego deserves - shut your mouth
What comes around you know goes around - shut your mouth

Shut your mouth

I had enough and you're going down - shut your mouth
What comes around you know goes around

Shut your mouth
Shut your mouth
Shut your mouth
---------------------------------------------------
It's a mystery to me
We have a greed with which we have agreed
And you think you have to want more than you need
Until you have it all, you won't be free

Society, you're a crazy breed
I hope you're not lonely without me

When you want more than you have, you think you need
And when you think more than you want, your thoughts begin to bleed
I think I need to find a bigger place
Cause when you have more than you think, you need more space

Society, you're a crazy breed
I hope you're not lonely without me
Society, crazy indeed
Hope you're not lonely without me

There's those thinking more or less, less is more
But if less is more, how you keepin score?
Means for every point you make your level drops
Kinda like you're startin' from the top
And you can't do that

Society, you're a crazy breed
I hope you're not lonely without me
Society, crazy indeed
I hope you're not lonely without me
Society, have mercy on me
I hope you're not angry if I disagree
Society, you're crazy indeed
I hope you're not lonely without me

Qu'ils arretent de faire la street c'est presque tous des vendus (wooh)
Si j'ai le sens du commerce c'est grace a la drogue que j'ai vendu (wooh)
Coupable de coups bas, he, de coups tordus dans la ue-r (dans la ue-r)
Tu parles de mon batiment la planque, t'inquietes que ca carbure (ca carbure mon pote)
J'suis dans l'Rap, j'suis pas dans l'mouvement (nan), j'suis pas d'accord avec le gouvernement (ah nan)
Untouchable republiqua, j'en ai rien a foutre de votre president
Comme toi j'ai mis cagoule et les gants, personne pour te faire quer-cro, tu te debrouilles comme un grand (wooh)
On connait la street et ses manigances (ouais), j'aurai pu crever mille fois quand j'y pense (ouais)
J'demande pardon dans mes invocations, affaires vous concernant dans mes convocations
Je marque un but dans la prochaine occasion, enferme je sais que tu reves d'evasion
Retour d'vacances, t'as perdu ton terrain, ramollis par les thunes, t'es plus assez tare
Dans l'secteur t'es pas seul a jouer les parrains, sur-arme sur une becane qui vient de demarrer
J'veux mes sous j'm'en fous de ta retraite (ouais), j'suis pas ton esclave j'investis dans mon bled (ah nan ca)
J'veux mes sous j'm'en fous de ta retraite, j'suis pas ton esclave j'investis dans mon bled (ah)
J'ai des amis que j'ai perdu d'vue (oui) a cause d'une cavale, d'une karna, d'une rafale
J'vois ces anciens qui n'ont plus d'thunes, qui s'disent "Socrate t'es phenomenal"
Ceux qui m'ecoutent on fait du sale, ceux qui m'ecoutent sont des sportifs ambitieux
Ceux qui m'ecoutent se tuent la tache au travail, y'a pas de sot metier messieurs
Que tu detailles ou qu't'envoies ca en gros, Iblis prend plaisir a chahuter mes proches
Que tu detailles ou qu't'envoies ca en gros, pourquoi tu veux savoir combien j'ai dans les poches ?
Je pris le Tout-Puissant a cote des RG, la mode dans la street c'est d'faire comme les pede'
Comme l'homme araignee qui sent venir le danger, des grandes douleurs obscurcissent ceux qui veulent nous juger
J'ai ternis mon enfance, je pleure mes printemps, demain c'est maintenant
Untouchable vous pourrez dire aux autres que le General est dans le Rap et le vetement
Je suis simple, complique a la fois (he), gentil et mechant a la fois (he)
C'est souvent la femme qui t'aimes que tu decois (he)
Il etait une fois dans mon 9.3, never change, never change, mon negro t'assures (ah)
La musique c'est rien vous prenez pas la tete, prenez exemple sur Gradur
Il federe comme jamais avec des bonnes vibrations (he, he)
Banger partie 3 pour ma celebration (oui oui, si si)
Mets le game a quatre pattes avant la penetration (he, he)
Allez dire a toutes ces putes que j'aime trop la fellation (he, he) (oui oui, si si)

Dans ce Rap game, dans ce Rap game
Le loup solitaire se balade dans ce Rap game, dans ce Rap game
Si j'continue c'est pour faire hommage a mon frere, dans ce Rap game
Le loup solitaire se balade dans ce Rap game, dans ce Rap game
Le loup solitaire se balade dans ce Rap game, dans ce Rap game
Si j'continue c'est pour faire hommage a mon frere, dans ce Rap game

Quien diria que estaria la situacion
Pero saber a quien yo darle el corazon
Entre la espada y la pared me encuentro yo
Sin decidir con cual me quedo de las dos

Como un loco desquiciado
Indeciso, enamorado
Es que ya no puedo ocultarlo
Una es fuego en la cama
La otra complementa mi alma
Es que ya no puedo aguantarlo

Es un dilema complicado
De las dos estoy asfixiado
Que puedo hacer si las dos a mi me gustan
Mirenme desesperado
Ando muy desorientado
Que puedo hacer si las dos a mi me gustan

Es un dilema complicado
De las dos estoy asfixiado
Que puedo hacer si las dos a mi me gustan
Mirenme desesperado
Ando muy desorientado
Que puedo hacer si las dos a mi me gustan

Y ahora como salgo de la situacion
Si soy humano y me vence la tentacion
Y ha cambiado mi sentido, mi razon

Como un loco desquiciado
Indeciso, enamorado
Es que ya no puedo ocultarlo
Una es fuego en la cama
La otra complementa mi alma
Es que ya no puedo aguantarlo

Es un dilema complicado
De las dos estoy asfixiado
Que puedo hacer si las dos a mi me gustan
Mirenme desesperado
Ando muy desorientado
Que puedo hacer si las dos a mi me gustan

Es un dilema complicado
De las dos estoy asfixiado
Que puedo hacer si las dos a mi me gustan
Mirenme desesperado
Ando muy desorientado
Que puedo hacer si las dos a mi me gustan

Que puedo hacer, yo no se...
Duermo con una y la otra esta llamandome
Suplicandome que vaya
Que me extrana en su cama
Y no se que puedo hacer
Duermo con una y la otra esta llamandome
Suplicandome que vaya
Que me extrana en su cama
Y no se que puedo hacer
Duermo con una y la otra esta llamandome
---------------------------------------------------
I went to a place
To repair and rest myself
But I never managed
The loop of the waves
Crashing on my shore got stuck in my head
And never got out

Oh, it'd be better if the world would all slow down
It'd be better if I knew what I know now
It'd be better if the world would all slow down
It'd be better if the world would all slow down
It'd be better if I was swimming in the shallows
'Cause then I wouldn't be just spending my whole life
Catching up to you

But I held a seashell
Close to my ear
I listened
To the sound of the sea
It made me swear
An oath of secrecy
I couldn't tell a soul what it told me

Oh, it'd be better if the world would all slow down
It'd be better if I knew what I know now
It'd be better if the world would all slow down
It'd be better if the world would all slow down
It'd be better if I was swimming in the shallows
It'd be better if the world would all slow down
It'd be better if I was swimming in the shallows
It'd be better if I was swimming in the shallows
The shallows
The shallows

It made me swear
An oath of secrecy
I couldn't tell a soul what it told me, no
I can't tell you what it told me, no
I can't tell you what it told me, no
I can't tell you what it told me, no
I can't tell you what it told me, no
I can't tell you what it told me, no
I can't tell you what it told me
I can't tell you what it told me
I can't tell you what it told me
I can't tell you what it told me
I can't tell you what it told me, no
---------------------------------------------------
I know there are some things
About you I don't know
So many so many sides we
Haven't seen
If we get the chance to be alone, baby
So much so much that I would
Like to know

Show me you're the way
Show me the right way
Show me, love me
See me, perfectly
Show me, Show me...

I don't I don't know how to
Behave, baby
When you see that you had me
All along

I want to feel
I want to feel

Show me you're the one
Show me you're my only

Show me you're the way
Show me the right way
Show me, love me
See me, perfectly
Show me, Show me...
---------------------------------------------------
And here we all were, believing you would live forever
You were always there, you built the foundation together
It was your vision, your talent and your dedication
Behind the reason why you went on to shake the nations

Now your shoes can't be filled, it's all quiet and still
We just can't believe that you're gone

Thank God for Starman and Motorhead
Indelible heroes
The new kid in town in the purple rain
Indelible heroes
What's there to fill the void?
Pretty much nothing, nothing, nothing
Pretty much nothing, nothing, nothing

Life in the fast lane brought you both pleasure and pain
So much to gain and much to lose just the same

And now your shoes can't be filled, it's all quiet and still
We just can't believe that you're gone

Thank God for Starman and Motorhead
Indelible heroes
The new kid in town in the purple rain
Indelible heroes
What's there to fill the void?
Pretty much nothing, nothing, nothing
Pretty much nothing, nothing, nothing

Thank God for Starman and Motorhead
Indelible heroes
The new kid in town in the purple rain
Indelible heroes

Thank God for Starman and Motorhead
Indelible heroes
The new kid in town in the purple rain
Indelible heroes
What's there to fill the void?
Pretty much nothing, nothing, nothing
Pretty much nothing, nothing, nothing
Pretty much nothing, nothing, nothing
Pretty much nothing, nothing, nothing

But tell me, can you hit it right?
'Cause if I let you in tonight
You better put it da-da-down da-da-down

Now we're through with all the talk

Tell each other how we feel
But, baby, know I love the thrill
When you put it da-da-down da-da-down

I'm alright on my own
But with you I'm in the zone
One shot, don't let it go
You better put it da-da-down da-da-down

Make me say you the one I like, like, like, like
Come put your body on mine, mine, mine, mine
Keep it up all night, night, night, night
Don't let me down da-da-down

All night give me mad love

Hein
L'album arrive les srabs
Vous etes pas prets
On charbonne ca comme des chinois mon pote
Ahah

Lorenzo debarque foutre la merde
On saccage la baraque, on va fumer votre herbe
Briquet devant mon cul, j'crache le feu comme un dragon
On a pimpe ta meuf, sous ses fesses y a des neons !
J'suis le grand frere de Pascal le grand frere
Ce soir, j'suis de garde, j'ai des tres bons somniferes
Aux quatre coins de la France, y a des traces de mon me-sper
J'les fais fumer pour les faire taire
Mamene mamene, j'porte un 'sky a tous mes srabs
Et toutes les plus cocasses qui viennent nous sucer sous la table
J'suis le grand mechant loup qui fait peur dans les fables
J'ai 86 enfants et 132 femmes
Y a pas de cours d'magie donc j'vais pas a la fac
Ma bite wingardium devant Emma Watson
Pas tres Charlie, celle-la faut qu'tu la backes
Les rappeurs s'inclinent, Tupac m'a demande pardon
Avale, avale ; c'est riche en Omega-3
Cavale, cavale sur mon cheval de Troie
On drague les pucelles avec du Passoa
J'suis la pour piquer les beurettes de Booba
J'l'ai larguee mais on peut toujours baiser
J'fais des periscopes plus sales que Serge Aurier
J'ai nique la súur de la mere de ta cousine
J'ai nique la súur de la mere de ta cousine
J'veux mater le foot, elle veut manger mon foutre
J'aime les sports de baise et de combat
J'suis deshydrate, mamene, j'ejacule en poudre
Il y a ceux qui m'aiment et ceux qui t'aiment pas
J't'envoie ta commande par pigeon voyageur
T'inquiete, ils sont sous coke, ca arrive dans l'quart d'heure
Desole la miss, le sexe est baladeur
N'oublie jamais que, du sale, je suis l'empereur
Dans l'Hit Machine, j'viens rajouter un tube
On zappe tous tes sons, comme si c'etait la pub
Un verre a la patte, tu peux m'appeler rouge-gorge
A l'ecole, c'etait moi qui venais donner les ordres
Une au bout de la queue et l'autre au bout du fil
J'les fourre a la chaine comme un chinois a l'usine
Tu charbonnes des grosses, vas-y, tu m'fais d'la peine
J'ai ecrit l'album et record en deux semaines

Heiiiiiiiiin
Est-ce que t'es toujours debout, mamene ?
Ou mon freestile t'a mis a terre ?
Eh, retourne couler des grosses D, espece de drogue !
On est la pour pervertir la jeunesse

Big sacrifices in my life, it's worth it (It's worth it)

It was worth losing my friends, gaining more enemies
It was worth losing myself, I'm the one killing me
It was worth turning that "No" straight to a "Yes, indeed!
It was worth sayin' "Fuck everyone who ain't believe in me
Oh, there you go hating me, why don't you get rid of me?
Asking me if it's worth it, when you see the papers all here
Got big stones, got big racks 'round here
My real niggas, smokin' big blunts 'round here

High as the line gets her better credit card cuts,
So in love with the scene, uh,
So in love with bein seen,
Probably it's time to intervene,
But she doesn't care, so she keep the party goin in the meantime,
Till us all over she can't rewind,
If she gets her fix well then she's fine,
I should prolly hit her with the peace sign,
Says she wants me and I fall for it each time,
She's aware she's a bad chick,
Studyin at FIDM, cutting fabric,
I really think her souls made of plastic,
End of the story is inevitably tragic,
Uh, yeah,

Why don't we go somewhere, somewhere, somewhere
Why don't we go somewhere, somewhere, somewhere

Would you like to go to paradise
Cause I'm not tryna go alone
Run away with me to paradise
If you wanna leave, then we can go
Cause the real world told me lies
The realest lies ever told
So let's run away and find paradise, paradise
And soon paradise will be home

If you wanna leave
If you wanna go
Baby don't leave yeah

Take my hand, shut your eyes and imagine
Wouldn't it be nice
Just to have an escape, a distraction
Far away from this life

I tried to be cool but this world's too cruel for me
to sit around and simply drown in fear
So I'm asking you, what would you do
If we could get out of here?

Would you like to go to paradise
Cause I'm not tryna go alone

Your love's like a fantasy
Nothing like what I saw on the news yesterday
Another man down, blood on the ground
Makes me wanna just run away
Where we run is a mystery
Ignorance is a bliss to me
Cause whenever I turn on my TV it's just misery

I tried to be cool but this world's too cruel for me
to sit around and simply drown in fear
So I'm asking you, what would you do
If we could get out of here, because I want to go

Would you like to go to paradise
Cause I'm not tryna go alone
Run away with me to paradise
If you wanna leave, then we can go
Cause the real world told me lies
The realest lies ever told
So let's run away and find paradise, paradise
And soon paradise will be home

Home
Home
Home
Paradise is in my mind baby
Paradise is in my mind baby
It won't take too long to find baby
Paradise is in my mind baby
In paradise we're free
To do what we want to do
We're free baby

You can't run away forever
---------------------------------------------------
Will you end my pain?
Will you take my life?
Will you bleed me out?
Will you hang me out to dry?
Will you take my soul in the midnight rain?
While I'm falling apart
While I'm going

Will you end my pain?
Will you take my life?
Will you bleed me out?
Will you hang me out to dry?
Will you take my soul in the midnight rain?
While I'm falling apart
While I'm going
Insane

(Most people are searching for happiness
They're looking for it
They're trying to find it in someone
Or something outside of themselves
That's a fundamental mistake
Happiness is something that you are
And it comes from the way you speak)

Can you break my bones?
Will you tear my skin?
Can you taste my lust?
Can you feel my sin?

See I'm a waste of life
I should just kill myself
Yeah, I could slit my wrists
But it really wouldn't help
Wouldn't fix my issues
Or change your mind
Cause I broke your heart
And you buried mine
Now I'm 6 feet deep and I can't breathe
I got dirt in my eyes
And blood on my sleeves
But I dig my way up
Through these roots and leaves
So I can get some air
So I can finally breathe
And now I'm on my knees
Oh baby begging please
Will you
Will you

Will you end my pain?
Will you take my life?
Will you bleed me out?
Will you hang me out to dry?
Will you take my soul in the midnight rain?
While I'm falling apart
While I'm going

Will you end my pain?
Will you take my life?
Will you bleed me out?
Will you hang me out to dry?
Will you take my soul in the midnight rain?
While I'm falling apart
While I'm going
Insane

(We cannot choose the things that will happen to us but we can choose the attitude we will take towards anything that happens to us)

Goodbye
Don't you miss me when I'm gone
Goodbye
Cause you're the fucking reason that I'm not around
Goodbye
Don't you miss me when I'm, miss me when I'm gone
Goodbye
Cause you're the fucking reason that I'm not around
Fucking reason that I'm not around
Bitch, you're the fucking reason that I'm not around
---------------------------------------------------
There's still a light on your table
There's still your name on my phone
I can't believe I'm not able
To call

We met in a beautiful place
You danced, I talked
I go back there every single day
I'm still there but you're not

You lit me up and led me inside
Then you disappeared with no warning sign
You broke more than my heart
When you left without saying goodbye
I'm here to let you know
I'm here to let you go

There's still your voice in my memory
There's still a way that you move
I can't believe that's the way out
You choose

We live in a beautiful world
We danced, we talked
I found a girl and she stayed with me
She's here and you're not

You lit me up and you led me inside
Then you disappeared with no warning sign
You broke more than my heart
When you left without saying goodbye
I'm here to let you know
I'm here to let you go

We live, we breathe
We hope, we bleed
We love, we lose
We die

We live, we breathe
We hope, we bleed
We love, we lose
We die

We live, we breathe
We hope, we bleed
We love, we lose
We die

We live, we breathe
We hope, we bleed
We love, we lose
We die

You lit me up and you led me inside
Then you disappeared with no warning sign
You broke more than my heart
When you left without saying goodbye
I'm here to let you know
I'm here to let you go
---------------------------------------------------
Oh,
Once upon a midnight dreary
I woke with something in my head
I couldn't escape the memory
Of a phone call and of what you said

Like a game show contestant with a parting gift
I could not believe my eyes
When I saw through the voice of a trusted friend
Who needs to humor me and tell me lies
Yeah, humor me and tell me lies

And I'll lie too and say I don't mind
And as we seek so shall we find
And when you're feeling open I'll still be here
But not without a certain degree of fear
Of what will be with you and me
I still can see things hopefully

But you
Why you wanna give me a run-around
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down

And shake me and my confidence
About a great many things
But I've been there I can see it cower
Like a nervous magician waiting in the wings

Of a bad play where the heroes are right
And nobody thinks or expects too much
And Hollywood's calling for the movie rights
Singing hey babe let's keep in touch
Hey baby let's keep in touch

But I want more than a touch I want you to reach me
And show me all the things no one else can see
So what you feel becomes mine as well
And soon if we're lucky we'd be unable to tell
What's yours and mine, the fishing's fine
And it doesn't have to rhyme, so don't you feed me a line

But you
Why you wanna give me a run-around
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down

Tra la la la la bombardier this is the pilot speaking
And I've got some news for you
It seems my ship still stands no matter what you drop
And there ain't a whole lot that you can do

Oh sure the banner may be torn and the wind's gotten colder
Perhaps I've grown a little cynical
But I know no matter what the waitress brings
I shall drink it and always be full
Yeah, I will drink it and always be full

Oh I like coffee, and I like tea
I'd like to be able to enter a final plea
I still got this dream that you just can't shake
I love you to the point you can no longer take

Well all right okay
So be that way, I hope and pray
That there's something left to say...

For you, now
Why you wanna give me a run-around
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down

Oh, yeah, now
Why you wanna give me a run-around
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down
---------------------------------------------------
I heard that you were doing yoga
With Uma Thurman's mother
Just outside of Woodstock
Now you're watering all the flowers
You planted with your new girlfriend
Outside on the rooftop

Just another phase you're rushing on through
Go all New Age, outrunning your blues

Fifty gleaming chances in a row
Then I watch you flick them down like dominoes
Must feel good being Mr. Start-Again

I know
Know a girl who knows a
Another girl who knows the woman that you hurt
It's strange to see you smoking marijuana
You used to do the most cocaine
Of anyone I'd ever met

Just another phase you're shooting on through
The whole world changes right around you
You get fifty gleaming chances in a row
And I watch you flick them down like dominoes
Must feel good being Mr. Start-Again
Yeah, it must feel good being Mr. Start-Again
Don't get up
Yeah, it must feel good being Mr. Start-Again
---------------------------------------------------
Everyone knows that you're too good for me, don't they?
I'm a cheater, I lie, and I'm shy
But you like to say hello to total strangers
Shivering pines and walls of colour
I can't believe I used to stay inside

But every perfect summer's gotta say goodnight
Now I watch you run through the amber light
I used to love the party, now I'm not alright
Drinking in the dark, take me home tonight

Baby, you're a big star
You're a big star
Wanna take your picture

I toss up if it's worth it now every time I get on a plane
I've got so much to tell you and not enough time to do it in

But every perfect summer's gotta take its flight
I'll still watch you run through the winter light
I used to love the party, now I'm not alright
Hope the honeybees make it home tonight

Baby, you're a big star
You're a big star
Wanna take your picture

'Til I die
'Til I die
'Til I die
---------------------------------------------------
Wearing SPF 3000 for the ultraviolet rays
Made it to the island on the last of the outbound planes (Ah-ah)
Got a trunk full of Simone and Celine, and of course, my magazines
I'm gonna live out my days

Won't somebody, anybody, be the leader of a new regime?
Free the keepers of the burnt-out scene another day
Lust and paranoia reign supreme
We need the leader of a new regime
---------------------------------------------------
Vengas cuando vengas
Deja atras el peso
Quema las maletas
Tira tu champu

Tengas lo que tengas
Dame lo que quieras
A plazos o entera
Como veas tu

Hagas lo que hagas
Hazlo porque quieres
No pongo deberes
Y no paso lista

Vistas como vistas
Falda o pantalon
No te me disfraces
Para la ocasion

No te quiero retener
Si te da el punto, te vas
Y aunque me veas mirar
Baila como tu quieras bailar

Vengas cuando vengas
Ven sin salvavidas
Sin paracaidas
Y sin afeitar

Digas lo que digas
Dilo sin sedante
Fuerte y al semblante
Lo puedo encajar

Hagas lo que hagas
Que sea sincero
Sin "quizas", sin "peros"
Y sin abalista

Vistas como vistas
Seda o algodon
No te me disfraces
Para la ocasion

No te quiero retener
Si te da el punto, te vas
Y aunque me veas mirar
Baila como tu quieras bailar

Rari-ra (Rarira)
Ah-ah (Ay-ah)
Ah-ah (Ah-ah-ah-ah)

Baila como quieras bailar
Baila como quieras bailar
Baila como quieras bailar
Baila como tu quieras bailar

Baila como quieras bailar
Baila como quieras bailar
Baila como quieras bailar
Baila como tu quieras bailar

Baila como quieras bailar (Baila, baila)
Baila como quieras bailar (Como baila, baila)
Baila como quieras bailar (Baila, baila)
Baila como tu quieras bailar

Baila como quieras bailar (Baila, baila)
Baila como quieras bailar (Baila)
Baila como quieras bailar
Baila como tu quieras bailar
---------------------------------------------------
I've walked among the shadows
You wiped my tears away
And I've felt the pain of heartbreak
And I've seen the brighter days

And I've prayed prayers to Heaven
From my lowest place
And I have held Your blessings
God, You give and take away

No matter what I have, Your grace is enough
No matter where I am, I'm standing in Your love

On the mountains, I will bow my life
To the One who set me there
In the valley, I will lift my eyes
To the One who sees me there

When I'm standing on the mountain
I didn't get there on my own
When I'm walking through the valley
I know I am not alone!

You're God of the hi-hi-hills and valleys
Hi-hi-hills and valleys
God of the hi-hi-hills and valleys
And I am not alone

I've watched my dreams get broken
In You, I hope again
No matter what I know
I'm safe inside Your hands

On the mountains, I will bow my life
To the One who set me there (to the One who set me there)
In the valley, I will lift my eyes
To the One who sees me there

When I'm standing on the mountain
I didn't get there on my own
When I'm walking through the valley
I know I am not alone

You're God of the hi-hi-hills and valleys
Hi-hi-hills and valleys
God of the hills and valleys
And I am not alone

Father, You give and take away
Every joy and every pain
Through it all, You will remain
Over it all

Father, You give and take away
Every joy and every pain
Through it all, You will remain
Over it all

On the mountains, I will bow my life, yeah
In the valley, I will lift my eyes, yeah!

On the mountains, I will bow my life
To the One who set me there (to the One who set me there)
In the valley, I will lift my eyes
To the One who sees me there

When I'm standing on the mountain
I didn't get there on my own
When I'm walking through the valley
I know I am not alone

You're God of the hi-hi-hills and valleys (yeah)
Hi-hi-hills and valleys
God of the hi-hi-hills and valleys (You're the God of the hills)
And I am not alone

You're God of the hi-hi-hills and valleys (yeah!)
Hi-hi-hills and valleys
God of the hi-hi-hills and valleys (You're the God of the hills)
And I am not alone (God of the valleys)

And I will choose to say
Blessed be Your Name
And I am not alone
---------------------------------------------------
If I had to break it down, I'd say it's the way you love to dance
Moving the furniture when my back is turned
The flick of the lights and the world falls away
And your office job, and your silver hair
But our shapes in the dark are the reason I've stayed for all these years

I thought I was a genius
But now I'm twenty-two
And it's starting to feel like all I know how to do is
Put on a suit and take it away
With my fistful of tunes that it's painful to play
Fingernail worlds, like favourite seashells
They fill up my nights and then they float away

I've got hundreds of gowns, I've got paintings in frames
And a throat that fills with panic every festival day
Dutifully falling apart for the Princess of Norway

But you with your doll's lashes, your infinite T-shirts
I should've known when your favourite record was the same as my father's you'd take me down

I guess I'll always be this way
Swallowed up by the words and halfway to space
But there by the fire, you offered your hand
And as I took it, I loved you, the boy with the plan

You felled me clean as a pine
The man with the axe
And the look in his eyes

We've been through so many hard times, I'm writing a love song
For you, baby
---------------------------------------------------
And the lie was not enough
Tell the truth and you're not tough
Time just stopped and I must wait
Enter into the debate
And the lie was not enough
Tell the truth and you're not tough

Is it just the scene you've been stealing?
Or is it the heart that needs healing?

What equals love?
'Cause I forgot the equation
Well I don't know, but I think it's trust
Plus, don't forget the devotion

I would call you to account
For the duties that you flount
Lock up the glass house every day
Hope the problem goes away
And the lie was not enough
Tell the truth and you're not tough

Is it just the scene you've been stealing?
Or is it your heart that needs healing?

What equals love?
'Cause I forgot the equation
Well I don't know, but I think it's trust
Plus, don't forget the devotion

What equals love?
'Cause I forgot the equation
Well I don't know, but I think it's trust
And don't forget the devotion

I really wanna work it out, work it out
I really wanna work it out, work it out

(I really wanna work it out)
What equals love?
('Cause it feels like we're falling apart)
'Cause I forgot the equation
(I really wanna work it out)
Well I don't know, but I think it's trust
(Feels like we're falling apart)
And don't forget the devotion
(I really wanna work it out)
What equals love?
('Cause it feels like we're falling apart)
'Cause I forgot the equation
(I really wanna work it out)
Well I don't know, but I think it's trust
(Feels like we're falling apart)
I feel like I'm falling
---------------------------------------------------
Here's to me
I'm on the edge of my seat
Bound to fall
But I'm hoping you fall into me

Here's to us
Here's to the ties that I've cut
Along the way
Here's to the eyes that I've shut

Here's to my soul
Here's to the weight of my gold
Here's to the words that I've sold
Here's to the cold deep in my bones

Here's to my door
Here's to records that no one would pay for
Songs that I wrote and got laid for
Here's to the floor
Here's to the floor

Here's to my rent
Here's to the money I've spent on
Trying to do what I'm bent on
Trying to breathe...
---------------------------------------------------
Born in the year of OxyContin
Raised in the tall grass
Teen millionaire having nightmares from the camera flash
Now I'm alone on a windswept island
Caught in the complex divorce of the seasons
Won't take the call if it's the label or the radio
Ahh
Ahh

Arm in a cast at the museum gala
Fork in my purse to take home to my mother
Supermodels all dancing 'round a pharaoh's tomb

Now if you're looking for a savior, well that's not me
You need someone to take your pain for you?
Well, that's not me
'Cause we're all broken and sad
Where are the dreams that we had?
Can't find the dreams that we had
Ah, ah, ah
Let's hope the sun will show us the path
Let's hope the sun will show us the path
Ah, ah, ah
I just hope the sun will show us the path
Savior is not me
I just hope the sun will show us the path
Savior is not me
I just hope the sun will show us the path
Path, path
---------------------------------------------------
Irene, questa sera la faccia te la strapperei via
Cosi faresti paura al mondo ma resteresti sempre mia
In questa notte di buio pesto, che forse era buio pomodoro
Le mie mani Brigate Rosse accarezzano te che sei Aldo Moro
E l'hai letto nelle stelle che la musica ci dara il pane
Il realismo l'avrai lasciato a qualche mercatino equosolidale
Irene, non ci credere poi tanto allo zodiaco
Che la musica il pane quotidiano lo da solo a chi e celiaco

Il futuro che ti potevo dare l'ho
Barattato per i vinili che ho in soffitta
Te li regalero quando avrai perso le speranze
E ti sentirai sconfitta
Il futuro che ti potevo dare
Alla fine e una fregatura meglio
Che ti sposi un ingegnere
Un notaio od un dentista
Oppure, oppure, oppure il tuo analista

Una luce indagatrice, color della cedrata
Brucia forte in questa stanza e incenerisce la serata
E mentre dormi un rivolo di saliva ti scocca dalla bocca
Preciso come un bacio mai dato o un orologio che rintocca
Irene, i cantautori dicono che l'importante
Non e quante volte cadi, ma se hai il coraggio di rialzarti
Ma dopo mille cadute roventi
Non ci resta che imparare a vivere come i serpenti

E il futuro che ti potevo dare l'ho
Barattato per i vinili che ho in soffitta
Te li regalero quando avrai perso le speranze
E vorrai star solo zitta
Il futuro che ti potevo dare
Alla fine e una fregatura, senti
Corri via da tutto questo
Scappa forte, finche puoi
Ricordami come Neville Paciock
In un mondo di Draco Malfoy

Irene non fidarti mai
Dei testi delle mie canzoni
Soprattutto di quelle da parafrasare
Che sono le peggiori
Fidati del pane fresco
Nelle mattine d'inverno
E del paradiso solo se
Solo se visto dall'inferno

Il futuro che ti potevo dare l'ho
Barattato per i vinili che ho in soffitta
Te li regalero quando avrai perso le speranze
E ti sentirai sconfitta

I've been reading books of old
The legends and the myths
Achilles and his gold
Hercules and his gifts
Spiderman's control
And Batman with his fists
And clearly I don't see myself upon that list

But she said, where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can kiss

I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo

Oh, I want something just like this
I want something just like this

I've been reading books of old
The legends and the myths
The testaments they told
The moon and its eclipse
And Superman unrolls
A suit before he lifts
But I'm not the kind of person that it fits

She said, where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can miss

I want something just like this
I want something just like this


Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo


She said, where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can kiss


I want something just like this

Halbes Jahr nach JBG 3
Kommen Rapper aus den Lochern und fragen, "Ist es endlich vorbei?"
Jein, aber damit ihr auch mal wieder 'n bisschen gute Laune kriegt
Hier jetzt 'n Sommerhit fur euch

Ich hang' ab im Gold's Gym
Bitch, ich hab' die Chrome-Rims
Fahr' den Lambo Farbe Mango
Meine Gang geht all-in

Ich komm' fresh im Deus-Maximus-Shirt
Lebensmotto: Mehr Curls, mehr Girls
Der Rest ist Jacke wie Hose (yeah)
Oder wie MOK sagt: Flasche wie Dose (aha)
Ich hab' in Kapstadt paar Slums angeguckt (what the fuck?)
Und mich fast am Champagner verschluckt
Alpha-Banger ist die Family (ey, yeah, ey, yeah)
Mittelfinger fur die Enemys
Und wahrend sich grad wieder ma' 'ne Gang bekriegt
Chill' ich mit Kylie in Venice Beach
Mein Handy beept, Drive-by in Compton
Ich sag', "Rest in Peace" und geh' Tennis spiel'n (c'est la vie)
Und Kim K. sagt
"Hol den Jet-Ski, ich will auf diese Insel da!"
Doch der Booty von Kim ist ein Pfirsich
So verliert sie die Balance wie ein Kind auf der Kirmes

Ich hang' ab im Gold's Gym
Bitch, ich hab' die Chrome-Rims
Fahr' den Lambo Farbe Mango
Meine Gang geht all-in (ballin')

Zu breit fur den Jet-Ski in Venice Beach (2Pac-Style)
Kipp' Hennessy auf meine Enemys (Enemys kill'n)
Ich chill' mit Kylie und Kim K. in Beverly (Beverly Hills)
Ich bin nicht John F., doch ich kenne die


Bitches im Venice nennen uns Papi Chulos
Sie wissen genau, wir sind zwei Stars in Europe
Die ganze Nacht uber WhatsApp am texten
Ich frage sie, "You wanna see my Poststamp-Collection?"
Mit Gun am Strand, dann kommt die Polizei
Sie lassen uns laufen, sind nicht engstirnig wie Robert Geiss
Dicker Oberarmumfang, wir spielen Volleyball am Strand
Und hoffentlich will die Fotze Dick und blowt deshalb den Schwanz


Ich hang' ab im Gold's Gym
Bitch, ich hab' die Chrome-Rims

Zu breit fur den Jet-Ski
Zu breit fur den Jet (Absturz)
Zu breit fur den Benz, zu breit fur die Fans
Junge, mach ma' Panorama-Modus (komm)
Zu breit fur den Flatscreen
Das ganze Bild verdeckt (Absturz)
Zu breit fur den Pelz, zu breit fur die Welt
Ich umspanne mit dem Lat den Globus

Ich hang' ab im Gold's Gym
Bitch, ich hab' die Chrome-Rims
Fahr' den Lambo Farbe Mango
Meine Gang geht all-in (ballin')

Zu breit fur den Jet-Ski in Venice Beach (2Pac-Style)

La la la la la la, du Huso-Kelb rollst Blunts
Ich hab' Gelbgold an und einen Elf-Zoll-Schwanz (yallah)

Choya, ich habe das Rapgame gefickt (Kanye)
Und dabei noch einen Legday geskippt
Canim, fette Backen, die Kahbas top
In der Westentasche der Flachmann MOK
Ich schluck' mir eine Viagra (schluck)
Wie Robert Geiss seit den Siebzigern
Denn ich bin ein Nafri-Superstar


Heut gibt's fur jede meiner Sidechicks
Zwei, drei Gucci-Jeans
Ich trainier' die Beine nicht
Weil man sie im Club nicht sieht
Heut gibt's fur jede meiner Sidechicks
Ein Bag von Louis V
Ich trainier' die Beine nicht
Weil man sie im Club nicht sieht

Insta-Fotzen, Facebook-Rambos
No-Filter-Bitches, Diskopumper
Snapchat-Models, Beauty-Blogger
Spielerfrauen mit blauen Haken
Gangsterrapper, Fashion-Heroes
Echo-Sieger, der Sohn von Kanye
Influencer, Party-People
Sie trainier'n die Beine nicht


Legday-Skipper, Rapgame-Ficker
JBG-Tour, wir seh'n uns Backstage, chica (yeah, yeah)
Ich bin fresh, fresh, fresh
24/7 immer Stress, Stress, Stress
Ey, mein Telefon lauft heiﬂ wegen Internet-Rambos
Mutter fragen, wann das Kindergeld ankommt (ahh)
Fick auf den Alltag
Wir sind im Club, tanzen Salsa oder Walzer
Und die Skinny-Beine machen's grade so mit (mit)
Doch die Arme sind dick und deine Nase, sie bricht (crash)
Bei mir bedeutet Legday
Dass mir deine Shawty einen leckt, ey

Tremenda asesina
Se peina y se guilla
Se viste y se maquilla
Traquila, chiquilla
O te siento en mi silla
Hoy tu vas a ser mia
El Don te desafia
Segura en mi via
Cuidao si te tira
Y si tu novio se activa
Yo activo la guerrilla
Y si el Boster te lo pilla
No le va a dar ni cosquilla

Entonces tirate bien suelta, como gabete

Yo soy su gato
Ella es mi gata en celo
Quiere buscar rebuleo del bueno
Quiere fingir que no le gusta el blin-blineo
Y cuando canto hasta abajo con mi perreo
Por ahi anda su novio en un fantasmeo
Me esta, que esta noche va haber un tiroteo
Dile que yo ando con mis gatos en el patrulleo

No one is wrong or right
I want to end our fight
Let's dance our way into the light
We never saw inside
Love is not what has failed
Why can't we both be saved?

For the older games we played
We have already paid

Stranger lover
This day will be our last
Stranger lover
If you're swallowed by the past
Stranger lover
This day will be our last
Stranger lover
Come heal in my arms

Today is a new day
We'll throw our regrets away

For the older games we played
We have already paid

Stranger lover
This day will be our last
Stranger lover
If you're swallowed by the past
Stranger lover
This day will be our last
Stranger lover
Come heal in my arms

This day, this day...

Stranger lover
This day will be our last
Stranger lover
If you're swallowed by the past
Stranger lover
This day will be our last
Stranger lover
Come heal in my arms

There's a story of a young man
Who was taken from his home.
He missed his sister become a woman
And his father growing old.
From the distance he watched his mother,
Mourn a loss, all alone.
And when he thinks about his brother,
He can't seem to find the phone.

From the window of his life, he can see his home.
As he passes by he feels a pain no one knows.
Past every better judgement, he packs his things to run away.
Like an ocean distances a beast that can't be tamed...

Woah, woah, woah
He left you behind!
Woah, woah, woah
He left you behind!

Now the young man roams the globe
Searching for the very thing he left at home.
He searched far and wide, under every stone,
The more he walked the more he was alone.
This young man is a lot like me,
Except he learned from those mistakes he made.
If I don't slow down I might break
I'll be trapped forever in this cage

From the window of my life I can see home.
As it passes by I feel a pain no one knows.
Past every better judgement I pack my things to run away.
Like an ocean distances a beast that can't be tamed...

Woah, woah, woah
He left you behind!
Woah, woah, woah
He left you behind!

It's the blackout, 'Rari got the back out
Showing my black ass, engine in the glass house
Started in the crack house, Obama went the back route
Kill bin Laden, 'nother four up in the black house
Still got the Macs out, pull the mask down like a mascot
Still trick with bitches, out with money or with ass shots
GOOD had room for one more, I took the last spot
Re-Up Gang, P the nigga, 'Ye done hit the jackpot
Whole 'nother level, then you add fame
That's a whole 'nother devil, legit drug dealer
That's a whole 'nother bezel, the carbon Audemar
That's a whole 'nother metal, but still keep it ghetto
Behind the scenes, pull strings like Gepetto
The gun blow steam, whistle like a tea kettle
Runnin' like the rebels, UNLV
Sport shoe on a pedal, I let you niggas settle (Yeah)

Trouble on my mind
I got trouble on my mind
Trouble on my mind
So much trouble on my mind
Trouble on my mind
I got trouble on my mind
Trouble on my mind
So much trouble on my mind


Pharrell said "get 'em", so I got 'em
Tripped on Bristol Palin then I accidentally shot 'em
Then it ricocheted and killed the game, I'm a problem
'Cause I wanna fuck the world but not a fan of using condoms
Pardon my French, I'm going hard as my dick
When I envision my tip on the crust of bitch lips
Mr. Lipschitz has been trippin'
Since I mentioned Reptar triceratops dinosaur dick
I feel it in my gut to kill these muthafucks
Is a must, like the arm of my pits
You niggas coming shorter than a Bushwick Billy costume
On sale during Christmas in Philly
Um, well, not really, it's getting kinda chilly
Let's hit a couple bars and give some bitches wet willies
Soaked, getting jiggy with it in Bel-Air's richest
With a bag of pills, couple berries and a biscuit


Trouble on my mind
I got trouble on my mind
Trouble on my mind
So much trouble on my mind


I'm a fucking walking paradox
And a really shitty rapper in my favorite pair of socks
Ironed pair of dockers, two Glocks cocked screamin', "West side!"
With the speakers blastin' a pair of Pacs
Yonkers 10 milli, you're silly
Thinkin' that this 'preme wasn't free, willy
The feeling is neutral, the gang is youthful
And fuckin' tighter than Chad Hugo's pupils, it's Wolf Gang and the


With the Re-Up's a helluva buzz
Rick James said cocaine's a helluva drug
Who else could put the hipsters with felons and thugs
And paint a perfect picture of what sellin' it does?
This is for the critics, who doubted the chemistry
Two different worlds, same symmetry
And this black art, see the wizardry when you at the top
Of your game, you make enemies, you'll never finish me

Trouble on my mind
I got trouble on my mind
Trouble on my mind
So much trouble on my mind

I ain't lookin' for a ring 'cause I got what I want

You know what I'm like if I don't get to eat in the morning
You know I go wild if I don't get to eat in the morning

I ain't lookin' for a ring 'cause I got what I need

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

You could make me a believer
Even if that shit ain't true
You could make me commit murder
Baby, I'd kill for you

In my eyes
Even if you are wrong, you are right
Even if it's a terrible crime, it's alright
'Cause I got your back, and I know you got mine
I belong to the church of your name, sing a song
'Cause I worship the ground you walk on
If I pray for you, I know you'll be there

You could make me a believer
Even if that shit ain't true
You could make me commit murder
Baby, I'd kill for you

In my bed I believe every word that you've said
Just a kiss and you make me forget
All the bad, the battles we lost, the bodies we hid
You don't know, just how far I'd be willing to go
You put the cracks into my moral code
So you can count on me to always be there

You could make me a believer
Even if that shit ain't true
You could make me commit murder
Baby, I'd kill for you

Oh, Lord, forgive my weary hands
And for what they may do
I'll carry out his evil plans
If he wants me to


In your dream, you're drownin', I just waltzed in and saved you
I'm your alternate escape route, the altar you pray to
Your ultimate savior, your behavior is altered
Ain't your fault 'cause I made you
Brainwash and persuade you
Gibraltar, your faith'll never falter or waver
One you call to in danger, I'm your guardian angel
Nobody can tell you shit, you've already made your
Mind just follow me, babe, you
Won't be sorry you stayed, you
Always ride, whatever the plan is
'Til the end, even if I led us into an ambush
Even if we robbed a First National and cops caught us red-handed
They're coming at us, and we're trapped with our backs up
Against the wall, and it's too tall
You'd catapult me or hold the ladder for me
Stay back to get captured, take the fall
You make it all worth it
Baby doll, you're perfect the way you are
Accidents happen
All I know is you love me, that's really all that matters
And any who cross our paths are just collateral damage
At your side, got your lateral, back, your front, diagonal
Backwards, blackbirds, we attack like animals
When they threaten what we have it's a natural reaction
You'll lay a bitch flat on her back in a second flat for me
Who tries to take your man from you
It's blasphemy, another casualty, you'll go whatever route
Do whatever you have to do, you'd blast for me
I never doubt that
That's 'cause you


You could make me a believer
Even if that shit ain't true
You could make me commit murder
Baby, I'd kill for you
---------------------------------------------------
Vivre au present
Desirer vraiment
Et n'anticiper que le lendemain
Et les instants
Eblouissants
Qu'on aura chipes au destin
C'est ca que tu m'as appris

Marcher entre le sol et le ciel
Sais-tu ce que tu m'as appris

A nager dans le noir
A remercier la pluie
A rester tard le soir
C'est ca que tu m'as appris

A raconter l'histoire
Relatant qui je suis
En acceptant d'y croire
C'est ca que tu m'as appris

C'est ca que tu m'as appris

J'ai longtemps
Cru que lentement
J'allais m'approcher de la fin
(Oh) sans virage, sans grand tournant
Que je connaissais mon destin
C'est ca que tu m'as appris

Marcher entre le sol et le ciel
Sais tu ce que tu m'as appris

A desamorcer l'ame
Quand la colere grandit
La mise a mort du drame
C'est ca que tu m'as appris

A raconter l'histoire
Relatant qui je suis
En acceptant d'y croire
C'est ca que tu m'as appris
C'est ca que tu m'as appris
C'est ca que tu m'as appris

A desamorcer l'ame
Quand la colere grandit
La mise a mort du drame
C'est ca que tu m'as appris

A raconter l'histoire
Relatant qui je suis
En acceptant d'y croire
C'est ca que tu m'as appris
C'est ca que tu m'as appris
C'est ca que tu m'as appris

Back to the hold
Back to the old
Back to the ghost in the steady

Got these suns in my Chevy
Feelin' heavy
This led pipes, they don't tread lightly

Sittin' silently
Living with my son
Let me knick capacity
No more catastrophy
Or catastrophic epiphany
Epic stories of my history
Disproportion it display to intoxicate my luminaries
But with all of that
Dysfunction got the best of me
Disseminate the world's springs, with no apologies

Ohhhhh

I'm giving... no, I'm giving in
All I got is what's right in front of me
What's right in front of me
Is the people that I see
And the places that I've been

I've been blessed but I've been taught stuff round as sea
And the love that got buried deep down beneath
Seen in a vision on a BQE
With the test to see
Restlessness, it got the best of me

When the curtain dropped down
When lights went on
When the music stopped
Ain't got no soul
When the words ran out and my voice is sod
Hey there, superstar, not feeling so high

Trying to be a superman, with superfans
Doing there handstand, while writing your name in the sand
Heard you got a master plan, made of plaster from the master's hand
After Matthew, when his cast of carrages past through your land
After the blast, just past, to zaz to zaft
After Matt, then he craft his arm

I'm giving... no, I'm giving in
All I got is what's right in front of me
What's right in front of me
Is the people that I see
And the places that I've been

I've been blessed but I've been taught stuff round as sea
And the love that got buried deep down beneath
Seen in a vision on a BQE
With the test to see
Restlessness, it got the best of me

I'm giving... no, I'm giving in
All I got is what's right in front of me
What's right in front of me
Is the people that I see
And the places that I've been

I've been blessed but I've been taught stuff round as sea
And the love that got buried deep down beneath
Seen in a vision on a BQE
With the test to see
Restlessness, it got the best of me

My girl don't want me cause of my dirty laundry,
And I think that she knows,
I'm out of control,
With all of this money they all want something from me,
It's starting to show,
I'm out of control

Man I can't see shit in the spotlight,
She found receipts from the last night,
In the back of my jeans keep it real right,

Work long all day till the night time,
She wants to know what's the deal like,
I think that she knows can't keep sealed tight,
Doin all these things that you want like,
Girls with cocaine on they backsides,
I know, my girl don't want me cause of my dirty laundry, let's go

My girl don't want me cause of my dirty laundry,

My girl don't want me cause of my dirty laundry,
And I think that she knows,
I'm out of control,
With all of this money they all want something from me,

Davam trojky jako Kobe

Pred rokem jsem nemel co do huby
Ted si ziju sen
Na prvnim miste laska a na druhym svoboda
Na tretim cest, potom pokora a zase dokola
Chudym davat, bohatym brat

J'vois nos etreintes gravees sur le drapeau noir de la mort
Nos torts, se tordent, le temps n'efface mes remords

Debout sous l'un de ces ebats solaires
J'me sens deboussole
J'ai passe des nuits a chercher qui j'etais
Un homme le devient quand on lui dit "Je t'aime"
Dans l'escalier, je vois les etoiles qui restent alignees
Malgre l'echec de nos destins lies, le reste m'a piege
La nuit, j'danse avec les ombres, fascine par le mepris des hommes
Nos ames se perdent parfois dans des zones
Dans lesquelles resonne le desordre
Les mains ternies par le temps, je t'aimais tant que
Je passe mes nuits a t'ecrire des estampes
Seul dans la tempete, mains sur les tempes
Le froid me tempere, mon ame est en paix

J'vois nos etreintes gravees sur le drapeau noir de la mort
Nos torts se tordent, le temps n'efface mes remords

Non, j'en veux pas a ceux qui trahissent, j'sais qu'ils souffrent d'eux-memes
Non, j'en veux pas a ceux qui m'haissent, j'sais qu'ils souffrent d'eux-memes

Conscience alterait pas l'alter ego
Pendant qu'mon cúur se retablira
Demain des l'aube, je t'oublierai
Comme a su le faire Victor Hugo
J'me demande pourquoi t'en pleures, pourquoi t'en pleures ?
J'ai patiente mais c'est mon heure
Je t'ecris des fables emouvantes
On s'enlise dans les sables mouvants
Cette rancúur venait de nous-meme
Notre histoire est sans denouement

J'vois nos etreintes gravees sur le drapeau noir de la mort
Nos torts se tordent, le temps n'efface mes remords

Non, j'en veux pas a ceux qui trahissent, j'sais qu'ils souffrent d'eux-memes
Non, j'en veux pas a ceux qui m'haissent, j'sais qu'ils souffrent d'eux-memes
Non, j'en veux pas a ceux qui trahissent, j'sais qu'ils souffrent d'eux-memes
Non, j'en veux pas a ceux qui m'haissent, j'sais qu'ils souffrent d'eux-memes

J'vois nos etreintes gravees sur le drapeau noir de la mort
Nos torts, se tordent, le temps n'efface mes remords

I only wanted to have fun
Learning to fly learning to run
I let my heart decide the way
When I was young
Deep down I must have always known
That this would be inevitable
To earn my stripes I'd have to pay
And bare my soul

I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who can't stand the reflection that they see
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago

When I walk around all of the streets
Where I grew up and found my feet
They can't look me in the eye
It's like they're scared of me
I try to think of things to say
Like a joke or a memory
But they don't recognise me now
In the light of day

I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who never became who they thought they'd be
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago
A million years ago
---------------------------------------------------
Have no fear
For when I'm alone
I'll be better off
Than I was before

I've got this light
I'll be around to grow
Who I was before
I cannot recall

Long nights allow
Me to feel I'm falling
I am falling

The lights go out
Let me feel I'm falling
I am falling
safely to the ground

I'll take this soul
That's inside me now
Like a brand new friend
I'll forever know

I've got this life
And the will to show
I will always be
Better than before

Long nights allow
Me to feel I'm falling
I am falling

The lights go out
Let me feel I'm falling
I am falling
safely to the ground
---------------------------------------------------
Never forget her
Never forget her



Don't look at me now
You bring me to the room
You take me upside down
You tell me what I told you to do

Si ella quiere verme, va a buscarme al club
A las siete y media estoy gozando a full
Trajo dos champan y un pack 'e Red Bull
Como no va a encantarme si me lo hace ufff

Nena, uf, Scxlvry grooves
Santo mandale mas fire al kush (Fuego)
Voy a tumbarsela como Bush (Okey, yeh)
Yo se que esa mami esta esperando el tour (-rando el tour)
Duro duro, suite like Tony Tur (Tony Tur)
Me baje otro Honey, Ysy A Shakur (Okey, yeh)
I'm a thugger, give me one cartoon
Ya vi to' violeta, ahora veo to' con zoom
Bang bang, cookin' better flows
'Toy puesto pa' lo que quieren to'
Con lo' inesperado' que esperan to' (Eh)
Falta alcohol, me estoy desesperando (Cero)
Trajiste una pero eran do' (Ysy)
Voy a ponerme en modo Bellator (Claro)
Nunca delator, snitch o fake cantor (No, no)
No fales de tener lo que Ysy te saco

Ma', los mios hablan con los hechos (Hechos)
Mi nombre rebota entre tus pechos (Pechos)
La bebota ama mi joyero (Oh, yeh)
Quiere que me deje como Quavo (Quavo)
Si ella quiere verme, va a buscarme al club (Ysy A)
A las siete y media estoy gozando a full (#ModoDiablo, bebe)
Trajo 2 champan y un pack 'e Red Bull (I got it)
Como no encantarme si me lo hace ufff

Mmm, eh (Bebe)

Too many cuts and too many broken bones
Draining the life, burying skeletons
Do or die, is this the feeling I'm craving?
Waiting for life to ignite
Is this the moment for taking?
A leap of faith, I'll

Jump into the fire, no fear
Taken to the edge but it still can't break me
I'm not caving in

The beat of a pulse, feeling it resonate
Into the night, hearing it fade away
Do or die, this is choice that I'm making
Feels like I'm living a lie
This is the moment for taking
A leap of faith I'll

Jump into the fire, no fear
Taken to the edge but it still can't break me
I'm not caving in
Nothing's gonna kill me, come take me
Closer to the edge but it still can't break me
I'm not caving in

So fill your lungs, inhale the future
Now scream it out
So fill your lungs, inhale the future
Now scream it out
Release the pressure!

So fill your lungs, inhale the future
Now scream it out
Release the pressure!
So fill your lungs, inhale the future
Now scream it out

Jump into the fire, no fear
Taken to the edge but it still can't break me
I'm not caving in
Nothing's gonna kill me, come take me
Closer to the edge but it still can't break me
I'm not caving in

(Jump into the fire)
(Jump into the fire)
I'm not caving in

Too many cuts and too many broken bones
---------------------------------------------------
Prepara, que agora e a hora
Do show das poderosas
Que descem e rebolam
Afrontam as fogosas
So as que incomodam
Expulsam as invejosas
Que ficam de cara quando toca
Prepara

Se nao ta mais a vontade, sai por onde entrei
Quando comeco a dancar, eu te enlouqueco, eu sei
Meu exercito e pesado, e a gente tem poder
Ameaca coisas do tipo: Voce!
Vai!

Solta o som, que e pra me ver dancando
Ate voce vai ficar babando
Para o baile pra me ver dancando
Chama atencao a toa
Perde a linha, fica louca

Prepara, que agora e a hora
Do show das poderosas
Que descem, rebolam
Afrontam as fogosas
So as que incomodam
Expulsam as invejosas
Que ficam de cara quando toca

Driving to Hawaii
Surfing down the street
Dreaming of these places
I may never see

Maybe if we get there
Things will be much easier
And life won't be nothing anymore
Well babe then we're together
We've always such nice weather
Guess we don't need these places anyway

We'll strum out and be picking our guitars
We'll drink all day and sing under the stars
How magically simple our life could be

Driving to Tahiti
Let's take off your bikini
Jump in something warmer
And fall asleep together

Maybe when it's all done
We can grow our hair long
Life won't be nothing anymore
Well babe when we're together
We've always such nice weather
Guess we don't need these places anyway

Driving to Hawaii
Surfing down the street
Driving to Hawaii
Surfing down the street
Driving to Hawaii
Surfing down the street
Driving to Hawaii
Surfing down the street

I took comfort in her sweetness
Her love yeah that was my weakness
When the fields sleep
When the wind dies
I remember you best
I fed off her flame contagious
They couldn't hold us down in cages
When the fields sleep
When the wind dies
I remember you best

I don't know when I'll see you babe
But I'm gonna keep my faith
Its been years since I felt your touch
But I'm never gonna give up
See you in the clouds again
Telling myself this ain't the end

Since you left my body went numb
Like I'm swimming in robitussin
In the purple
In the meadow
I remember you best
Maybe this world wasn't for us
Maybe we didn't give enough
In the purple
In the meadow
I remember you best

I don't know when I'll see you babe
But I'm gonna keep my faith
Its been years since I felt your touch
But I'm never gonna give up
Will meet again in northern lights
For now we have to say goodnight
---------------------------------------------------
Oooooh

Well
You and I both know that the house is haunted
And you and I both know that the ghost is me
You used to catch me in your bed sheets just rattlin your chains
Well back then baby, it didn't seem so strange


You used to bite, I used to moan

But now I'm mumbling and you choke

Well it ain't so scary on my own

Tell me honey, what's a dagger without a cloak?

I don't know 'cause
You and I both know that the house is haunted
And you and I both know that the ghost is me
You used to catch me in your bed sheets just rattlin your chains
Well back then baby, it didn't seem so strange


In the midnight hour you came alive

I was lookin' for my crystal ball

I was busy tryin' to charm that snake ssss
When the sun came up we had no place to hide

And you had to tell your friends that my fangs were fake

I just had to

You and I both know that the house is haunted
And you and I both know that the ghost is me
You used to catch me in your bed sheets just rattlin your chains
Well back then baby, it didn't seem so strange

Even when one is dead and gone
It still takes two to make a house a home
Well I'm as lonesome as the catacombs
I hear you call my name but no one is there
Except a feeling in the air

You and I both know that the house is haunted
Yeah you and I both know that the ghost is you
Used to walk around screaming, all slamming all 'dem doors
Well I'm all grown up now, I don't scare easy no more

Yeah, you and I both know
Oooohh
Yeah, you and I both know
Oooohh
Yeah, you and I both know
Oooohh
Oooohh
---------------------------------------------------
Merrily we fall
Out of line, out of line
I'd fall anywhere with you
I'm by your side
Swinging in the rain
Humming melodies
We're not going anywhere until we freeze

I'm not afraid, anymore
I'm not afraid

Forever is a long time
But I wouldn't mind spending it by your side

Carefully we'll place for our destiny
You came and you took this heart, and set it free
Every word you write or sing
Is so warm to me, so warm to me
I'm torn, I'm torn to be right where you are

I'm not afraid, anymore
I'm not afraid

Forever is a long time
But I wouldn't mind spending it by your side
Tell me everyday I get to wake up to that smile
I wouldn't mind it at all
I wouldn't mind it at all

You so know me
Pinch me gently
I can hardly breathe

Forever is a long, long time
But I wouldn't mind spending it by your side
Tell me everyday I get to wake up to that smile
I wouldn't mind it at all
I wouldn't mind it at all
---------------------------------------------------
So one of these nights and about twelve o'clock
This old world's going to reel and rock
Saints will tremble and cry for pain
For the Lord's gonna come in his heavenly airplane

If God had a name, what would it be?
And would you call it to his face
If you were faced with Him in all His glory?
What would you ask if you had just one question?

And yeah, yeah, God is great
Yeah, yeah, God is good
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

What if God was one of us?
Just a slob like one of us?
Just a stranger on the bus
Trying to make His way home?

If God had a face, what would it look like?
And would you want to see
If seeing meant that you would have to believe
In things like Heaven and in Jesus and the saints
And all the prophets? And...

Yeah, yeah, God is great
Yeah, yeah, God is good
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

What if God was one of us
Just a slob like one of us
Just a stranger on the bus
Trying to make His way home?

Tryin' to make His way home
Back up to Heaven all alone
Nobody callin' on the phone
'Cept for the Pope, maybe, in Rome

Yeah, yeah, God is great
Yeah, yeah, God is good
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

What if God was one of us
Just a slob like one of us
Just a stranger on the bus
Trying to make His way home?

Just tryin' to make His way home
Like a holy rolling stone
Back up to Heaven all alone
Just tryin' to make His way home
Nobody callin' on the phone
'Cept for the Pope, maybe, in Rome
---------------------------------------------------
Five, four, three, two, one, ah!

You were a child crawlin' on your knees toward it
Makin' Mama so proud, but your voice is too loud
We like to watch you laughin'
You pick the insects off plants, no time to think of consequences

Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted
Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted

The water is warm, but it's sendin' me shivers
A baby is born, cryin' out for attention
The memories fade like lookin' through a fogged mirror
Decision to decisions are made and not bought
But I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot, I guess not

Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted
Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted

Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted
Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted

Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted
Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees
---------------------------------------------------
I don't like waiting for a knock on the door
I don't like wondering why
I got no mercy for a man and his tears
He's just living a lie
I got a feeling like I'm losing my cool
That's no way to be
You got me crying, got me playing the fool
That's what you're doing to me

Ohhh, you gotta come back baby
I don't want to say how long it's been
Five days and I gotta know now
Come back baby
I don't want to live alone again
My old man never told me how

I don't like lying all alone in my bed
Nobody calling my name
I can't say thank you for a kick in the head
But I need you just the same
See me settin' by the side of the road
People starin' and smilin'
They got no mercy for a man and his tears
Can't you hear me cryin'?

Ohhh, you gotta come back baby
I don't want to say how long it's been
Five days and I gotta know now
Come back baby
I don't want to live alone again
My old man never told me how

You gotta come back baby
I don't want to say how long it's been
Five days and I gotta know now
Come back baby
I don't want to live alone again
My old man never told me how

Yeah (Yeah), yeah (Woah, woah, woah)
I (Woah, woah, woah, woah)
I (Yeah)
Ayy

Walkin' dripped out, you see the details
I got water on me, drippin' like a seashell
I gave her lust, she wanted love, I told her, "Oh, well"
When I was broke, I busted traps straight off my Nextel
What you gon' do when you make it?
Lot of people change when it comes to being famous
Fifty thousand cash in my pockets when I lane switch
I'm a rich nigga, I won't fuck her if she basic
She a rich bitch, cut a nigga off for fakin'

Nightmare on Elm street, I kill Freddy like I'm Jason
Hardly ever sleep, I told the doctor I'm dream chasin'
I gave her the addy, she popped up and we got faded
Ten minutes later she was naked, ass shakin'
Real rockstar, them pretenders just be playin'
If I got a problem, then my brother get to sprayin'
Don't care what he say, we gon' catch him where he layin'
And I'ma boss up on any occasion
Young nigga poppin' tags
Young nigga got a bag and he got his own swag, let's go
Young nigga stay low, got a lot of pesos
And he sellin' out shows, you know
I'ma die for the gang, spent like eighty on my chain
Tryna snatch it, take your brain
Big smoke nigga, you ain't never help your mans
Hit a lick for twenty bands, that put ten up in his hands
You a ho nigga

And I'm livin' by the code
I got hoes down the road, when I'm bored sell my soul
Hear me on the radio, girl, I'm in my glow
I got money and the flow, it look like I'm sellin' dope
Why your baby-daddy broke? That nigga is a joke
I should probably put him on, but I probably really won't
Call Stan send a boat, the gang stay afloat
Got bread by the loaf, turn a pussy nigga toast
I'm too nice with this
She wanna come suck, I told her, "Come ride the dick"
My gang on full attack, this that real riot shit
You fuck around, get clapped, tryna high five and shit
I don't wanna talk about it, 'cause I just do it
You would rather tweet about it, nigga just stupid
I be with a bad bitch, break her heart, cupid
Done livin' average, the truth was in my music

Nightmare on Elm street, I kill Freddy like I'm Jason
Hardly ever sleep, I told the doctor I'm dream chasin'
I gave her the addy, she popped up and we got faded
Ten minutes later she was naked, ass shakin'
Real rockstar, them pretenders just be playin'

Another hundred people just got off of the train
And came up through the ground,
While another hundred people just got off of the bus
And are looking around
At another hundred people who got off of the plane
And are looking at us
Who got off of the train
And the plane and the bus
Maybe yesterday.

It's a city of strangers,
Some come to work, some to play.
A city of strangers,
Some come to stare, some to stay.
And every day
The ones who stay
Can find each other in the crowded streets and the guarded parks,
By the rusty fountains and the dusty trees with the battered barks,
And they walk together past upholstered walls with the crude remarks.
And they meet at parties through the friends of friends who they never know.
"Do I pick you up or do I meet you there or shall we let it go?"
"Did you get my message? 'Cause I looked in vain."
"Can we see each other Tuesday if it doesn't rain?"
"Look, I'll call you in the morning or my service will explain."
And another hundred people just got off of the train.

You're a train ride to no importance
You're in love with hell existence
Money is all that you desire
Why don't you pack it in and retire
It's common nature you can't fool me
I'm just the money that you can't let free
Rainy day genius clouds your mind
Don't you realize the blind lead the blind

You're anti, you're antisocial

Oh mister time will you ever unwind
Or just rebuild a new design
Your claim to fame is law and order
The rich get rich, the poor get poor
You put a price tag on what you see
This one's for you, that's for me
If that's winning I'd rather lose
Why don't you listen to my senseless views

You're anti, you're antisocial
How do you feel?

You're a train ride to no importance
You're in love with hell existence
Money is all that you desire
Why don't you pack it in and retire
It's common nature you can't fool me
I'm just the money that you can't let free
Rainy day genius clouds your mind
Don't you realize the blind lead the blind

You're anti, you're antisocial

ANTISOCIAL......

When I was small
We had nothing at all
We used to eat Grits, for dinner
It was pain
almost drive a man insane
what we could find for
to survive another day
but I said nah...


An old killa bee once hummed me a tune
Stay up at night, don't sleep on ya moon
Four seeds in the bed, eight seeds in the room
Afternoon cartoon, we would fight for the spoon
Old Earth in the kitchen, yell "it's time to eat"
Across the foyer, ya hear the gather of stampeding feet
One pound box of sugar, and a stick of margarine
A hot pot of Grits got my family from starvin'
Loose with the welfare cheese, thick wit' the gravy
used to suck it, straight out the bottle as a baby
Steamy hot meal serve less than five minutes
Big silver pot, boilin' water, salt in it
House full of brothers and sisters, the pop's missin'
Pillsbury box on the stove in the kitchen




Young shorties in my hood started hustlin'
Packin' bags at the neighbourhood associate
Growin' up, not as fortunate to have that fly shit
I'm too young, no jobs'd hire me legit
You walkin' down the street with ya gun in ya hand
Drinkin, thinkin' of a masterplan
Your Old Earth can't afford what ya friends got
So you roll up to the spot, with ya thing 'pon cock
And it seems worth the takin', stomach achin'
Morning star Reggie makin' go good with the Grits
Now let's take it back for real
when we used to build at ghetto big wheels
with the shoppin' cart wheels, and wood to nail the seat on
Girls skippin' rope in the street
the Summer heat, left the jelly prints stuck to they feet
Skelly chief, flippin' baseball cards for keeps
Momma said it's gettin' late, and it's time to come eat
---------------------------------------------------
Nineteen, your eyes are glowing to my beating heart
Oh, it seems like it is fine as my hand is moving up your arm
And you never really know where it goes up until it starts
I got my eye on you, what you gonna do?
Daydream near a stream with the linear bites
Oh, I listen to the song on repeat from the other night
And I can't picture you, but I sure got the feeling right
What a crazy world, pretty little girl

And we wake from the night in a bed with a bruise
And we're laughing out loud over the craziest news
And you reached for my hand, I was scared in your room
We fell on the floor and we started to move
And your hands were like birds as they flew from the coop
Up my back, they would climb just as I came unglued


She said, "If you break my heart, then I'll change your mind
And I'll do it again"
If you play the part, then I will play mine
And I'll do it again
If we miss the mark, if we hold on tight
We'll be there to try it again


Nineteen as we roll across the bedroom floor
Your eyes, they cannot lie, as you're dreaming of our future home
And the kids are growing up, as you and I, we are growing old
What a crazy world, pretty little girl

In the rain, with the drink from the back of the bar
I would raise up my voice, you would raise it up more
We'd forget that our lives being apart, it is hard
We'd thought we were close, but it still feels far
Can we learn to get by if we learn to have scars?
If we learn to forgive and accept who we are


She said, "If you break my heart, then I'll change your mind
And I'll do it again"
If you play the part, then I will play mine
And I'll do it again
If we miss the mark, if we hold on tight
We'll be here to do it again


Wait a minute, hold up a second
Don't leave me here with this feeling, like I'm the one full of regret
Like I never did good for us both, like you never did
Pull out that weapon
And stick that knife in my back, was I supposed to accept it
When your words are like
More than just sticks and stones, kinda like a bullet
A hollow tip that's lodged in my bones, and I can't just swallow it
My pride is more than all that I own, so I gotta give it away
And some of the times I'm all the way wrong
But can't you see past me and see my fucked up home
That made me the meanest, the devil is just singing along
To the song I write 'til I'm alone at night
And I hang up the phone and bite my tongue
'Cause I know that me and you is just only right, but
One, one, one, one


It's a cry from the past, we have been through a lot
Every year has been great and a few have been tough
And your kids, they will reach for the stars up above
We'll sit and relax as we're cheering them on
The ropes to the light from the crib to the grave
We started alone, in the end we're okay


She said, "If you break my heart, then I'll change your mind
And I'll do it again"
If you play the part, then I will play mine
And I'll do it again
If we miss the mark, if we hold on tight
We'll be there to try it again

Gimme the rum with the chaser

There's so much left to say
Before you walk away from me
And you know that I would get
Down on my knees and pray to God
And you know that I will try
And you know that I would die for you
And you know that I would take a bullet
Just to save your life
Just to save your life
It's hard to turn back time
It's hard to say goodbye

Even though we are miles apart tonight
I know we can make it right
So just give it a chance
And we can keep it together

And every time I think of you
And after all that we've been through
'Cause no one ever
No one ever, ever compares to you
And my mind is spinning in circles
And my thoughts are running wild
And you know that I would take a bullet
Just to save your life
Just to save your life
It's hard to turn back time
It's hard to say goodbye

Even though we are miles apart tonight
I know we can make it right
So just give it a chance
And we can keep it together

So just hold on tight never let me
Go this time never let me

Even though we are miles apart tonight
I know we can make it right
So just give it a chance
And we can keep it together

Just hold on tight and don't let go
We can make it if we just hold on
Just hold on tight and don't let go
We can make it if we just hold on
And we can keep it together yeah
And we can keep it together yeah

So just hold on tight
Never let me go this time
Never let me go
---------------------------------------------------
They're playing our song
They're playing our song
Can you see the lights?
Can you hear the hum,
of our song?

I hope they get it right
I hope we dance tonight
Before we, get it wrong

And the seasons
Will change us new
But you're the best I've known
and you know me
I could not be stuck on you
If it weren't true

I was swimming
My eyes were dark
'til you woke me
And told me that opening
is just the start
It was

Now I see you, 'til kingdom come
You're the one I want
to see me for all
the stupid shit I've done

Soil and six feet under,
Kept just like we were
Before you knew you'd know me
and you know me

Blooming up from the ground
3 rounds and a sound
Like whispering "you know me.
You know me."

So this was our song
This was our song.
I still see the lights
I can see them

And the crisscross
Of what is true, won't get to us
'Cause you know me-
I could not give up on you...

And the fog of
what is right
Won't cover us
'cause you know me-
I could not give up a fight...

Soil and six feet under
(Crisscross of what is true, won't get to us)
Kept just like we were
(Cause you know me. I could not give up on you)
Before you knew you'd know me
(But you feel the truth)
And you know me

Blooming up from the ground
(And the fog of what is right won't cover us)
3 rounds and a sound
(Cause you know me, I could not give up a fight)
Like whispering "you know me
(But you feel right)
You know me."
---------------------------------------------------
Every day's a blur
Sometimes I can't tell what day it is
Don't know what day it is
Can you tell me what day it is?
Life's passing by
'Cause I'm out chasing empty highs
Every hello just means goodbye
But I'm looking for more this time

Can we start to slow it down?
Can we learn to live right now?
I just want to feel it all, ah-ooh

I'm a Ferrari pulled off on Mulholland Drive
Over the city, the lights are so pretty from up here
I'm a Ferrari and after the party's done
I keep on going, missing the moments
Living in the fast lane's getting kinda lonely (Yeah)

(Oh-oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-oh-ooh)
Living in the fast lane's getting kinda lonely
(Oh-oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-oh-ooh)
Living in the fast lane's getting kinda lonely

Got a heavy heart
'Cause it's still beating on its own
Might be going out in the crowd
But I'm still coming home alone
Not tryna to say
I'm not grateful for everything
I'm just going too fast to see
All the good things in front of me

I'm a Ferrari pulled off on Mulholland Drive
Over the city, the lights are so pretty from up here
I'm a Ferrari (I'm a Ferrari) and after the party's done
I keep on going, missing the moments
Living in the fast lane's getting kinda lonely

(Oh-oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-oh-ooh)
Living in the fast lane's getting kinda lonely
(Oh-oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-oh-ooh)

I'm a Ferrari pulled off on Mulholland Drive
Over the city, the lights are so pretty from up here
I'm a Ferrari and after the party's done
I keep on going, missing the moments
Living in the fast lane's getting kinda lonely
---------------------------------------------------
Sientate conmigo aqui,
Sientate te quiero hablar..
Es claro lo que paso,
Es que te deje de amar..
Mucho tiempo sin saber
Que es lo que querias vos,
Pero yo sabia en mi
Que es lo que queria yo..
Nada.. nada volvera a ser lo que fue..
Puras ilusiones sin saber,
Cuanto tiempo mas para entender
Que esto fue ayer..
Mucho tiempo te espere,
Y sigo sentado aqui,
Pasa el tiempo y mi cancion
Ya no suena como ayer..
Marchitandome estoy,
Si sigo pensando asi,
Si detengo al corazon
Por lo que ya yo te di..
Nada.. nada volvera a ser lo que fue
Puras ilusiones sin saber,
Cuanto tiempo mas para entender
Que esto fue ayer..
---------------------------------------------------
Run to the light
It won't save you tonight
All our yesterdays are pictures lost in time
Never enough
Towers crumble to dust
Looking back on the moments of our lives

All your anger, all your hurt
Doesn't matter in the end
Those days go by
And we all start again
What you had and what you lost
They're all memories in the wind
Those days go by
And we all start again

Stars still burn bright
Seasons change overnight
As we find our way, the times, they come and go
Look back in love
A new day rises above
With a wind that comes to carry you back home

All your anger, all your hurt
Doesn't matter in the end
Those days go by
And we all start again
What you had and what you lost
They're all memories in the wind
Those days go by
And we all start again

Days go by!

All your anger, all your hurt
Doesn't matter in the end
Those days go by
And we all start again
What you had and what you lost
They're all memories in the wind
Those days go by
And we all start again

What you had and what you lost
What you had and what you lost

Those days go by
Those days go by
Those days go by

---------------------------------------------------
Everybody's talking at me
I can't hear a word they're saying
Only the echoes of my mind
People stopping staring
I can't see their faces
Only the shadows of their eyes

I'm going where the sun keeps shining
Through the pouring rain
Going where the weather suits my clothes
Tacking off of the North East winds
Sailing on a summer breeze
And skipping over the ocean like a stone

Oh...

I'm going where the sun keeps shining
Through the pouring rain
Going where the weather suits my clothes
Tacking off of the North East winds
Sailing on a summer breeze
And skipping over the ocean like a stone

Everybody's talking at me
I can't hear a word they're saying
Only the echoes of my mind
And I don't want to leave my love behind
No, I won't let you leave
I don't want to leave my love behind
---------------------------------------------------
Me la paso recordando
Tus lindos besos y tus labios
Cuando me miran tan despacio
Se me echa a pedazos

El corazon a la 2 de la manana
Sabe ya que vamo' a hacer
Tranquilita y yo voy suave ya, bebe
Muevete como ya sabes
No hay que ensenarte

Relax, que vamo' a hacer
Lo que tu quiera' hacer
Y ya tu sabe lo que va a ser

Relax, que vamo' a hacer
Lo que tu quiera' hacer
Y ya tu sabe

To' lo que tu quieras saber
To' lo que tu quieras saber

Me hipnotizas al solo mirarme
Te quitas la ropa tan interesante
La tire para la cama y le dije
Que esto es el amanecer

Que se mete la cabeza hasta los pies (Pies)
Vamos a hacer el S-E-X (Sex)
Te voy a hacer mia poco a poco
Me dice que estoy loco, loco, loco

Relax, que vamo' a hacer
Lo que tu quiera' hacer
Y ya tu sabe lo que va a ser

Relax, que vamo' a hacer
Lo que tu quiera' hacer
Y ya tu sabe

To' lo que tu quieras saber
To' lo que tu quieras saber

All I wanna do is go between them legs
And put down your head
And put in work, baby

All I wanna do is go between them legs
And put down your head
Put in work, baby

Relax, que vamo' a hacer
Lo que tu quiera' hacer
Y ya tu sabe

To' lo que tu quieras saber
To' lo que tu quieras saber

Ready? go, 1,2,3,4

If you want me to
I will be the one
That is always good
And you'll love me too
But you'll never know
What I feel inside
That I'm really bad
Little trouble girl
Remember mother?
We were close
Very, very close
Sha la la you taught me how to fit it good
Sha la la flow down life you understood
Sha la la curl my hair and eye lash
Sha la la hitch my cheeks and do my lips
Sha la la swing my hips just like you
Sha la la smile and behave
Sha la la a circle of perfection, it's what you gave
Sha la la then one day I met a guy
He stole my heart, no alibi
Sha la la he said: "Romance is a ticket to paradise"
Sha la la momma, I'm not too young to try
Sha la la we kissed, we hugged, we were close
Very, very close
Sha la la we danced in the sand
And the water rose - higher and higher
Sha la la until I found myself floating - in the sky
I'm sorry mother, I'd rather fight
Than have to lie
If you want me to
I will be the one
That is always good
And you'll love me too
But you'll never know
What I feel inside
That I'm really bad
Little trouble girl
Little trouble girl (what you doin'?)
Little trouble girl cross my heart and hope to die,
Little trouble girl I can not tell a lie
Little trouble girl ah-hu
Little trouble girl ah-hu
Little trouble girl ah-hu
Little trouble girl ah-hu
Little trouble girl ah-hu
Little trouble girl ah-hu
Little trouble girl ah-hu
Little trouble girl ah-hu
---------------------------------------------------
Yeah, I take my baby down to the street and I buy him a soda-pop
He's so sweet

Alright now, alright now, alright now
You said that

If you want I'll be the one
Take you out and have some fun
I never never ever ever tell no one
Till the end, till the morning comes

Yeah, I take my baby down to the corner and
I buy him a soda-pop
Hmm hmm

Alright now, alright now, alright now

If you want I'll be the one
Take you out and have some fun
Flip a quarter for the toss
I'd like mine with apple-sauce

Yeah, I take my baby down to the corner and
I buy him a soda-pop
'Cause he's so neat, sweet

Alright now, alright now, alright now
Okay now

If you want I'll be the one
Shake my legs and have some fun
My hearts spinnin' round like a washing machine
Never saw the devil look so damn clean

Yeah, I take my baby down to the corner and
I buy him a soda-pop
And he said: "honey, you look so fine"
And I said: okay, alright, okay, alright

I was walking up Lafayette street
It's real empty
And I looked out and it turned into a big field
And I looked up in the sky
And I looked up in the clouds
And I saw this face looking down at me
And it's a women's face
And she threw a quarter down at me and she said:
"Honey, here's a quarter go put it in the washing machine"
And then I looked up at her,
I looked up
---------------------------------------------------
How far can I go
From the edge of what I know
And if I go back
Could it ever be the same

Oh the wind, The wind, it blows
Could you take me to the coast?
Boat me on a ship
I would just sail

Moving on
New morning
Moving on
New morning
Moving on
New morning
Moving on, Moving on

How far can I go
From the edge of what I know
Moving on
Moving on
How far can I go
From the edge of what I know
Moving on
---------------------------------------------------
Used it all for takes
But your heart maybe matters
And desire on your fate
With your fear where'd you after

Somewhere you keep up your halo
Scared of what they don't know
Open up your window shades
And illuminate

Illuminate
Let nothing in your way
Illuminate
Go on and shine on (Oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh)

Go on and shine on (Oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh)
Go on and shine on (Oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh)
Go on and shine on (Oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh)
Go

Is your sanity poor?
Cause you're starving for a reason
Make your sickness your cure
You invent what you believe in

Somewhere you keep up your halo
Scared of what they don't know
Open up your window shades
And illuminate

Illuminate
Let nothing in your way
Illuminate
Go on and shine on (Oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh)

Go on and shine on (Oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh)
Go (Oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh)

And Illuminate
Illuminate
Let nothing in your way
Illuminate
Go on and shine on

Go on and shine on
Go on and shine on (Oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh)
Go on and shine on (Oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh)
Go
---------------------------------------------------
Good evening one and all, we're all so glad to see you here
We'll play your favourite songs while you all soak up the atmosphere
We'll start with 'Old Man River', then maybe 'Stormy Weather', too
I'm sure you know just what to do
On with the show, good health to you

Please pour another glass, it's time to watch the cabaret
Your wife will never know that you're not really working late
Your hostess here is Wendy, you'll find her very friendly, too
And we don't care just what you do
On with the show good health to you

Betina starts the show at 2 o'clock

Oh, if by chance you find that you can't make it anymore
We'll put you in a cab and get you safely to the door
But we've got all the answers and we've got lovely dancers, too
There's nothin' else you have to do
On with the show, good health to you

You're all such lovely people dancing, eating 'round the floor
But if you have to fight, please take your trouble out the door
For now I say with sorrow until this time tomorrow
We'll bid you all a fond adieu
On with the show, good health to you
---------------------------------------------------
Saturday you wake up
Grab a coffee cup
Read the morning paper
And realised you're stuck

Yeah you are stuck
Stuck

You catch a couple hours
Of poisonous TV
You crawl into the shower
And look around and see

That you are stuck
Stuck

So shoot me down, shoot me down my love
I messed around, I messed around so much
Shoot me down when you've had enough, ohhh

Saturday you wake up
You're sticking to the floor
You try to make some sense of
A hundred things or more

That you are stuck
Stuck
Yeah you are stuck
Stuck

So shoot me down, shoot me down my love
I messed around, I fucked around so much
Shoot me down when you've had enough, ohhh
Shoot me down, shoot me down my love

But oh, just keep holding on
Just keep holding on
The sun's been and gone
And we're all just beginning
Oh, just keep holding on
Just keep holding on
The sun's been and gone
And we're all just beginning
Yeah we're all just beginning
Yeah we're all just beginning
Ohhh

Yeah we are stuck
Stuck
Yeah we are stuck
Stuck
---------------------------------------------------
I don't have a home
Living at my friend's
I feel so alone
This is all my fault


Look a mess and I'm best with you
Should I take a rest or invest in you?
Fuck your ex and the next bitch too
They don't really do what I can do for you
Kinda hard when I work a lot
And you the only one that ever hit that spot
I don't beg but I'm on my knees
'Cause you the only one that get me out them jeans

I know I fucked up
When you said you liked her
And I kinda pushed you away
Told you I hate you
But I can't replace you
And now I been crashing all day
I am not hating
But she overrated
And I cannot fake it no more
I'd rather call ya
And tell ya come over
And fuck like ain't nothing went wrong

Look a mess and I'm best with you
Should I take a rest or invest in you?
Fuck your ex and the next bitch too

I don't beg but I'm on my knees
'Cause you the only one that get me out them jeans

Passion in the talk when I spit to you

---------------------------------------------------
Man, I'm so bored
One, two, three, uh

I don't wanna look at my phone anymore
I don't wanna roll like a stone anymore
I cannot hear my thoughts in this silence no more
Bring back the noise, bring back the noise
I guess I must've been in my room for too long
Black flags, red fronts, in my eyes for too long
We gon' be alright, they don't play it no more
Play it no more, don't play it no more

Tick-tock, I just woke up and I don't know what's the time
No one's looking at the clock 'cause there's nowhere to climb
Tick-tock, I just woke up and there's no news on TV
No more selling stuff for money, everybody's free

Man, I'm so bored, uh

I don't wanna look at my phone anymore
I don't wanna roll like a stone anymore
I can't hear my thoughts in this silence no more
Bring back the noise, bring back the noise
Somebody came in and broke the lock
We didn't even notice we were stuck
It's like, clean your nose, smell the rose
Body but don't overdose
Hold your hose, pick a pose, universe slows

Tick-tock, I just woke up, and I don't know what's the time
(Tell ya, we got nothing to lose)
No one's looking at the clock 'cause there's nowhere to climb
Tick-tock, I just woke up, and there's no news on TV
(Tell ya, we got nothing to lose)
No more selling stuff for money, everybody's free

Come out, play with your enemies
Come out, play with your enemies
Come out, play with your enemies
Come out, play with your enemies

Tick-tock, I just woke up, and I don't know what's the time
(Tell ya, we got nothing to lose)
No one's looking at the clock 'cause there's nowhere to climb
Tick-tock, I just woke up, and there's no news on TV
(Tell ya, we got nothing to lose)
No more selling stuff for money, everybody's free
---------------------------------------------------
Rebirth, feet hit the earth
My knees hurt
They're weaker than
Previously, her breathing seems to be burnt like
Free CDs were before we
Could be searched
I'm like please, just please work
Like a lenient slave owner
That's edgy like gravestones
Oh, you get me
I saved dough for a Bentley
Two percent there already
I may go for a Chevy
'Cause who cares about flexin' if you ain't holding it heavy
Uh, I've been trying' to prove to all of the people I knew
Who didn't like what I do
Disgusted like "ew"
Yeah, this shit goes outta you
Plans have now all become true
Seeing them through
Man, that's the reason I do
All of the things that I do
It's not for a crew
Not for a God or a demon
I've really been needing a clue
Filling these shoes
Reading these pieces and news
Damn this shit really is screwed
It gives me the blues
Whenever I'm shielding my eyes from the darkness and don't get a view, uh
But if ignorance is really bliss
Then why this ignorance be killin' kids
And why's this ignorance is truly vicious it's not giving shit and ends up innocent
That shit really is ridiculous it's magnificently
Fucked up
But nobody wants to tough it up
I've even seen it goin down, it's comin' up, like
Let it go
Sense of self is really all I know
But one day it will all work out
That is all I hope, all I hope
Yeah

And I do not want to go away
Go away from you
But I know that there's no escape
No escape, from the truth
I guess I must show the way
Go today will do
Just one thing that's so mundane
But so amazing too, yeah
Just let the wind blow, yeah
Just let the wind blow, yeah
Open a window, yeah
Just let the wind blow, uh
Let the wind blow
Just let the wind blow
Open a window, yeah, uh

Vaycay to the Vatican, having them
Good times and bad times
With new Romans do that again
Well that was when
I was so young
Too young to really know fun
But so what?
I guess that's what happens when you grow up
Dry your eyes and wipe your nose up
Just keep drinking 'til you throw up
No, we won't judge
But we all just want to be loved
And somehow get validated by those we hate
Such a twisted system that we've been given to operate
I've been really thinking and figuring out who's not a fake
Wash away the thoughts I made along the way it all has changed
And now I'm looking, it's so far away
And it's so far away

Do you want to rule the world?
Or do you just want to sit there?
If you want to rule the world, you should probably start right now

And I do not want to go away
Go away from you
But I know that there's no escape
No escape, from the truth
I guess I must show the way
Go today will do
Just one thing that's so mundane
But so amazing too, yeah
Just let the wind blow, yeah
Just let the wind blow, yeah
Open a window, yeah
Just let the wind blow, uh
Let the wind blow
Just let the wind blow
Open a window, yeah

Your love is like no other

Our love to be forever

I want no other lover
Our love will be forever

Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes
Each one she passes goes - ah

When she walks, she's like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gentle
That when she passes
Each one she passes goes - ooh

(Ooh) But I watch her so sadly
How can I tell her I love her
Yes I would give my heart gladly
But each day, when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at me

Tall, (and) tan, (and) young, (and) lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, I smile
But she doesn't see (doesn't see)
(She just doesn't see, she never sees me...)
---------------------------------------------------
Waking up I see that everything is OK
The first time in my life and now it's so great
Slowing down I look around and I am so amazed
I think about the little things that make life great

I wouldn't change a thing about it
This is the best feeling

This innocence is brilliant
I hope that it will stay
This moment is perfect
Please don't go away
I need you now
And I'll hold on to it
Don't you let it pass you by

I found a place so safe, not a single tear
The first time in my life and now it's so clear
Feel calm, I belong, I'm so happy here
It's so strong and now I let myself be sincere

I wouldn't change a thing about it
This is the best feeling

This innocence is brilliant
I hope that it will stay
This moment is perfect
Please don't go away
I need you now
And I'll hold on to it
Don't you let it pass you by

It's a state of bliss, you think you're dreaming
It's the happiness inside that you're feeling
It's so beautiful it makes you wanna cry

It's a state of bliss, you think you're dreaming
It's the happiness inside that you're feeling
It's so beautiful it makes you wanna cry

It's so beautiful it makes you wanna cry

This innocence is brilliant
It makes you wanna cry
This innocence is brilliance
Please don't go away
'Cause I need you now
And I'll hold on to it
Don't you let it pass you by

(It's so beautiful it makes you wanna cry)

This innocence is brilliant
(It's so beautiful)
(It's so beautiful)
I hope that it will stay
This moment is perfect
Please don't go away
I need you now
(It makes me wanna cry)
And I'll hold on to it
Don't you let it pass you by
---------------------------------------------------
You stood behind the counter
Walked up, keeping my head down
Something, something that moved me now
I shot straight as an arrow
You caught me in your bullseye
Who knew, two could've fit so right?

Oh my love, love is beginning
We have found something worth living for
I've got my head in the clouds
Oh my love, love is beginning now
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh

So let's start carving our own path
One day it will become a road
We'll drive down to the countryside
Oh, look how the colors are changing
New stars appear in the night sky
This heart is starting to come to life

Oh my love, love is beginning
We have found something worth living for
I've got my head in the clouds
Oh my love, love is beginning
Oh my love, love is beginning
We have found something worth living for
I've got my head in the clouds
Oh my love, love is beginning now
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh

Oh my love, love is beginning
We have found something worth living for
I've got my head in the clouds
Oh my love, love is beginning
Oh my love, love is beginning

We have found something worth living for
I've got my head in the clouds
Oh my love, love is beginning now
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh
Love is beginning now
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh
Love is beginning now
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh
Love is beginning now
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh
Love is beginning now

Oh life, it's bigger
It's bigger than you
And you are not me
The lengths that I will go to
The distance in your eyes
Oh no, I've said too much
I set it up

That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

Every whisper
Of every waking hour
I'm choosing my confessions
Trying to keep an eye on you
Like a hurt, lost and blinded fool, fool
Oh no, I've said too much
I set it up

Consider this
Consider this, the hint of the century
Consider this, the slip
That brought me to my knees, failed
What if all these fantasies come
Flailing around
Now I've said too much

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

But that was just a dream
That was just a dream

That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

But that was just a dream
Try, cry, why try
That was just a dream
Just a dream
Just a dream, dream

Drivin' solo, I'm just swervin' through my ends
When I'm sober I just don't like who I am
Pour me up a 4 and I'll feel like myself again
Roll me up some dope and I'll feel like myself again
I'ma break every box they try to put me in
I got a lot of enemies who used to be my friends
Pour me up a 4 and I'll feel like myself again
Roll me up some dope and I'll feel like myself again

I was sober for an hour but I'm rollin' off a bean now
The drugs, they give me confidence, I'm sayin' what I mean now
The xannies help me slow up, the lean it help me speed down
Ballin', yeah I'm ballin', I won't hit it if she beat now
Callin', yeah she callin', your bitch got me on the speed dial
Driving through the Rex I look at faces don't see no smiles
It's grimy in the 6, who can I trust? I'll never know now
Sprite is extra dark now, my doggie in the dog pound
They say I'm on the come up, but I've been on the come down
See me doin' good, they start to hate, that's how it goes now
I don't know why they mad at me, I always stay ten toes down
Drivin' through my city by myself, that's how I roll now

Drivin' solo, I'm just swervin' through my ends
When I'm sober I just don't like who I am
Pour me up a 4 and I'll feel like myself again
Roll me up some dope and I'll feel like myself again
I'ma break every box they try to put me in
I got a lot of enemies who used to be my friends
Pour me up a 4 and I'll feel like myself again
Roll me up some dope and I'll feel like myself again

I remember being a kid my teachers told me I wouldn't be shit
Diamonds in my pinky, look like water, make me seasick
Never had no help so don't approach me on some free shit
Did this by myself so why the fuck would I do a remix?
His bitch gave me top, don't want the pussy, he can keep it
Money and the power, fuck respect 'cause I don't need it
Drivin' to the west, I popped a bean and now I'm speedin'
Know some people in the 6 that dissed me for no reason
Sending shots, they sendin' shots, on road I never see them
Taking Ls, they takin' Ls, I never wanna be them
Got your bitch beside me, she just asked me what a bean is
Put her number in my phone, and you know I delete it

Drivin' solo, I'm just swervin' through my ends
When I'm sober I just don't like who I am
Pour me up a 4 and I'll feel like myself again
Roll me up some dope and I'll feel like myself again
I'ma break every box they try to put me in
I got a lot of enemies who used to be my friends
Pour me up a 4 and I'll feel like myself again
Roll me up some dope and I'll feel like myself again

Drivin' solo, I'm just swervin' through my ends
Pour me up a 4 and I'll feel like myself again
I'ma break every box they try to put me in
Pour me up a 4 and I'll feel like myself again
Roll me up some dope and I'll feel like myself again

Drivin' solo, I'm just swervin' through my ends

You say I only hear what I want to
You say I talk so all the time. So?

And I thought what I felt was simple
And I thought that I don't belong
And now that I am leaving
Now I know that I did something wrong 'cause I missed you
Yeah, I missed you

And you say I only hear what I want to:
I don't listen hard
I don't pay attention to the distance that you're running
to anyone, anywhere
I don't understand if you really care
I'm only hearing negative: no, no, no (bad)

So I, I turned the radio on, I turned the radio up
And this woman was singin' my song:
The lover's in love and the other's run away
Lover is crying 'cause the other won't stay

Some of us hover when we weep for the other who was
Dying since the day they were born
Well. Well, this is not that:
I think that I'm throwing, but I'm thrown

And I thought I'd live forever, but now I'm not so sure

You try to tell me that I'm clever
But that won't take me anyhow, or anywhere with you

You said that I was naive
And I thought that I was strong
I thought, "Hey, I can leave, I can leave."
Oh, but now I know that I was wrong, 'cause I missed you
Yeah, I missed you

You said you caught me 'cause you want me
And one day you'd let me go
You try to give away a keeper, or keep me 'cause you know you're just so scared to lose
And you say, "Stay."

And you say I only hear what I want to
---------------------------------------------------
Tell me, baby
Do you still feel the way you did?
'Cause I can't tell, baby
No, I can't tell what's in your head
But I don't know where to turn
But if you wanna' change your mind
I'll take you and we'll run

Black magic, come on
Just let me on now, I believe
Black magic, come on

You know it's crazy, baby
How I still see you in my sleep
And I can't shift the way you're always on my mind, mind
But I don't know where to turn
But if you wanna' change your mind
I'll take you and we'll run

Black magic, come on
Just let me on now I believe
Black magic, come on

Don't you let me at all
When I've given all I've got to give
Black magic, come on

Do you still feel the way you did?
Do you still feel the way you did?
---------------------------------------------------

Saat ku merindu
Terasa dalam di relung hati
Apakah hanya diriku
Yang merasakan rindu sendiri

Aku harus bagaimana?
Aku bisa apa?
Untuk tahu isi hatimu

Oh rinduku padamu
Padamu kasihku
Pujaan hatiku
Dan kau
Rindukah kau padaku?
Ku ingin melepas rindu
Meski ku
Semakin bertemu
Semakin ku rindu

Sungguh ingin sekali rasanya
Genggam tanganmu menjadi nyata
Jangan kemana-mana
Ajak aku tuk slalu bahagia

Oh rinduku padamu
Padamu kasihku
Pujaan hatiku
Dan kau
Rindukah kau padaku?
Ku ingin melepas rindu
Meski ku
Semakin bertemu

Oh rinduku padamu
Padamu kasihku
Pujaan hatiku
dan ku ingin pastikan kau
Rindukah kau padaku?
Ku ingin melepas rindu
Meski ku, Semakin bertemu
Semakin ku rindu

Oh.. meski ku
Semakin bertemu
Semakin ku rindu

Say something awful
as if fucking the world is your right
And I watch you stumble
drunk out into the night.

To catcall ladies,
you're thirsty for blood
you're picking a fight
And I wanted to ask you
"Man, what do you do in the daylight?"

So bum me a cigarette,
Buy me a beer,
'Til I'm happy to be here,
Happy to be here

With all of my family
Hookers in heels
and the men who watch them
like hungry black eels

Run into me Sunday
Tell me you had one hell of a time
And through the haze and the gunsmoke
I'm forced to believe you're probably right

And someone lies bleeding
Someone got violent and did not think twice
And I watched you my brother
Making a fool of the moon tonight

So bum me a cigarette,
Buy me a beer,
'Til I'm happy to be here,
Happy to be here

With all of my family
Hookers in heels
and the men who watch them
like hungry black eels

Am I just a spark?
---------------------------------------------------
Hold on
Two halves past and Colorado
Every night
It's five
You hold on
Terrified what's gonna happen
Try it again
Twelve times

I am a quiet light chaser
Ain't I painful?
It's already nightfall
Somebody was hurt
I try
I can't do right
All I've been through
Trivialized
Sigh

Hold on
Two halves past and Colorado
Every night
Predicted a precise moment
Someone once said
To cherish the fall while you're up to it

I am a quiet light chaser
Ain't I painful?
It's already nightfall
Somebody was hurt
I try
I can't do right
All I've been through
Trivialized

To you, I am a birthday sentiment
Yearly rub-it-in
Don't go caving in
Somebody dumb fooling me
With something I don't know and
I just fall into it with you

Oh
In the twist
Didn't mean to floor you
Hold me somewhere
With a lot to decide
Oh
With a lot to decide
Uh-oh

I am a quiet light chaser
Ain't I painful?
It's already nightfall
Somebody was hurt
I try
I can't do right
All I've been through
Trivialized

To you, I am a birthday sentiment
Die in increments
Until you cave in
Your broken bracelets
An easy thing to replace
Let's go away then
Gracefully
---------------------------------------------------
I am me
And I know I will always be
Je suis free
Oui, j'invente ma vie
Ne me demandez pas qui je suis
Moi je suis le meme depuis tout petit
Et malgre les regards, les avis
Je pleure, je sors et je ris

You put me in a box
Want me to be like you
Je suis pas dans les codes
Ca derange beaucoup
At the end of the day
You cannot change me, boo
Alors laisse-moi m'envoler

I, I'm not rich but I'm shining bright
I can see my kingdom now
Quand je reve, je suis un roi
Quand je reve, je suis un roi
I'm not rich but I'm shining bright
I can see my kingdom now
Quand je reve, je suis un roi

And I kno-o-o-ow
Even tho-o-o-ough
You tried to take me down
You can not break me, na, na
Toutes ces voix
Fait comme ci, fait comme ca
Moi je ne cala pas
You will never remove my crown

Who are we?
When we hurt, when we fight for free
Only God can judge you and me
Ce qu'on est, on ne l'a pas choisi
On choisit
Son travail, sa coiffure, ses amis
Sa routine, parfois l'amour aussi
Ca passe ou ca casse mais ca regarde qui?

I, I'm not rich but I'm shining bright
I can see my kingdom now
Quand je reve, je suis un roi
Quand je reve, je suis un roi
I'm not rich but I'm shining bright
I can see my kingdom now
Quand je reve, je suis un roi

And I kno-o-o-ow
Even tho-o-o-ough
You tried to take me down
You can not break me now
Toutes ces voix
Fait comme ci, fait comme ca
Moi je ne cala pas
You will never remove my crown

Je suis un roi
Quand je reve, je suis un roi
---------------------------------------------------
You know, I know
That some days are gonna be a little bit better
Who knows, how it goes
And if we ever learn

Hard days, long nights
Cold drinks are drippin' on my favorite sweater
I hope, you know
That it's our turn

When we're young like this
And we're dumb like this
Having fun like this
It's alright
To be young like this
Or feel young forever

When we're young like this
And we're dumb like this
Every night like this
It's alright
To be young like this
And stay young forever

I know, time goes
But these days, just wanna make 'em last forever
We won't remember
The nights we went to sleep
(All those nights)

And that yesterday
Is no longer tomorrow
I can't remember

That when we're young like this
And we're dumb like this
Having fun like this
It's alright
To be young like this
Or feel young forever

When we're young like this
And we're dumb like this
Every night like this
It's alright
To be young like this
And stay young forever

I've never been this old before
And I'll never be this young again

When we're young like this
And we're dumb like this
And we're wastin' time
It's alright
We can always try
To stay young forever

When we're young like this
And we're dumb like this
And we're young like this
We'll stay young forever

Oh when we're young like this
And we're dumb like this
We can always try
To stay young forever

Your voice on the phone, keep it low
Your voice on the phone, keep it low
Your voice on the phone, keep it low
Keep it low

If you want to stay I will put you up
I've been in the shadow you are in now
At the dusk of the day, have I done enough
To tell myself I didn't really let you down?

In my haste to follow you
I got tortured for what I done
Found my faith in solitude
Now I don't talk to anyone

Your voice on the phone, keep it low
Your voice on the phone, keep it low
Your voice on the phone, keep it low
Keep it low
Your voice on the phone, keep it low
Give us something we can sway to
We get a lot of the day to
We got loud in the day too

Anyone can see they got a piece of us
It's better to be metal than diaphanous
Fall into a pattern of ambivalence
And calcify your heart

In my haste to follow you
I got tortured for what I done
Found my faith in solitude
Now I don't talk to anyone

Your voice on the phone, keep it low
Your voice on the phone, keep it low
Your voice on the phone, keep it low
Keep it low
Your voice on the phone, keep it low
Give us something we can sway to
If I learned a lesson from living alone
Maybe I can find another pagan to pray to
We got a lot of the day to

Your voice on the phone, keep it low
Your voice on the phone, keep it low
Your voice on the phone, keep it low
Keep it low

Cuando quiero
Ser tu sombra
Es dificil encontrar alguna luz
Mas cuando quiero
Ser tu agua
Vas a beber a otro rio a otra playa
Y aunque el agua del mar, sea salada
Te empecinas con la idea de beber
Mas no viendo que a tu lado
Una vertiente se esta convirtiendo en barro

Yo te qui, yo te qui, yo te quiero
Con raices pero en libertad
Yo te qui, yo te qui, yo te quiero
Pero hasta cuando te tendre yo que esperar

Cuando quiero ser tu estrella
Hay una luna deslumbrante que me opaca
Aunque se que no soy la mas bella
Este amor por ti hasta mata

Yo te qui, yo te qui, yo te quiero
Con raices pero en libertad
Yo te qui, yo te qui, yo te quiero
Pero hasta cuando te tendre yo que esperar

Yo te qui, yo te qui, yo te quiero
Con raices pero en libertad
Yo te qui, yo te qui, yo te quiero
Pero hasta cuando te tendre yo que esperar

Yeah
Khea Young Flex, eh
Uh-oh
Eh, eh, eh

Mami, lo siento (Lo siento)
Son verdad las cosas que te cuento (Te cuento)
No te he escrito, no he tenido tiempo (Tiempo)
Entre giras, noches, parties y conciertos, mami, lo siento

Mami, lo siento (Lo siento)
Son verdad las cosas que te cuento (Te cuento)
No te he escrito no he tenido tiempo
Entre giras, noches, parties y conciertos, mami, lo siento

Estamos, estamos, estamos jugando de en serio (En serio)
Vamos armando el imperio (Imperio)
Lo quiero todo pa' mi
Llevo el alma de guerrero, eh
La jugada la vi sin mis hermanos viviendo un infierno
Mansion pa' la mama to' lo que yo quiero

Tengo la fama, sigo siendo el mismo
Desde chico, lo digo sin filtro
Con todos mis panas contamos el dinero (Dinero)
Y de verdad

Mami, lo siento (Lo siento)
Me bajo de los vivos casi muerto (Casi muerto)
Llego de drogadera al aeropuerto (Al aeropuerto)
Lleno con falso amor lo que era nuestro (Lo que era nuestro)
Ahora esta muerto

Mami, lo siento
Sabia que iba a hacerla del comienzo
Ganar money por que rompan el dance floor
No te he escrito, no he tenido tiempo
No te miento

Otro day, new wave
Pensando en grande
Prende otra vez
Pasame el lighter
Otro day, new wave
Pensando en grande
Prende otra vez
Pasame el lighter

Mami, lo siento (Lo siento)
Son verdad las cosas que te cuento (Te cuento)
No te he escrito, no he tenido tiempo (Tiempo)
Entre giras, noches, parties y conciertos (Conciertos)

Mami, lo siento (Lo siento)
Son verdad las cosas que te cuento
No te he escrito no he tenido tiempo
Entre giras, noches, parties y conciertos
Mami, lo siento

And I'm all stoned, don't mean to compromise
But baby I'm all alone
Yeah, I stay swollen in my lips
Stung by love is all we know
Addicted to those crazy hips
And vodka that'll hit the floor
Yeah, the way she moves around the world
You could say I should have known
Why you do these things?
Got me fucked up all alone
And staring down this drink
Got me racing to the phone
And nervous while I think
I should probably wait till morning
You got me so alone, lone

Yeah, I'm cool, so sexy, this how we move
I run but you never pass the time
Saying baby don't go
Yeah I'm fast, so sweet, but I gotta last
You give it up when you see me down
This time I won't go

I've been stung, stung
Nowhere to run, run
Your ways are poison, they fill my lungs
I've been stung, stung
Nowhere to run, run
Your ways are poison, they fill my lungs

I thought we met for reasons
Years ago this seemed like fate
But now I know, now I know
You love my ups and downs
So surprised I stayed around
You used me for sure
Came to my senses, it's sounds in my tone
No mutual feelings, they're all on your own

And why you do these things?
Got me fucked up all alone
And staring down this drink
Got me racing to the phone
And nervous while I think
I should probably wait till morning
You got me so alone, lone

You stung me, I'm hurting
I feel this for certain
We opened the show strong
Now I'm closing curtains
We used to be stand outs
I'm broken my hands out
You know I always take the fall
But you're to blame here


Yeah, I'm cool, so sexy, this how we move
I run but you never pass the time
Saying baby don't go
Yeah I'm fast, so sweet, but I gotta last
You give it up when you see me down
This time I won't go

I've been stung, stung
Nowhere to run, run
Your ways are poison, they fill my lungs
I've been stung, stung
Nowhere to run, run
Your ways are poison, they fill my lungs

Ain't no one change the world
By sticking to the rules
You can't start no revbolution
By playing it safe

And we will not be held down no more
We will not be held down no more

Crazy kids were born to rule the world
Rule the world, to rule the world
Crazy kids were born to rule the world
Rule the world, we're gonna rule the world

We are the generation
Of black sheep, we are misfits
We're gonna rule this nation
We stand above your law

And we will not be held down no more
We will not be held down no more

Crazy kids were born to rule the world
Rule the world, to rule the world
Crazy kids were born to rule the world
Rule the world, we're gonna rule the world

Go ahead little mama
Do your dance little man
Break it down sister
Oh, brother take it home
Go on show 'em what you're made of
Leave it all on the floor
Break it down sister
Brother take it home

Crazy kids were born to rule the world
Rule the world, to rule the world
Crazy kids were born to rule the world
Rule the world, we're gonna rule the world

No, I don't say it often
And I probably should've told you I hurt this bad, I know
And I probably shouldn't want this so bad
It's weighing, weighing on me
Don't wanna wake up in the mornin'
Cannot undo what we did in this bed
And I can't get you out, so I gotta go
No, I'm not ready for, you want me all alone
But I'm undecided, excited, ignited
And I don't wanna feel the way I do, but I like it
Look at all these sparks flyin'
But I'm still indecisive
And she want me to wife it
But I'm undecided

I know I shouldn't be doing this, but here we go again
Girl you know that pussy is my weakness (Weakness, weakness, weakness)
Girl, you got me addicted when you switchin' positions
You tell me, "Shut up"
And you know I listen, I hit it
Wish I never did it
I can't keep sinnin' and pretendin'

I'm takin' off your clothes
We gettin' sexual
Hit it so good, think I'll propose
I don't know but

But I'm undecided, excited (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah), ignited (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I don't wanna feel the way I do, but I like it
Look at all these sparks flyin' (All these, all these)
But I'm still indecisive ('Cause you want me)
And she want me to wife it
But I'm undecided

Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do

Oh, no, I'm undecided

Do-do-do-do-do-do-do, yeah
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
I said I just don't know
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do

Ay 'cause I'm undecided
No, no, baby
I'm afraid of your love
Ooh, you got me baby
'Cause I can't get enough

I'm undecided, excited (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah), ignited (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I don't wanna feel the way I do, but I like it
Look at all these sparks flyin'
But I'm still indecisive
And she want me to wife it
But I'm undecided

Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do

No, no, oh, no, and I want it (I'm undecided)
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do, ayy
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do

No, no, no, no
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Ooh, but I'm undecided

We say life is meant this way but we break
We say we are born this way, so, why change?
Seeping down, deep and down in me
Holding on, 'cause I can hardly breathe
It's darker now, the silence brings me sleep
I'm yearning for a hunger in my dreams, yeah

We are young and we are free
But we don't know how we are meant to be
If we are meant to see
All this trouble in my mind
My heart is searching far and wide, wide

Baby boy running wild
Said my mind is older now
I can't block it out
Baby boy running wild
Said my mind is older now
I can't block it out
Baby boy running wild
Said my mind is older now
I can't block it out

We say life is meant this way but we break
We say we are born this way, so, why change?
Seeping down, deep and down in me
Holding on, 'cause I can hardly breathe
It's darker now, the silence brings me sleep
I'm yearning for a hunger in my dreams, yeah

We are young and we are free
But we don't know how we are meant to be
If we are meant to see
All this trouble in my mind
My heart is searching far and wide, wide

Baby boy running wild
Said my mind is older now
I can't block it out
Baby boy running wild
Said my mind is older now
I can't block it out
Baby boy running wild
Said my mind is older now
I can't block it out

How do you feel?
Is it loneliness?
Is there shining in your heart
But no gloss on your lips?
Do you sail alone?
'Round the island with
The silhouette of a shark beneath the skiff?
And then you say

Wanna be where you are
You're the right one
Wanna be where you are
Cool your heart
Wanna be where you are
You're the right one
The right one
The right one

You've been
Waiting
For the light in me
And there's been waters indeed

We've been
Hanging tight
For all the things we want out of love
So wade, go deep, on these mellow waters too

Wanna be where you are
You're the right one
Wanna be where you are
Cool your heart
Wanna be where you are
You're the right one
The right one
The right one

Wanna be where you are
You're the right one
Wanna be where you are
Cool your heart
Wanna be where you are
You're the right one
The right one
The right one

Though I been trying hard
Not to fall
The feeling is tumbling in
Last night I realized
It's been feeling wrong
To start relying
Making decisions
Based on another person

Cool your heart
Cool your heart
Cool your heart
Cool your heart

Cool your heart
Cool your heart
Cool your heart
Cool your heart

Wanna be where you are
You're the right one
Cool your heart
Wanna be where you are
Cool your heart
Cool your heart
Wanna be where you are
You're the right one
The right one
Cool your heart
The right one
Cool your heart
The right one
---------------------------------------------------
The closer I get to you
The more I feel like crying
The farther I get from you
The more I feel like dying

You said you'll be right here forever, baby
Oh, I know this will be
There's no forever, baby
I'm just looking for a little favour
And you're just trying to save a little time
Baby, let me give you a piece of mine
Forever

That's what I get for loving you
Code blue
That's what I get for loving you
Code blue
And that's what I get for loving you
Code blue
And that's what I get for loving you
Code blue

Take whatever's left of me
If you go without your heart you will never know
You, me
As we walk into those doors
In the shadows of the unknown

I think of you daily
Loving every day about you
And I hope that you
You love everything about me too
But don't you leave me right here
Don't leave me right here, oh, no
Stay with me just a couple minutes more

That's what I get for loving you
Code blue
That's what I get for loving you
Code blue
That's what I get for loving you
Code blue
That's what I get for loving you
Code blue

That's what I get for loving you
That's what I get for loving you
Code blue
That's what I get for loving you
All I do, all I do
Code blue
That's what I get for loving you
Code blue

That's what I get for love
That's what I get for love
That's what I get from you
---------------------------------------------------
Girl, you ain't the only one that's all alone
Hell, I'm only seeing you on the phone
What's a FaceTime? I need face-to-face time
Calls being dropped, you think it's all my fault
I'm in the hills, girl, and I'm working extra hard
Don't let the long distance make a mess of us
Or make you think I'm less involved
I'll call you tomorrow, I'm tired of this


Temperamental love taking over me
All the lows shake my bones every time you leave
But I can't escape the thought of you, boy
But I can't escape the thought
But I can't escape the thought of you


Ya, baby, me neither
I need to breathe you, I never need a breather
I need to see you, and never say "see ya"
I need you now, I'm just as eager
I'll wait around, that's the procedure
I don't ever do it on purpose, girl, believe me
Both get heated, tell me what's the reason
What makes you think for me this is easy?


Temperamental love taking over me
All the lows shake my bones every time you leave
But I can't escape the thought of you boy
But I can't escape the thought
But I can't escape the thought of you

Give me the highs and lows, baby
I'm hung up on it
I'm all alone, I'm all alone
Hopped on a plane with your woes, baby
Do what you want but
I'm waiting up all alone, boy

Temperamental love taking over me
All the lows shake my bones every time you leave
But I can't escape the thought of you, boy
But I can't escape the thought
But I can't escape the thought of you

But I can't escape the thought of you, boy
(But I can't escape the thought of you, boy)
But I can't escape the thought
But I can't escape the thought
---------------------------------------------------
Si ca continue, je me taillerai en or, je mettrai a ma vue
Que des gens qui m'adorent
Que des gens qui m'devorent
Que des gens qui m'evoquent
Un beau mois sans effort
Puis j'inscrirais les rues mon nom en lettre d'or
Pour oublier les fues
Tintant houle dehors
Un peu moins m'as tu vu
N'etait qu'un wesh alors
N'etait qu'un ouais tu sors
N'etait qu'un sombre decor

Oh oh oh, betonne d'ordures
Moi je revais d'ailleurs
Je revais d'etre en sueur sur des scenes si pure
Ces saines lueurs azures pour crier mes peines juste
Pour creer mes renes sur
Et puis parfaire mon allure (mon allure)

J'ai donc concu un plus grand pour oublier le dure
Plus solide que l'feneant, qui est en moi et qui lutte
Qui est en moi et qui est sur de soi
Bien plus de cran que moi deviens un geant tout froid

Je d'viendrais fou ouh ouh ouh de moi
Oh fou ouh ouh ouh comme ca

Si ca continue, je vivrais qu'pour me plaire
Qu'on m'acclame, qu'on me suce
Qu'on l'avale toute entiere, qu'on me dise tout au plus que je n'suis pas qu'un reve, que je suis encore plus
Je deviendrai accro de celui qui donne l'air que tout est bien plus beau quand c'est pas dans ses terres
Quand c'est dans les journaux, car ma vie est plus terne en dehors des reseaux
Et de mes vues j'en ferais des changements d'humeur
Que je compterais par peur de red'venir inconnnu
De retomber dans le plus ou j'n'etais pas grand chose
Ou j'n'etais meme jamais vu
Alors je jouerais a l'etre meme tout le temps ballek
J'nourrirais mon ego de cuillere de paraitre jusqu'a en perdre la peau, jusqu'a m'en perdre dedans, jusqu'a faire couler du sang sur les reflets de mon trop grand

J'te jure je d'viendrais fou ouh ouh ouh de moi
Oh fou ouh ouh ouh comme ca
J't'assure je d'viendrais fou ouh ouh ouh de moi
Oh fou ouh ouh ouh comme ca

Car a tout les quarts d'heure, j'verifie mon contenu
S'il n'a pas par malheur et un peu, par folie, perdu toute sa magie
Perdu tout son meilleur, perdu tout ce que je suis
J'idolerais l'habit que l'on dit "de lumiere", car il prendra ma vie
Et meme dans les crateres je le mettrai quand je crie
Pour ne jamais voir les plies, ne jamais voir mes guerres
Ne jamais voir le gris et a en avoir le tournis

Fou ouh ouh ouh de moi
Oh fou ouh ouh ouh comme ca
J't'assure je d'viendrais fou ouh ouh ouh de moi
Oh fou ouh ouh ouh comme ca
