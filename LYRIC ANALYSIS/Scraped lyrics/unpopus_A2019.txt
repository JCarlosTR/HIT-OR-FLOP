How was I to know?
I was falling like a stone
Into your soul
How was I to know?
I've been by your side
As you strayed from wrong to right
If you've never been told
How was I to know?
All your sins will fade like whispers in the night

You can testify
A thousand times
But you won't change my mind
'Cause there ain't nobody like you
(Nobody like)
No there ain't nobody like you
I won't say goodbye or compromise
No I won't change my mind
'Cause there ain't nobody like you
(Nobody like)
No there ain't nobody
Nobody like you

How was I to know?
That she'd slowly take control
It was so cold
How was I to know?
But I won't criticize
As she strays from wrong to right
If you've never been told
How were you to know?

You can testify
A thousand times
But you won't change my mind
'Cause there ain't nobody like you
(Nobody like)
No there ain't nobody like you
I won't say goodbye or compromise
No I won't change my mind
'Cause there ain't nobody like you
(Nobody like)
No there ain't nobody
Nobody like you

And I know you've gone too wrong
Every time when you came around
And I know nobody's gold
When the thorns we play in ground
So you beg and hold the pain
But we burn to the bitter end
Then we grow from the bitter end

You can testify
A thousand times
But you won't change my mind
'Cause there ain't nobody like you
No there ain't nobody
(Nobody like)
I won't say goodbye or compromise
I won't change my mind
'Cause there ain't nobody like you
(Nobody like)
Ain't nobody like you!

You can testify
A thousand times
But you won't change my mind
'Cause there ain't nobody like you
There ain't nobody like you
I won't say goodbye or compromise
I won't change my mind
'Cause there ain't nobody like you
(Nobody like)
No there ain't nobody like
Nobody like you

Su mama murio, pero dicen que se parecian
Las dos sabian que algun dia alguna llegaria
Tiene tres hermanos, uno esta en prision
Y una hermana que se fue en cuanto tuvo ocasion
Se reian de que su familia fuera pobre
Su papa pelaba cables pa' vender el cobre
Encima, nacio mujer en un mundo de hombres
Pero se juro que iban a conocer su nombre
Consiguio llegar a ser la mas dura del bloque
Compro un kilo a la mitad y lo saco al doble
Nadie sabe como lo hizo, pero se hizo hueco
La vida es un juego y tu solo eres su muneco
Ahora le ha comprao' un piso a su papa
Y no tiene miedo si tiene que hacer... (pum pum)
Dice que pa' la proxima navidad
Va a juntar a su familia como haria su mama

Tu eres duro, tu eres puro
Pero ella es mas
Tu eres loco, tu eres chulo
Pero ella es mas
Ella es mucho mas, mas que tu
Tu eres duro, tu eres puro
Pero ella es mas
Tu eres loco, tu eres chulo
Pero ella es mas
Ella es mucho mas, mas que tu

La pillaron una vez, pero pago la fianza
Y aunque sabe que la siguen, aun tiene confianza
Tiene mucho, pero debe mucho mas
Y tiene que hacer mucho mas si se quiere marchar
La hermana que se fue, ha vuelto con dos hijos
Y unas cuantas deudas, pero no tiene marido
Su padre, como siempre, esta bebido
El hermano que tenia preso, ya ha salido
Y ella tiene que vender si los quiere mantener
La vida es un puto juego y a ella la toca mover
Cuando negocios va a hacer, se que te va a convencer
Porque es una buscavidas y te sabe conmover
Y ella tiene que vender si los quiere mantener
La vida es un puto juego y a ella la toca mover
Cuando negocios va a hacer, se que te va a convencer
Porque es una buscavidas y te sabe conmover

Tu eres duro, tu eres puro
Pero ella es mas
Tu eres loco, tu eres chulo
Pero ella es mas
Ella es mucho mas, mas que tu
Tu eres duro, tu eres puro
Pero ella es mas
Tu eres loco, tu eres chulo
Pero ella es mas
Ella es mucho mas, mas que tu

Thirty totin' and I'm down to blitz
Head first, I hit him in his shit
That ain't my nigga jit, that ain't my fuckin' kid
Free my nigga, let him out the pen
Hard head and I be going in
Fourteen hundred jit and I can't fuckin' switch
Totin' tools, yup, heavy sticks
Kel-Tec with a stupid kick
I be kicking shit like karate kid
Chop him up and watch his body split
I got some young niggas really with the shit
Grew up without a father, bastard child from the Bricks
Left pepper by the door, yeah, we just hit, can't trace the scent
Cracker blitz by six and when I hit need every scent
I'm strikin' pointin' windows, forty hit you like a bitch
I had to wait in line for this, Glock say twenty-six, yeah
Chopper eat your block like some sushi, sleep with fish
Drum with fifty shots and the beam came with the stick
I don't want the bop, man all she for is eatin' dick, ayy, yeah
Come on, all she for is eatin' dick, ayy yeah

I was flying into Chicago at night
Watching the lake turn the sky into blue-green smoke
The sun was setting to the left of the plane
And the cabin was filled with an unearthly glow
In 27-D, I was behind the wing
Watching the landscape roll out like credits on a screen

And I said, "look, look to your left, passengers
Look, look to your right
You can pretend that you're here from outer space
And this, this is your very first sight"

The earth looked like it was lit from within
Like a big manmade electrical ball
As we moved out of the farmlands and into the grid
The plan of a city was all that you saw
And all of these people sitting totally still
As the ground raced beneath them 30,000 feet down

And I said, "look, look to your left, passengers
Look, look to your right
You can pretend that you're here from the fifth century
And this, this is your very first flight"

And I was pretending that I was in a Galaxie 500 video
The stewardess came back and checked on my drink
And I swear that she looked just like Brigitte Bardot
As I had on my walkman, and I had on those eyes
That you get when your circumstance is movie-size

And I said, "look, look to your left, passengers
Look, look to your right
You can pretend that the plane's going to crash in five minutes
And this, this is your very last sight"

"You'd better look, look to your left, passengers
You'd better look, look to your right
Cause I'm going to take this plane out in less than five minutes
And this, this is your very last sight"

(Ay amor.. ¿Donde andas?)

Apenas hace dias
Me estabas dando muchos besos
Me dijiste que
Bonito se siente

Me gusta compartir el tiempo asi te amo
Desde que te conoci
Todo eso me decias
Cuando, cuando me querias

Te fluyo la inspiracion
Y en forma de poema me dijiste
Contigo quiero estar toda la vida

Hagamos pinky promes
Que no terminaran
Que siempre bonito sera..

Nos dimos un abrazo de gorila
Faltaron los aplausos y el confeti
Todo iba super bien
Hasta que entro ese pinche mensajito

De tu ya sabes quien
Tu ya sabes quien..

¿Quien Es?
¿Porque te escribe eso?
¿Quien Es?
¿Porque te manda un beso?

¿Quien Es?
Dime que es una broma
Puedo caer en coma..

¿Quien Es?
Porque no dices nada
¿Quien Es?
Contesta su llamada

¿Quien Es?
Te dije echando madres
Me dijiste no es nadie
Calmate por favor

Pasaron dias
Y no supe nada de ti
Pero un dia un amigo me llamo
Y me dijo esta aqui

Con tu ya sabes quien..

Hicimos pinky promes
Que no iba a terminar
Hicimos pinky promes
Que no se iba a acabar

Me enganaste, me enganaste
Me enganaste
Me enganaste, me enganaste
Me enganaste

Con tu ya sabes quien
Con tu ya sabes quien
Yu ya sabes quien

All these foreigns I don't wanna walk
All this money, shit I gotta spend
You ain't got it but we got it in

Handle dough with my leadership, you never had coke on your fingertips

Your wife told me that she needed dick

Back, back, back, back

Yeah, yeah, yeah
From the back porch, back then
When dreams of a stacked fortune
Black kid with dreams by any means to sees himself foldin' keys to a black Porsche and
That american pie he just want a portion
Product of that environment that he was forced in
Changed course when its out of control
Feel it down in my soul
Fast forward and foresee that fork in the road
Listen
Make sure you on the road, foreign car whippin'
Its mind bendin'
Open your eyes, I'm bendin' the rules
Time's tickin'
The time's different
On a globe, where every soul tryna survive in it
That's the, that's the main concern
Whole hood celebrate when the tables turn, you see
Feels like I'm on the cusp
Great forever, forever's not long enough its just

Back, back, back

Yeah
Wise man once said, "The grind can't stop"
Till letters in your name get bigger like cap locks
Still can't stall, so far from your last stop
Death to the yes-man, blind the mascots
Look past the moment to try to find your last opponent
Tryna find the answer
Before this life flashes past ya
Blink of an eye, go ghost like a phantom
I rather imagine the whole block poppin', corks, toasts, and glasses
More life, no ashes to ashes
Live life fast with no crashes
You can picture that with no caption
Try to see the vision no glasses
You can picture that with no cameras or flashes
You could just imagine
Still keep my hunger like fasting
Still keep it ghetto fab, like putting money in the mattress
And that's just (what), point blank
No biting my tongue, damn he's so frank
And your top 10, they don't rank
They asked me to change some things and no thanks
---------------------------------------------------
(Help me break in, now there is not a black man in this social media...)

2-2-2-2
2

Yeah, do I see a soul or do I see a facade?
Either you hurt a happy king, make up your mind
Laugh now, cry later
On a timeline should I hide in a disguise
From strangers watching my highs or my demise
Laugh now, cry later
Evil remains, world ain't really change, moments of feeling anger Next moment you end up changed
Laugh through the pain, my nigga
It'd be those same celebs seeing the stars struck
Same time see them appropriating the culture
Cry later

I see the whole world changing now, you see my whole world different now
You in the sky, better learn to fly before your spaceship hits the ground
Tell me who should get the crown, you see, this is what you get for now
I see my whole world different now, you see my whole world different now

From raps to movies, to black is beauty
Cop didn't feel the same, felt he had to shoot me
Laugh now, cry later
All fun and games, screaming out gang gang
Until lil homie pull up, put a bullet through a brain
Laugh now, cry later
Let me say this
Some niggas fake woke, like they don't have any flaws
Some niggas too turnt, don't represent any cause
Life's a balance, we live in awe
Lanes, giving her your opinion on her persona
My, do your hair, make-up the way you wanna
Fuck a man's opinion
Some people hoping to peel, some hoping to heal
Talking to a profile, hoping it's real, for real

Us now, we're different now, you see my whole wars different now
You in the sky, better learn to fly before your spaceships hits the ground
Tell me who should get the ground, you see this is what you get for now
I see my whole world different now, you see my whole wars different now

He just said the truth will make us free
Question that we have to ask is do people know the truth
Our condition bears witness they would
That they don't know the truth
---------------------------------------------------

Hulk hogan known to keep the thang smokin'
Steady fuckin' with a blonde I think I'm Frank Ocea-
(DJ Snitch Bitch)
Be still...
I can't deal with all these sudden motions
Mac high as Sierra
Your updates is frozen
Crouching in the bushes
Like I'm jailposing
That 38 special team
I don't need coaching
You are not a man bitch
You're a fucking token
Giuliani suck a dick
That's the fucking slogan
Black market shawty
Keep the thang on me
Blood on my money
But ain't a stain on me
Ridge racer
No games for me
New money new habits
Make you disappear with no trace that's tragic
Riding down Calvert in a caddy with the ratchet
Pussy call the cops so much
The cops should give him badges
Hold up let me hear that back?

Alright!
---------------------------------------------------
Sycophants storm the gate
In vermin-hordes they swarm
Contorted faces gripping torches in the afterglow
First they castigate, then they obfuscate
Truth is the void where reality will end

The foulest walk among us
Janus-faced and starry-eyed
March to the piper's tune
Like rats they'll follow  you just need a song to lead them

Servants fawning, I disavow
This vile calling  I disavow

Who fears the anarchist? Who fears the terrorist?
Truth is the void where reality will end

Fictionaries fabricate
And fascinate the minds of youth
Posturing partisans
Who fuel this nightmare with their solipsistic bullshit

Servants fawning, I disavow
This vile calling  I disavow

Swastikinder, casualties of reasonyour god's a man of straw

Ventriloquists, veritas in absentia
Archetypes of a species yet to come
The die is castno questions ever answered
A downward spiral into vertigo's arms

Who fears the anarchist? Who fears the terrorist?
Truth is the void where reality will end

A dialectic death-waltz
Called 'cards against reality'
A game we each play alone
As gas-lit martyrs for the overlords that feed us

Servants fawning, I disavow
This vile calling  I disavow and repudiate in full

These jackals spit the venom of deception

Sleep walk, no rest for the ignorant
Who cry wolf as they're dragged from the womb
Dry-dox, the pitchfork procession trolls on... and you are next
---------------------------------------------------
Baby, Baby, I just don't know what to do
I fell in love again, but why am I so blue
And darling, darling, it's all because of you
You put a hold on my heart and soul
Leaving me so confused, so confused
Sweet baby, sweet baby, please have mercy on me
I've never loved anyone quite like this before.
First time you, first time me
But I need to know, I need to know
How long you plan on dragging me through
So much pain, so much hurt
It's so hard to stand on two feet
'Cause it's all about what you're doing to me
So why won't you love me like I need to be
You tell me you love me
Then you show me something else,
But I can't blame you 'cause you didn't know how I felt
And I don't know what to do baby, I'm so confused.
And baby, baby, baby
I don't really wanna bother you
Yo gotta make it right and I mean right now
Or I'm puttin' on my walkin' shoes
---------------------------------------------------
You light up when you're in range of the sound of misfortune
Someone shaking the change
String me up like a marionette dancing for you
Do you miss us at all?

You find what drives you and mesmerized you
Leaving us to discover love through...
The fascination isn't fascination unless it motivates you to death

Do you miss you miss us all?
Well never mind it's the same old rhetoric
And if you want to complain
Well would you mind remembering us for a change?

You find what drives and mesmerized you
Leaving us to discover love through...
The fascination isn't
The fascination isn't
The fascination unless
Do you miss us at all?
---------------------------------------------------

Oh you ain't got your flag now, nigga what
No badge no gun you is not tuff
Got the Benilli M4 with the big nuts
Toucan Sam whip it like big bruh, pay homage
You are not a guest, you're a hostage
Rap game thirsty, piss same color as Logic
White boys act tough, I don't give no fucks
Heard he acting like Dex, beat his ass till he Russ

Keep it on the hush
I heard that yo momma, sister, auntie, getting touched
Gat in my lap, catch me surfin stormfront

I put the Judge in seat, I send that bitch to the bing
I heard she pray to Allah, nah bitch you praying to me
I do this shit for Kalief, these coppers begging for war
You niggas marching for peace, I make they family weep
Kill em or give em the beats, we point the gun at your seed
Nigga

And I'm riding in that Bentley coupe bitch
Fuck a Trump and a fucking coon Bitch yea
This is not for no interviews bitch
Or the evening news bitch

Yeee
Yea
Fucking dry
I'm out of weed
I'm irritable
Fuck all my bands, fuck all my friends
I got the weed, I got the stems
Fuck you I'm paid, baby I'm
I got these (Bills!)
I got these (Bills!)
I got these bills!

You overthink-
---------------------------------------------------
You tell me you're sorry
For letting me down
For letting us down
And these politics are taking over
What you're thinking
And what you're saying

So why don't you call me another time
Why don't you tell me what's in your eyes
So why don't you call me another time
2 am doing another line
So why don't you call me another time
Why don't you tell me what's in your eyes
So why don't you call me another time
Why don't you tell me a couple lies

And all these thrills that we're seeking
All this wine we've been drinking
Don't you think we're too old for the faking
Don't you think so darling
Don't you think so darling
Don't you think so darling

So why don't you call me another time
Why don't you tell me what's in your eyes
So why don't you call me another time
2 am doing another line
So why don't you call me another time
Why don't you tell me what's in your eyes
So why don't you call me another time
Why don't you tell me a couple lies

Why don't you take me
Why don't you take me
Why don't you take me, take me, take me
To your side
To your side
Why don't you take me
Why don't you take me
Why don't you take me, take me, take me
To your side
To your side
Why don't you take me
Why don't you take me
To your side, to your side
---------------------------------------------------
A donde quiera que estoy
Me acuerdo de ti
A donde quiera que voy
Te estoy mirando
El viento me trae tu voz
No hay musica que oiga yo
Que no me deje llorando

Que tierra pisando estas
Que estrellas te alumbraran
Tu camino bueno o malo
Que boca borrando esta
Los besos que yo te di
Corazoncito tirano

A donde quiera que estoy
Me acuerdo de ti
Mi alma se muere por ir
Juntito a tu alma
El sol sin luz nunca es sol
El mar sin agua no es mar
Y yo sin ti no soy nada

Que tierra pisando estas
Que estrellas te alumbraran
Tu camino bueno o malo
Que boca borrando esta
Los besos que yo te di
Corazoncito tirano

A donde quiera que voy
Me acuerdo de ti
---------------------------------------------------
Today was not a good day
I forced myself to smile to pretend
But look at you
Can barely say our names
Because of you
We are all estranged

And now you will regret
That you left us here for dead
Now you're praying that we're all ok
And we're praying you'll come back some day

Now look at you
You can't even say our names
Look at you
Confused why you left anyway
So soon you'll regret everything
Look at you
Left us all for dead when you walked away

Before the sun even went down
You said I love you by letting us down

And now you will regret
That you left us here for dead
Now you're praying that we're all ok
You told us when you left
It'd be only for a day
Now you're praying that we're all ok
And we're praying you'll come back some day

But you can't even say our names
Look at you
Confused why you left anyway
So soon you'll regret everything
But soon you'll regret everything
But look at you
You left us all

And I must confess
I could not of loved you less
Confess
You could not have loved us less
Confess
You left us all for dead
You left us all for dead
You left us all

You can't even say our names
Look at you
Confused why you left anyway
So soon you'll regret everything
But soon you'll regret everything
But look at you
You left us all
Now look at you
You left us all

And now you will regret
That you left us here for dead
Now you praying that we're all ok
You told us when you left
It'd be only for a day
Now praying that we're all ok
Now you're praying that we're all ok
---------------------------------------------------
You may not mind that it's over
But I've a different point of view
Even though I am shattered
It's easy for you

You don't have to face the music
You don't have to face the crowd
Just go back where you came from
You ain't even proud

I had a wife and I had children
I threw them all away
And now you tell me, you dare to tell me
I should go back to them
What do you think I should say

I found it hard to leave them
Saddest thing I ever had to do
My problems haven't started
And it's easy for you

I had a wife and I had children
I threw them all away
And now you tell me, you dare to tell me
I should go back to them
What do you think, what on earth do you think I should say

If you ever tire of the good life
Call me in a year or two
I've got no choice, I'll forgive you
'Cause it's easy for you

You only have to call me, it's easy for you
You only have to call me, it's easy for you

Ta choisie la raison, j'ai perdu mon temps
Et moi qui te voyais porter mon nom
On attendais ce moment depuis longtemps
Chacun fait ca vie est-ce que tu m'entends ?
Cupidon ta fleche est mortel
J'suis en +33 dans son tel
Mariage parfait, la vie est belle
Mais dis moi est-ce que tu l'aimes ?
Des fois je me dis j'suis content pour elle
Au fond de moi j'avoue j'ai la haine

Quand j'croise ton mec c'est comme ta mere
Regards zehef, ils font la paires
Ils me questionnent sur ton cas
Je n'suis plus la , je n'suis plus la
Et on s'fait la guerre a cause de lui
Tu n'est pas fiable je te le dis
Tu m'as decu , tu m'as decu
Tu deconnes Samira, Samira
Des fois je me dis j'suis content pour elle
Au fond de moi j'avoue j'ai la haine

I give you that work
Used to break it down
Now I press it up
Turn into the plug
I was out here trappin'
Even with an open case
Fell in love with money
All I needed was a taste
Now I get that work
I don't break it down
I just press it up
Turn into the plug
If you ain't about business
Get up out my way
Take a look at where we came from
And how far we came

I get it from every angle
She do tricks just like Chris Angel
Doin' tricks like acrobatics
Money turned into a savage
I need a chain so big, it made my neck hurt
Diamonds on me, I fell in love with the pressure
Blowin' all your money, just tryna' impress her
Now we countin' hundreds, call her a finesser
Yea, she a freak for a fucking fee
For the right price, she'll get on her knees
For the right price, she'll do any theme
Oh, yeah

I give you that work
Used to break it down
Now I press it up
Turn into the plug
I was out here trappin'
Even with an open case
Fell in love with money
All I needed was a taste
Now I get that work
I don't break it down
I just press it up
Turn into the plug
If you ain't about business
Get up out my way
Take a look at where we came from
And how far we came

If you don't like me, how you like me now?
Paint it all on her face
That ain't no wifey now
She choosin' up
Because I hold it down
Why she always on her rag when you come around?
I never fall and I don't panic
I just pull up for that bag
And once I get it, then I vanish
Pussy to me, only pussy I can get it when I want it
Rollin' up that marijuana, smoke it 'til I'm in a coma, yeah
I'm never coughin' hit it then release
Don't want my love, they just want a piece
And when I'm eating, everybody eats

I give you that work
Used to break it down
Now I press it up
Turnin to the plug
I was out here trappin'
Even with an open case
Fell in love with money
All I needed was a taste
Now I get that work
I don't break it down
I just press it up
Turn into the plug
If you ain't about business
Get up out my way
Take a look at where we came from
And how far we came
---------------------------------------------------
I thought that I've been hurt before
But no one's ever left me quite this sore
Your words cut deeper than a knife
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life

Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
Shaking, falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself
Aching, begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

Just like a moth drawn to a flame
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't sense the pain
Your bitter heart, cold to the touch
Now I'm gonna reap what I sew
I'm left seeing red on my own

Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
Shaking, falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself
Aching, begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

Needle and the thread
Gotta get you out of my head
Needle and the thread
Gonna wind up dead
Needle and the thread
Gotta get you out of my head Get you out of my head

Needle and the thread
Gotta get you out of my head
Needle and the thread
Gonna wind up dead
Needle and the thread
Gotta get you out of my head Get you out of my head

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
Shaking, falling onto my knees (falling on my knees)
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself
Aching, begging you to come help (begging you to come help)
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

You gave me love to enjoy
Like a bright shiny toy to a baby
No matter what you would do
I depended on you like a baby

One thing I know I love you
Yes I loved you like a baby
It was a fool heart you took
And I fell 'cause you look like a baby

To lover's ways I was blind
'Cause I just had a mind like a baby
You're just a flirt
And I had to be hurt just like a baby

I need you so, I need you so

The day I found how you lied
Then I broke down and cried like a baby
Well it was then I could see
You were playing with me like a baby
But you can bet that some day
I'll forget just like a baby

J'pense a mon futur, au mektoub
J'pense a mes potos, j'pense a tout
Lunettes teintees car j'ai les yeux rouges
Lunettes teintees car j'ai les yeux rouges
J'pavane seul-tout, longue est la route
On penave, Samba m'dit "lache rien baise tout"
J'prends sur moi j'dis rien mais je sais tout
Juste j'attend l'bon moment pour en decoudre
T'etais l'sang maintenant j'te vois en che-lou
Fais pas l'fou on sait qu'au fond toi t'es cool
J'ai la touffe papa veut que j'fais la boule
Jappelle ta racli que pour faire la bouffe
Elle est la pour l'rap mais j'm'en bas les couilles
Ses nattes se demelent quand j'lui mets des coups
Quoi qu'il arrive j'me batterai toujours
Un vaillant n'a pas peur d'manger des coups
J'm'en rappelle les mecs quand on retournait tout
Helico, giro, y'en avait partout
Pour revenir au passe moi j'donnerai tout
Pour revenir au passe moi j'donnerai tout


Trafic de me-ca, trafique de me-ar
Du dore, du dore planque dans le placard
Igo tout est noir, j'suis perdu dans l'brouillard
Le Smith & Wesson va trouer tous ces trouillard
Tu veux du produit rentre dans 'laboratoire
Y'a C-max a l'affut et l'guetteur crie ca passe
Pose sur l'terrain j'attend les mapessa
Y'a mon gars Dalsim qui fait des plavant carna'
Toi ca va t'fumer en Clio trois
Trois keume unis d'une kalash comme *****
Dans les che-po pilons couleur ananas
J'ai les yeux rouge mon demon refait surface
Dans le pochtars y'a la frappe de Marc Landers
Dans le pochtars y'a la frappe de Marc Landers
J'vais t'niquer tes morts si tu touches nos p'tites soeurs
C'est Djeffi Ck-Ja maintenant gros c'est mon heure


Toujours des haineux qui veulent pas qu'on avance
J'pense a tout, j'pense a nous, a notre enfance
J't'ai laisse d'l'avance mais quand meme j'te devance
C'est l'travail qui paie, pas la triche ni la chance
La concu' derriere ne suit pas la cadence
C'est Tiako la melo' qui mene bien la danse
Parlons business mais comment on sarrange ?
Six chiffres dans l'c-sa comme ca on s'arrange
J'te fais du sale a la minute (hey)
Pour faire du sale faudrait qu'tu luttes
Le bigo sonne toutes les minutes (yah)
C'est pas la daronne mais ta copine
Elle m'a pris pour un salop (salop)
Donc j'l'ai pris pour une salope (salope)
Comme Pablo j'veux son seille-o
Comme Pablo j'veux son seille-o

Personne te sert la main, meme si tu fais un vux
Regarde moi dans les yeux, dis-moi que cetait faux
T'as fait pleure sa mere, son fils est derriere les barreaux
Il a pris cinq ans ferme, la drogue etait chez toi
C'etait ton pote mais toi tu n'as pas hesite a le lance-ba
On ta passe a tabac, toute ta vie tu regretteras
Ta famille demenagera, c'est la rue c'est la loi

On a connu la rue la vraie
Dieu merci je suis encore en vie
Dis-moi ce que je n'ai pas vu
Des frerots a moi ont perdu la vie

T'adores faire la belle sur Insta et Snap, tu vis pour les reseaux
Tu survis par rapport a tous les mecs que t'as michto
Tu leurs fais la misere, t'as plus de loyaute
Mais comme on dit la roue tourne, la rue va te rattraper
Des mecs t'ont fait un guet-apens
Ils t'ont souleve en peu de temps
Cetait prevu depuis longtemps
T'assumera les consequences maintenant
Tu travailles comme escort a plein temps
T'es sur vivastreet en sous-vetement
Tu connais pas l'pere de ton enfant
T'es sous cocaine, t'as besoin de ta dose
T'as fait une overdose
T'avais juste a te dose
T'as fait une overdose

On a connu la rue la vraie
Dieu merci je suis encore en vie
Dis-moi ce que je n'ai pas vu
Des frerots a moi ont perdu la vie

Selling art to these yuppies
Getting mixed offers
Hold up...

Selling art to these yuppies
Getting mixed offers
I'm In New York like I'm Peter Parker
Wrote a 16 then I tossed it
If I wanted bullshit
I'd just read Gawker (Facts nigga)
Young rick murder
I just shoot walkers
I'm a slave to this rap shit I can't quit (No)
Fresh cig with the grip
A yuppie pop shit
Call the gun Britney jean
When the spears come out
I hit you and JT
You yuppies ain't real
Let you live for a fee
We taking Brooklyn back
You can leave the coffee
And you coons dying to
Word to Charles Barkley (Word)
My head dreaded up like my name mar...
Naw we don't do that
Simple rhyming ass niggas
Get they wig pushed back
Get your mic snatched
Nicotine patched
Call my white boys up
Get your life hacked
Heard your Stock dropped
Nigga this the blow back
Put the Hawkeyes on him
Heard he like M*A*S*H
You gon' rust in peace
Heard you like thrash
Put a price on your head
That's a light bag
45 on me like mike back
Whoa

Hey! Alright!
Baby I'm just heating up
I just wonder is it for you
Feelings stuck
You know how to heat me up
Ice it up
Ice it like a hockey puck
Baby I'm just heating up...
You know how to heat me up...

Deep off in the main...
Hidden hills

I walk in the booth like I own it
I know that I belong there
These days ain't the same
All ain't built like that
These fuck niggas ain't
Like that
Y'all niggas ya'll built like rats ahhh
---------------------------------------------------
I love you, I hate you
I'll kiss you, I'll kill you
I'm toxic and deadly
This chaos controls me

There's no way to fix it
When broken is better
When I'm just a normie
They all just ignore me

I'm salty, she's sweeter
The world needs more like her
The world needs more fighters
Not push over liars

Can we make it better
And stop starting fires?
No stairway to heaven
The way that we're headin

No more regrets
No more regrets
No more regrets
No more regrets

I'm sober, I'm wasted
My peers think I'm crazy
Bipolar and anxious
I'm always impatient

Should I just embrace it?
Prescriptions won't fix this
Don't trust me with fragile
Cuz I'll fuckin break it

Might die at a young age
I know this sounds cliche
I'll dance with the devil
But still count my blessings

Can we make this better?
Or is it just me?
On this highway to hell
And there's no way to tell

No more regrets
No more regrets
No more regrets

This is who I am
Nobody said you had to like it
This is who I am
A modern tragedy

This is who I am
Nobody said you had to like it
This is who I am
A modern tragedy

Bury your mistakes, clear those bones from your closet
With wisdom there's pain, so don't be afraid
No, no, no
No more regrets
(If this life is all we have)
No more regrets, no more regrets

This is who I am
Nobody said you had to like it
This is who I am
A modern tragedy

This is who I am
Nobody said you had to like it
This is who I am
A modern tragedy
---------------------------------------------------
I'm clearly not over you yet


I'm clearly not over you either


Our love has transformed into hate


Damn! Sex right now would sure be great


This is our horny angry tango!


I want to fight!


I want to bang!


This is our horny angry tango!


We're truly furious but...


Dang! We're also horny too!


I want to tear you limb from limb!


And put your limbs all over my limbs!


Each time we fight I crave you more!


This would be better on the floor!


This is our horizontal tango!


We're both pissed off...


And yet turned on!


This is our horizontal, horny, angry tango!
Now it's time for six bar long
Classic tango dance break


Ow, thorns!


Dip!


Whore!


Slap!


I cannot slap you back
Because you are a lady


That clearly is a double standard


But it's probably for the best

This is our horny angry tango!
---------------------------------------------------
I think the party's over
And it's all about to change
Couldn't last forever
Doesn't matter what they say
And all the chandeliers are broken
And the doors are blowing open

This old hall decomposed
And the walls are slowly breaking down to stone
When the vultures come to greet you
They'll be smiling very sweetly
As they pick your bones
We've been sold down the river, now we're never going home

I think the party's over
It's been going on too long
And I can hear some music
I don't recognize the song
And there's nobody left dancing
Cause the floors are caving in

And this old hall decomposed
And the walls are slowly breaking down to stone
When the vultures come to greet you
They'll be smiling very sweetly
As they pick your bones
We've been sold down the river, now we're never going home

And nature takes back what it's owed
And all that remains is overgrown
But life will have its way

One day there'll be another home, I suppose
And the walls will slowly rise up from the stone
When the vultures come to meet you
You'll be smiling very sweetly
'Cause you know
We survived the river, I think we're coming home
---------------------------------------------------
Where to start or where to end it all?
Like a crash with no helmet on
Jeans Helmut Lang
My shirt is Saint Laurent, never wrong
Like bet it all
'Cause I'd be Gucci if that's a Ferragamo
Word to the man in the mirror
I see it all clearer, try not to tear up
I probably drop another one before the year up
Scared to being stuck in Europe
When they say Europe
I lost my grip 'cause my palms was itching
Then I tried to go conscious quick, but I forgot religion
Come on nigga
What we doin' it for?
Rappin' different and acting different out
See that's the talk to your track
I pulled plenty knives out, I got the scars on my back
Bad bitch, wipe me down with the oil and that
Then I pulled a drop-out, like fuck college and that
Where my apology at huh?
I'm on my own time
Galaxy from the goal line
But how I moving, I bet I'd be there in no time
Co-signs coming out of the woodwork like this could work
I came in the game, I got foot first
Still in my favourite hoodshirt
Orange Manhatten, rockin' Tribeca,
know so well
A part of me forgot it, always Copenhagen got me though
Summers I was wildin'
The fact I still got friends left is inspiring
Family and fame mixed, like drinking and driving
Out of control as I'm spiraling and it's tiring
I try to find strength in my environment
Try to stay away from the things that I'm against
My head' getting too big, I'm dodging compliments
The days I'm not with it, they think I'm arrogant
But I don't care I guess
I'm not heartless
But at this point it's "less is more" so its all bless
More or less, if I'm being honest

From the day to night
The night until the light
Just be easy with me
I ain't gon' lie, nah, I'm alright
Just be easy with me
Time fly, my life turned out alright
Just be easy with me
I pray God gon' forgive
I, do not trip, just be easy with me
---------------------------------------------------
Cause you're my angel
I loved you more than everything
Cause you're my angel
I loved you more than everything
Like that, that's why I love you
Why I love you, why I love you like that
Cause you're my angel
Loved you more than everything
Cause you're my angel and I loved you like that
Cause you're my angel
---------------------------------------------------
Well how'd you get to be so sweet
And how'd you get to be so nice
I know that there's a compromise though
So I'll give you your space now

Yeah how'd you get to look so good
'N how'd you get a smile like that
I know that it's time for facts though
So I'll give you your space now

Maybe if my head was in the right place
And if you and I were on the same page
We could find something that is worth keeping
If I wasn't so used to them leaving

Maybe if my glass was always half full
We could sit and drink until it's last call
Maybe I'm just caught up in my dreaming
But it's rare I ever have this feeling

Well how'd you get to be so sweet
And how'd you get to be so nice
I know that there's a compromise though
So I'll give you your space now

Yeah how'd you get to look so good
'N how'd you get a smile like that
I know that it's time for facts though
So I'll give you your space now
---------------------------------------------------
Let's pretend we're seventeen
I think you know what I mean
Baby let's go take a drive
Do the things we used to do on Saturday Nights

'Cause it's all about lovin', all about huggin'
All about holdin' you tight
And it's all about kissin', thinkin' 'bout lovin'
All about lovin' tonight

We'll go park in my old truck
Maybe steam the windows up
Let's go lose all track of time
'Cause if we see the sun come up nobody would mind

'Cause it's all about lovin', all about huggin'
All about holdin' you tight
And it's all about kissin', thinkin' 'bout lovin'
All about lovin' tonight

We got moonlight, we got moonshine
We got the radio, it just feels right
So come on let's go

Yeah it's all about lovin', all about huggin'
All about holdin' you tight
And it's all about kissin', thinkin' 'bout lovin'
All about lovin' tonight

Well it's all about lovin', all about huggin'
All about holdin' you tight
And it's all about kissin', thinkin' 'bout lovin'
All about lovin' tonight
Yes it is

I know these niggas clown

Uh, look
Everywhere I go you know I got that tool on me
Just in case they catch me slippin', tryna pull on me
And I ain't goin' out with that foolery
I'm the type to die before you ever take my jewelry
A lot of homies in the ground 'cause of this gang war
And momma still askin' what I bang for
You know I ride around with that thang on me
In case these suckers ever show up to my front door
They said they want my dead body like a trophy
The brodies said ce safe, you better keep that 40
That's why I try to watch niggas for the phony
'Cause they think this shit a game like a PlayStation Sony
I be out here on my toes I be on alert
Is you really gon' ride if I get murked
Or is you just gon' put a picture of me on a shirt
Tell me is you really gon' ride if I'm in the dirt

Uh, uh, paranoid every time I lay down to sleep
Lookin' out the window
Burner at my reach
So much shit I done seen in these streets
On the East, everybody call Long Beach
I seen a lot of homies deceased lay six feet
A lot of homies got life they be hard to reach
All the homies on the blocc tryna teach
So much beef in this world gotta keep the heat
'Cause the streets get colder and colder
You lookin' over your shoulder
And as the day gets older
This just the life of a soldier
That's how it is when they want war
Show up at your front door
Kids got more guns than a gun store
This the shit we signed up for the way we livin'
They always say we gon' be dead or end up in prison
That's why every night I pray with the K
'Cause I know they can't wait for the day I'm in the grave


I know these niggas clown
So my Glock is never down
Every time I'm in the town
Always keep a tool around

Con firmeza pa delante luchaban dos
generales don Joaquin Guzman el chapo
y Zambada el senor Mayo.

De mi historia
de la mafia presidente
surgieron muchos carteles
pero la guerra siguio.

De la tuna
tambien de Badiraguato
los recuerdos se quedaron
por tierras que camine.

Decisiones efectivas
que cambiaron a mi vida,
con la ayuda de mi gente
pude llegar al poder.

De mi pueblo
tan querido y tan humano
todos juntos como hermanos
logramos permanecer
Mis mujeres
de mis hijos adorados
mis amigos son contados
entre ellos el quinto mes.

Talibanes con rifles y empecherados
equipo especializado
para cuidar al senor,

Con firmeza pa delante luchaban dos
generales don Joaquin Guzman el chapo
y Zambada el senor Mayo.

(Okay!)

You and me
And our bittersweet memories
They never seem to fade away

I've been gone for such a long time
Wouldn't blame you if you left

After all, this world ain't small
But I'll still give you my love
Don't you cry, wonder why
I've given you my trust

I've been gone for such a long time
Wouldn't blame you if you left me
I've been gone for such a long time
Wouldn't blame you if you left

After all, we're bound to fall
So give me all your love

I've been gone for such a long time
Wouldn't blame you if you left me
I've been gone for such a long time
Wouldn't blame you if you left
---------------------------------------------------
If today was not endless highway
If tonight was not endless trail
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time
Then lonesome would mean nothing to me at all

Yes and only if my own true love was waiting
If I could hear her heart softly pounding
Only she was lying by me
Then I'd lie in my bed once again

I can't see my reflection in the water
I can't speak the sounds that show no pain
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
I can't remember the sound of my own name

Yes and only if my own true love was waiting
If I could hear her heart softly pounding
If only she was lying by me
Then I'd lie in my bed once again

There's beauty in the silver singing river
There's beauty in the sunrise in the sky
But none of these and nothing else could match the beauty
That I remember in my true love's eyes

Yes and only if my own true love was waiting
If I could hear her heart softly pounding
If only she was lying by me
Then I'd lie in my bed once again

If today was not an endless highway
If tonight was not endless trail
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time
Then lonesome would mean nothing to me at all

Yes and only if my own true love was waiting
If I could hear her heart softly pounding
If only she was lying by me
Then I'd lie in my bed once again
---------------------------------------------------
Oh, I'm gonna hit you where it hurts because
I know what to say to make it worse
I always get the last word in
Somehow I never seemed to learn it

Closest to me, I always hurt the closest ones to me
Closest to me, I always hurt the closest ones to me

Oh, no no no

I speak before I know what I mean
Talk through my ego not my thinking
Stomp around gonna throw myself a tantrum
Even if it's with the best intention
Don't give me that look that I hate
Like every word I said was a mistake
How'd you really think it would go over
Warming up to my cold shoulder

Closest to me, I always hurt the closest ones to me
Closest to me, I always hurt the closest ones to me

Oh, no no no

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah I know, I know, I know that I
Should apologize (apologize, apologize, apologize)
Oh, but I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Oh god, I'm sorry

Closest to me, I always hurt the closest ones to me
Closest to me, I always hurt the closest ones to me
Closest to me, I always hurt the closest ones to me
Closest to me, I always hurt the closest ones to me

Oh, no no no
---------------------------------------------------
No trippin' up
No losing touch
Just keep your eye on where the deal was
No switchin' lanes
No second take
One false start and you lose your nerve

Say you're with me
Say you're here for the long shot
Been taking calls in the dead of night
I got my own set of complications
No one can hear me right

Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down (bring me down)
I just found love in a cruel town
Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down (bring me down)
I got no time for that other shit now
Ah-oh
Oh-oh-ah-oh
Oh, the other one
Return from checking out
Don't bring me down
Don't bring me d-d-down
Too far gone to be stopping this now

Hit the lobby bell
And help yourself
Guys in here never break a sweat
Little maladroit
No compass point
Taking swings any chance they get

Say you're with me
Say you're here for the long shot
Keep hearing shouts in the dead of night
I've got my own set of complications
Nobody's counting right

Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down (bring me down)
I've just found love in a cruel town
Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down (bring me down)
I got no time for that other shit now
Ah-oh
Oh-oh-ah-oh
Oh, the other one
Return from checking out
Don't bring me down
Don't bring me d-d-down
Too far gone to be stopping this now

Way-faced sickers
Stone boy trippers
Last chance figures
Someone's in a rhythm
Kick it
Riptide rhythms
Half court visions
Quick desicions
Who's in the box seat now?

Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down
I just found love in a cruel town
Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down (bring me down)
I got no time for that other shit
Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down (bring me down)
I just found love in a cruel town
Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down (bring me down)
I got no time for that other shit now
Ah-oh
Oh-oh-ah-oh
Oh, the other one
Return from checking out
Don't bring me down
Don't bring me d-d-down
Too far gone to be stopping this now

I had a vision
I tried to warn them, but they didn't listen
So now they view from the sidelines, watching it all come together
It's time for the intervention, It's time for a new religion
I met the stars but I feel the same, come off the plane and it feel different
To come home and feel distant, I'm trapped in my head but swear I'm still in it
And I'ma stay here, so get used to me
Ain't the same person that I used to be but still humanly, we breathe the same air
Looking at the game like a daycare
The team too strong, they like "Towk, you ain't playing fair"
Watch me just manifest, Frankenstein, make it come to life
Float to the skies like Pegasus, I might burn alive
Won't regret my mistake, trust in the sciences
Gotta feel that heat just to know how hot that fire get
And I'ma keep supplying it, because it's high in demand
I got a hunger that could silence the lambs
And if I fail, bet I try it again
They prolly try and attack, they shoot shots bet I fire 'em back
Like "pop, pop, pop"
Hit 'em like oh my god, pull yo' card
Why you tryna act that hard?
So show some proof, want it, we can go there too
That's not the move, been holding back but now I'm 'bout to let it loose

And if you want it, what you tryna do?
And if you got it, then just show me some proof
I just

And really I'm 'bout to let it loose
I'm 'bout to let it loose
Now I'm 'bout to let it loose
Really I'm 'bout to let it loo-
---------------------------------------------------
I know that you're so afraid, I feel it too
You know I can see the pain inside of you
I know I'm not going anywhere
When the silence hits the air, you'll know it too

I know you never asked for this or ever would
And you carried all the weight alone, you thought you should
Just know I'm not going anywhere
When life's not feeling fair

I wish I could give you an answer
Say the right words and it'd make you feel better
But I'm just me, nothing perfect or special
And I can't make it right today
But I'm here and I'll never fade away

I know back then you played a part for all of them
You know when you're with me you don't have to play pretend
I know you can speak your mind and not get scared
When the silence hits the air, you'll know it too

I wish I could give you an answer
Say the right words and it'd make you feel better
But I'm just me, nothing perfect or special
And I can't make it right today
But I'm here and I'll never fade away

And I hope that you know that I'll always be someone to lean on
And when life gets heavy, I'll carry you through
And I'm hoping that one day it all gets easier
It feels lighter, more beautiful for me

And I hope that you know that I'll always be someone to lean on
And when life gets heavy, I'll carry you through
And I'm hoping that one day it all gets easier
It feels lighter, more beautiful for you
It feels lighter, more beautiful for you

I wish I could give you an answer
Say the right words and it'd make you feel better
But I'm just me, nothing perfect or special
And I can't make it right today
But I'm here and I'll never fade away

Andamos en uno con el ser igual ya andava el patron la perra firme esta dicen los rielteros gracias por la portunidad,

vientate una de trrailero carnalon oro en la vuelta con el paqueton como el sinaloense trai fama de un gallonon

Nichts an dir wertvoll, fick' dein' Sektor
Kommt dir das echt vor; alle sagen nur, was du fuhlst
Du sagst es sind deine Freunde, warum sind sie dann so kuhl
Ich sag zu dir 'Schau Schau', fuhlst du dieses Tape auch
Liebe aus dem Bauch Bauch
Kennst du das eigentlich; wenn ich sterb, wein' nicht
Kerze auf mei'm Grabstein, Seelen bleiben nicht
Schlaf zum letzten Mal ein

You make decisions and do what you want
I'm sitting here steady rolling a blunt
Times that we spend now we ain't even friends
I don't think that it get better than this
Remember I bought you the Lexus
Remember I showed you the best
Remember I spent hella checks
I was buying you bloody shoes
Now you're fucking with that other dude (ahhhh nahhhh)

Girl you changed on me
Girl you changed on me (ohhh nooo)
After all of the shit that we've been through
How you put the blame on me
How you move on so quick
Change ya name on me
Like I ain't the reason you got what you got baby
Like it ain't all me
You changed
You changed
Said you would ride for me
How you switch sides on me
I went the extra mile for you
But you didn't try for me
You changed
You changed
Said you would ride for me
How you switch sides on me
I went the extra mile for you
But you didn't try for me
You changed and I remember

The days you used to love me
And I never thought I'd
See the day that this love would fade away
Girl I gave you my heart and you crossed me
Whatever I had we was splitting that
Back just to make sure we were both saucin
I still speak to your momma quite often
Cause I love your fam like they my fam
And your pops looked me dead in the eye and told me I'm that man
I don't understand why

Girl you changed on me (ohhhh ohhh)
Girl you changed on me
After all of the shit that we been through
How you put he blame on me
How you move on so quick change ya name on me
Like I ain't the reason you got what you baby

What if it only took one more dream
To say what we wanted to say
I see baby, let's have one more too many
And get all those words out the way
Get to the part where we're just past too far
'Cause the bartender just kept on pouring
It might be wrong but it might be right
Guess we'll find out in the morning

Let's do something stupid
Let's do something stupid
If you're thinking what I'm thinking
Then let's get outta here
It's my kinda good bad idea
Let's do something stupid

What if we really did wake up in love
Is that so hard to believe
And what if the thing we always wanted
Turned into what always will be
And what if we never had that last drink
And never wound up in this bed
We'll never make this perfect mistake
It started last night when you said

Let's do something stupid
Let's do something stupid
If you're thinking what I'm thinking
Then let's get outta here
It's my kinda good bad idea
Let's do something stupid

Well baby if it feels good do it
Well maybe we should just get to it
Let's do something stupid
Let's do something stupid

Let's do something stupid
(Let's do something stupid)
Let's do something stupid
(Let's do something stupid)

If you're thinking what I'm thinking
Then let's get outta here
It's my kinda good bad idea
Let's do something stupid
Let's do something stupid
Let's do something stupid

You only wanna hear the good news
You and I never played by the same rules
I took a look inside the pantry
Close enough to know a bagel understands me

More than expected
No plans, happy endings
Get the fuck out my mentions
If you follow my lead

Call me by name
Call me your savior
Fell for the fame
It's alright, it's OK

Call me by name
Call me your savior
Fell for the fame
It's alright, it's OK

I see it through till the weekend
Never making an excuse for a reason
To be different
I gotta tempt it

But I could never expect it
No plans, happy endings
Never walk through my entrance
You can follow my lead

Call me by name
Call me your savior
Fell for the fame
It's alright, it's OK

Call me by name
Call me your savior
Fell for the fame
It's alright, it's OK

Call me by name
Call me by name

Call me by name
Call me your savior
Fell for the fame
It's alright, it's OK

Call me by name
Call me your savior
Fell for the fame
It's alright, it's OK

Walk in your own shoes
Make all your luck alone
So you can look in the mirror and see
Oh, how you've grown

Singing
Why
Would you give your dollar away
Keep it moving every day
So you're bouncing to the rhythm
Why
Don't you give yourself the start
Nothing fumbling about with the blues

Sing it to me

Every day
Every night
I see a darkness
Just embrace it
Tumbling in style

Every day
Every night
I keep it calm here
Being faced by
The noise around
Oh, everything

Tumbling through all these years
Trying to get away from the cold dark fear
Tumbling now scraped and torn
Like a feather in the wind I see you floating on
The whisper in space
Talking 'bout grace
Walking like a ghost I'm done
I'll be a thief in the night
Running fast before your life

Singing
Why
Would you give your dollar away
Keep it moving every day
So you're bouncing to the rhythm
Why
Don't you give yourself the start
Nothing fumbling about with the blues

Sing it to me

Every day
Every night
I see a darkness
Just embrace it
Tumbling in style

Every day
Every night
I keep it calm here
Being faced by
The noise around
Oh, everything

Why can't you ignore everything
You think you're so
Don't mind me, I'm not
today
Take my hand
And walk with me instead
And give me the light
I've mistaken my flows for
And give me the raw aspiration
Stand tall every day
Just to wake up in the morning
With the sun up in my face

So focus on the feeling
Remember that you're breathing
Tell me that you're healing
Don't we know it's a jungle out there

Every day
Every night
I see a darkness
Just embrace it
Tumbling in style

Every day
Every night
I keep it calm here
Being faced by
The noise around

Every day
Every night
I keep it calm here
Being faced by
The noise around

Oh, everything

From January to March I'll tell the world
The icy winds make me cry
From April Fools Day to June I'll tell the world
My tears are rain - Oh, what I lie

I just can't tell the world
I can't tell them that I've lost you
Oh, no I can't
'Cause I can't break the news to myself

Oh, no, no, no
Oh, no, no, no
Oh, no, no, no

From July to September I'll tell the world
The burning sun has me down
From October thru December I'll tell the world
We don't date 'cause I'm snow bound

No, I can't tell the world
I can't tell them that I've lost you
Oh no, I can't
'Cause I can't break the news to myself

No, I can't
No, I can't

Oh, no, no, no
Oh, no, no, no
Oh, no, no, no

---------------------------------------------------
Built myself up, I'm working on it (Yeah-yeah)
Not a day I ain't working
Far away when I'm searching for it, hey-I-yeah
Not a day I ain't searching

You're the only one I wanna talk to
You're the only one I give my heart to
You're the only one I share my thoughts with
Never thought you'd be on some fraud shit
Like, what happened, like, what's hatnin'?
Built myself up, I'm working on it

Counting bread up, like it's hard to lose the dough (lose the dough)
Whip the foreign off the 'lot, life is good, you know (Yeah, yeah)
Try to keep a smile like usual
Thinking too much 'bout I'm losing you
Pop somethin' for me, 'cause you want to (I know you want to)
Do all of the things that I taught you
Still on about you, I won't stop, no (Eh-I-yeh)
I rally sport car through the stop signs
Probably gon' crash, I'm swervin', you know
So I won't ask for your patience or nothing
We spend a bag in an act like it's nothing
Probably shouldn't act on these selfish impulses

Built myself up, I'm working on it (yeah-yeah)
Not a day I ain't working
Far away when I'm searching for it, hey-I-yeah
Not a day I ain't searching

You're the only one I wanna talk to
You're the only one I give my heart to
You're the only one I share my thoughts with
Never thought you'd be on some fraud shit
Like, what happened, like, what's happenin'?
Built myself up, I'm working on it

Change that, your attitude can't be sideways
I step back, got no interest in playing mind games
I remember it all, just so you know
I'll never forget how lights get caught
Hot boy, now I'm boilin' up in gas, like the stove
I take time, gotta take care of the people I got close
And my stars alignin', that's karma
I rarely ever do the hate, no, nah-nah
Probably gon' crash, I'm swervin', you know
So I won't ask for your patience or nothing
We spend a bag in an act like it's nothing
Probably shouldn't act on these selfish impulses

Built myself up, I'm working on it
Not a day I ain't working
Far away when I'm searching for it, hey-I-yeah
Not a day I ain't searching

You're the only one I wanna talk to
You're the only one I give my heart to
You're the only one I share my thoughts with
Never thought you'd be on some fraud shit
Like, what happened, like, what's happenin'?
Built myself up, I'm working on it

Prendiendo, un cigarrito,
Asi es como voy
A pasar el ratito,
Ando, ya bien quietito,
Quiero sentirme
De mas relajadito,
Esto ya no podran evitarlo,
Ya traigo la antorcha calentando...


Bueno, para atizarle,
Ventanas cerradas
Para empezar a rolarle,
Compa, el cigarrito,
Vallalo prendiendo
Pa quedar bien serenito,
Ahora ando rodeado de humareda,
La risita saben que me pega...


Paseme, ese churro,
Yo tambien quiero sentirme
Alla en el otro mundo,
Hongos, alucinantes,
En el bosque me veran
Quemando abajo de un huisache.


Vamos, sacando botes,
Ya ando apalabrando
Unas plebitas pa  la noche,
Se escuchan, las guitarras,
Un buen tololoche
Para empezar a cantarlas,
Para cotorrearlas un buen trago,
Saben que esta noche va pa largo...


Echenle, mas verde,
Saben que relaja
Cuando la lumbre la prenden,
Me pone, mas loco,
Esa sativona
Me puso los ojos rojos,
Forjense uno ya para jalarle,
Son las 4:20 de la tarde...


Saquen, otro gallito,
Que quiero perderme
Mientras me pega el humito,
Ando, bien tranquilito,
Forjenselo compa
Que ya ando relajadito.

J'suis sur l'terrain, j'vois plus les heures qui passent

J'suis sur l'terrain, j'vois plus les heures qui passent

Histoire de maille, quand on pull-up on y va fort
On veut manger ce cash mais les bleus sont a nos trousses

Quand on pull-up on y va fort
Je love le gang jusqu'a la mort
Liberez X
Si t'as pas de flingue reste peace
J'suis sur l'nerco et j'vois meme plus les heures qui passent
J'ai le sac et le flingue sur moi
Big up a mes ennemis
Histoire de maille depose le ceuss' dans le bendo
On veut manger tout cet argent
Dans mon hood c'est la jungle


Ouais j't'avoue que l'odo j'en ai marre
Fuck les hypocrites, un truc a dire, j'le dis en face
Ca bouge pas ouais nos rues sont nefaste
J'briki ta racli, je prend mes clics et je me casse
Coeur noir comme Leonidas

Vas-y casse toi, j'te fais pas fumer sur la cop'
Les seuls pause que les bosseurs on c'est quand les keufs ils veulent filoshe
Et j'sais j't'etonne, j'change de flows et de methodes
Avant elle 'mettait des vues maintenant elle joue a la cochonne
J'suis en showcase dans tout paname et j'en rigole
J'peux passer du rap francais au flow des states sans faire d'effort


J'pull up tous ces negros, tout ca avec maniere (yah)
Fuck toute ces bitches et ceux qui font des manieres (yah)
Grandis dans l'hall, tout les jours je galere (yah)
Pour tout les jaloux 'jette mon majeur en l'air (yah)

You're watching your favorite show
When the TV died
The biggest power-cut in your neighborhood since 1989
A blackout in the center of town
But down in the suburbs where it first went out
They've been asking, asking the question

Are you afraid of the darkness?
Are you afraid of the darkness?
I'm afraid of the darkness too

In the hospital
On the critical ward
Too long a breath between
The break and the backup of her life support
One system failure and it stopped her heart
One power vacuum and we're coming apart
We should be asking, asking the question

Are you afraid of the darkness?
Are you afraid of the darkness?
I'm afraid of the darkness too
We're all caught in the blackout
Trying to feel our way out
Wait for the morning
I'll be waiting for you

Meet me in the middle
Meet me in the middle
Bring a burning candle with you
Meet me in the middle
Meet me in the middle
I will be there waiting for you

I was in my comfort zone
I was singing selfish songs
I'd been taking for granted everyone understood how easy trouble comes
But it's not enough anymore
We can't just turn around and close the door on a world
That's asking uneasy questions
We should be asking ourselves uneasy questions

Are you afraid of the darkness?
Are you afraid of the darkness?
I'm afraid of the darkness too
We're all caught in the blackout
Trying to feel our way out
Wait for the morning
I'll be waiting for you

Meet me in the middle
Meet me in the middle
Bring a burning candle with you
Meet me in the middle
Meet me in the middle
I will be there waiting for you
Meet me in the middle
Meet me in the middle
Bring a burning candle with you
Meet me in the middle
---------------------------------------------------
No he podido sacarme de la cabeza
Eso que sucedio ayer entre nosotros dos
Cierro los ojos y escucho tu voz

Tu solo dime, si quieres que se repita
Ya mi cuerpo siente que te necesita
Solo saca la cita
Pa' demostrarte

Cuanto me gustas
Deja que esta nena se luzca
Que mis movimientos te seduzcan
Si yo estoy pa' ti, tu estas pa' mi

Cua-cuanto me gustas
Deja que esta nena se luzca
Que mis movimientos te seduzcan
Si yo estoy pa' ti, tu estas pa' mi

Tengo la mente en replay
Lo quiero todo para mi, ¿OK?
Con lo que paso ayer
Voy a apodarlo el sensei
No se de donde fue que saco tanto truco (Sencillo)
Con usted no voy a pasarla maluco

Un doctorado en como lo hace una tecnica anormal
Si me permite quisiera volver a probar
El sabor de eso que carga
No le demos a esto mas larga
Tu solo dejame mostrarte

Cuanto me gustas
Deja que esta nena se luzca
Que mis movimientos te seduzcan
Si yo estoy pa' ti, tu estas pa' mi

Cuanto me gustas
Deja que esta nena se luzca
Que mis movimientos te seduzcan
Si yo estoy pa' ti, tu estas pa' mi

Tengo un postre especial que esta esperando por ti
Se que no es tu cumpleanos pero te va a divertir
Saborear la combinacion de mari con chocolate
Pongo la pinata, tu pones el bate, un empate

Es a lo que quiero que lleguemos
Que juguemos aunque poco nos conocemos
Ven que nos vamos a divertir y te vuelvo a repetir

Cuanto me gustas
Deja que esta nena se luzca
Que mis movimientos te seduzcan
Si yo estoy pa' ti, tu estas pa' mi

Cua-cuanto me gustas
Deja que esta nena se luzca
Que mis movimientos te seduzcan
Si yo estoy pa' ti, tu estas pa' mi

No he podido sacarme de la cabeza
Eso que sucedio ayer entre nosotros dos
Cierro los ojos y escucho tu voz

Yo
La Nena Fina
Yo soy Farina
Fleiva
The Commission

(Cuanto me gustas
Deja que esta nena se luzca
Que mis movimientos te seduzcan
Si yo estoy pa' ti, tu estas pa' mi)

So much pressure it makes you sick
Scabs on your skin that you just can't itch
On the back of your tongue with a mouth full of sand
Beg for attention, trace of respect

You've got it all in place
Keeping me away
Now its time to play

Because truth or dare
I can't change the fact that I
Fuels your stare
Is getting closer
Truth or dare
I can't change the fact
That I need you here
So come on over

So much pleasure your body aches
Lips on your skin till it makes your shake
In a room full of crosses where do we begin
Welcome to detention repent for your sins

You've got it all in place
Keeping me away
Now its time to play

Because truth or dare
I can't change the fact that I
Felt your stare
Is getting closer
Truth or dare
I can't change the fact
That I need you here
So come on over

Away your walls they fall
And crumble at your feet
So fall asleep and know that I'll be here
Yeah!

Because truth or dare
I can't change the fact that I
Felt your stare
Is getting closer
Truth or dare
I can't change the fact
That I need you here
So come on over

Go on with her bad intentions

Like, "Brother, I saw her first"
She's got the whole room dancin' in the palm of her hand
Damn, she could break up a band

Alguien te vio salir de ese maldito hotel..

Ooh... I need You
You're the wind that fills, these fragile sails
You carry me, through crashing waves
Ooh... I need You

Breathing, You in
Yahweh, Yahweh
Breathing You in
Yahweh, Yahweh
Breathing, You in
Yahweh, Yahweh
Breathing You in... Yeah

Stars would have no shine, without Your word
So be the spark, Lord let me burn
Ooh... I need You
Ooh... I need You

Burning, within
Yahweh, Yahweh
Burning, within
Yahweh, Yahweh
Burning, within
Yahweh, Yahweh
Burning, within... Oh yeah

You are the great I am, seated upon the throne
Nothing can take Your place in my heart
I'm bringing all I am, standing with lifted hands
Nothing can take Your place in my heart
In my heart

Singing, Your name
Yahweh, Yahweh
Singing, Your name
Yahweh, Yahweh
Singing, Your name
Yahweh, Yahweh
Singing, Your name
...

My dinner's getting cold but your eyes are
(On fire, on fire)
How does everything taste like heaven?
(You're a liar, a liar)
Your drink is warm it's been a while
Sipping on ginger ale and water
I'm running out of re-fills baby
(I'm tired, I'm tired)

We're sitting at the red light and I don't wanna stare
But there's really only one thing on my mind

So kiss me now before I go
You got a chance so won't you take it, take it, take it
You broken boy
Because I feel like this is going well
So why the hell you moving so damn slow?
I know we might not last forever
But if you don't try I guess we'll never know
So kiss me now before I

Cut to the chase I'm over the small talk
(Just shut up, shut up)
Last call is in front of you're running out of luck
(Don't give up, don't give up)
I thought that I had enough of the fakes, and the lust and the weather
But you look like a glimpse of summer

We're walking through the gallery and it all looks the same
But I look over my shoulder Frida Kahlo knows my pain
And all this tension gives me hell
I'm not one to kiss and tell
But the best things there's one thing on my mind

So kiss me now before I go
You got a chance so won't you take it, take it, take it
You broken boy
Because I feel like this is going well
So why the hell you moving so damn slow?
I know we might not last forever
But if you don't try I guess we'll never know
So kiss me now before I

I'm giving you one more chance
I'm giving you one more dance
I'm giving you just another second to see it through
I'm giving you one last look
I bet you think that you're lucky
But honey I'm always on the move
I'm giving you one more chance
I'm giving you one more dance
I'm giving you just another second to see it through
I'm giving you one last look
I bet you think that you're lucky
But honey I'm always on the move

So kiss me now before I go
You got a chance so won't you take it, take it, take it
You broken boy
Because I feel like this is going well
So why the hell you moving so damn slow?
I know we might not last forever
But if you don't try I guess we'll never know
So kiss me now before I

---------------------------------------------------
I got my hands on my face like Macaulay Culkin
Gave her the cig, but I let the smoke in
And it's the same dude
Black pants, brown boots, chest open
I traveled down the road and back again
My girls golden
Black man, white fam
I feel like Jason Jordan
I play my albums front to back and make it feel important
Apply compression when I spit so it don't get distorted
Piper Chap
With the strap
Fuck the talk
Get the warden
I think I'm Rick and Morty
In the lab I take precaution
Snipe 'em out
Burn the body
Stash the Glock
Buy the coffin (Nasty)
Just for me
Yo style is my custody
Man I should charge a shipping fee
These rappers don't mean shit to me
2 guns, Mulder and Scully, I'm solving mysteries
Feminist, pistol whip your wife first, that's chivalry
Sounding like my minimes
But you ain't got the heart to do these evil deeds
Debra pack
Turn Stone Cold into Simple Steve
Where it at
Slap a nigga up
Then I get the cream
5 buck, 6 cookies
Sounding like a deal to me
Yo shit don't appeal to me
My fans going heel for me
Gots to keep it real for me
Shouldn't even be on no bills with me
These punk niggas be killing me
That wack shit ain't trill to me
Fuck y'all niggas, I take the heat
Don shit
---------------------------------------------------
You know I'm right for the summer babe

---------------------------------------------------
Yeah he's over you
He's lost his point of view
He's stuck on Hollywood
It's not your fault
And it's easy, too
He's good at teasing you
With how his fingers move
It's all a crime
It's just his sign

No, I don't need one more reason not to chose ya
'Cause I came in lookin' for my hallelujah
No, I run these demons off my back
But your walls and edges start to show the truth
I see right through
Two, three, four

It's all a lie
Dressed up in overdrive
Choose your own paradise
It's up to you
And it's easy, too
You know just what to do

No, I don't need one more reason not to chose ya
'Cause I came in lookin' for my hallelujah
No, I run these demons off my back
But your walls and edges start to show the truth
I see right through

As the arrow slips inside of me
It's all another wasted dream
Alone, alone
As the arrow slips inside of me
It's all another wasted dream
Alone, alone

No, I don't need one more reason not to chose ya
'Cause I came in lookin' for my hallelujah
No, I run these demons off my back
But your walls and edges start to show the truth
I see right through

Wrappin' the East in the same way
She got that vibration, that energy
She knows she got me feelin' some type of way

Sad story, might find it boring
Lost his mum to a drug named heroin
Father's gone, so grandma's left with everything
Two grandkids and a daughter's coffin
I never really knew him when he was growin' up
But I assumed that it was a little fucked
No parents for him to look up to
Just a brother whom I know was a dodgy fuck

Later on, second school and
You would probably call us friends, but
A more appropriate word is a social acquaintance
'Cause if I'm honest I never really gave a shit

I used to think he was a dick
He tried to hard to fit
And never grew out of it

Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably givin' up, givin' up
I think he's had enough, had enough
'Cause he ran out of luck, out of luck

Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably givin' up, givin' up
I think he's had enough, had enough
'Cause he ran out of luck, out of luck

Never left his hometown
That's what probably did it
Never saw the other worlds
So he didn't want to go and get it
Occupied by fitting in where minds
Are small west, small things
Make these small kings feel so tall

Will he ever change?
Well apparently
He reapplied for college and was waiting for his grades
Would that help his case?
Oh, I couldn't ever say

Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably given up, given up
I think he's had enough, had enough
'Cause he ran out of luck, out of luck

Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably given up, given up
I think he's had enough, had enough
'Cause he ran out of luck, out of luck

But wait my light's out, a night out
Brothers in town, some doubt, a few fights now
Now kicked out clubs, shit the sun's up
One look's all it took for his girl to cuss at another

Dudes being dudes
They blow at the chest to impress these breasts
That'd just started this mess
They must protect the damsel in distress
So other girl's man decides to clench his fists

And then he threw and missed
Brother's hit, as did his
Dropped him quick, then one kick to the head
Oh shit, other man is dead

Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably given up, given up
I think he's had enough, had enough
'Cause he ran out of luck, out of luck

Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably given up, given up
I think he's had enough, had enough
'Cause he ran out of luck, out of luck

And now he's locked away
Twenty-one years of age
How many lives must go to waste?
As far as graves
Until I see some fucking change
And I don't even know how
We continue to
Fight one another now

Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably given up, given up
I think he's had enough, had enough
'Cause he ran out of luck, out of luck

Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably given up, given up
I think he's had enough, had enough
'Cause he ran out of luck, out of luck

Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably given up, given up
I think he's had enough, had enough
'Cause he ran out of luck, out of luck

Life is so precious, well
Sometimes I forget, but hell
When I see death

Una bolsa de perico
Dos ochos de mota es lo que lo distinguen
Un Afro largo cuidado
Cabello rizado y ojos colorados

El corrido que yo canto no es para un mafioso
Es para un marihuano
Master Kush su favorita
Pistear bukanitas y un cuadro lavado

Blontes y bongs y una pipa un papel de tortilla
Tambien a rolado
Andar arriba es su estilo
Lo que le fascina es andar marihuano

Desde que tenia quince anos se subio a un avion
Y aun no se ha bajado
Andar arriba es su estilo
Nunca lo confundan le dicen El Afro

Indica, cronics, sativa
No se da de grande el estres le ha pegado
Master kush pa' andar al tiro
Si ya anda cansado un toque de la hide

Un toque con mis hermanos
La rata el rabano chuyito graduado
Andar con todos contentos
Seguimos quemando esto no es un pecado

(Seguimos avanzado.. Esto es Legado 7)

No me critiques mi vida
Solo porque miras mis ojos cerrados
Aqui tienes un amigo
Si quieres un toque aqui traigo y quemamos

No me fijo en pequeneces yo sigo mi vida
Fumando y loqueando
Sacando humo como tren
No me la compra nadie nosotros sembramos

Ya me voy ya me despido ya ando marihuano
Ya no se lo que hablo
Chisto ya viene llegando trae Kush en su mano
Mejor nos quedamos

No soy mafioso ni grande no me ando escondiendo
Donde quiera ahi ando
Y dijo al borrego
Los fans que yo tengo me llaman El Afro
---------------------------------------------------
Je t'ecris
C'est moi
Il est tot encore
J'ai reve si fort

Le papier
Sous mes doigts
Est dur comme ton corps
Je sais, j'ai tort, j'ai tort

J'ai dessine
Ton nom et ton adresse
La, sur le cote
Ca fait comme une promesse

Dieu, qu'elle est banale
La petite carte postale
Qui fait du mal

J'ai choisi
Cette image
Je la trouve jolie
Peut-etre un peu sage

A vrai dire
Sans rougir
J'n'ai rien a te dire
Je veux juste t'ecrire, t'ecrire

J'ai dessine
Ton nom et ton adresse
La, sur le cote
Ca fait comme une promesse

Dieu, qu'elle est banale
La petite carte postale
Qui fait du mal

J'aimerais te parler
Du sable adorable
Du vent qui dort
Sur les coquillages d'or

J'aimerais te parler
Des gens dehors
Qui bronzent ensemble
Comme des coquillages morts

Mais la, sur mes lignes
J'suis pas bien maligne
J'suis qu'un semaphore
Qui crie "j't'adore, j't'adore"

Je t'ecris
C'est moi
Oh, c'est dur encore
Je t'aimais si fort

Le papier
Sous mes doigts
Encore et encore
Je sais, j'ai tort, j'ai tort
Je sais, j'ai tort, j'ai tort
Je sais, j'ai tort, j'ai tort

Harmonizing
---------------------------------------------------
Same old pathways we are walking
Nothing's ever changed at all
World is only shifting color
Day by day, we rise and fall
Building up and breaking down
Time of peace and war
Cast away and gathering
Until we reach that shore

All you prophets, all you scholars
Waiting for the day to come
Science, progress, we can't stop
The run of things, we'll all be gone
The more we try to find, the less we see
We'll fly to Venus
We can accelerate the pace of change
But who will redeem us?

All we are
Is an ardent fire
And we rise and fall
Our life's desire
All we are
As long as we live
As long as we give
As long as we try to rise

Look up (Gain light)
Why not? (It's your life)
It's my faith (It's your time)
It's my faith (in you)
We will follow our ancestors
On the way to kingdom come

All we are
Is an ardent fire
And we rise and fall
Our life's desire
All we are
As long as we live
As long as we give
As long as we try to rise

All we are
Is an ardent fire
And we rise and fall
Our life's desire
All we are
As long as we live
As long as we give
As long as we try to rise
---------------------------------------------------
I don't know where I'm going
Don't know where I came from
I don't know if that's the sun or the shining of a hand gun
I don't if racing down the road I'm taking is leading to a cliff
Or a subway station
I might need a doctor might need to be a patient
All I'm saying

Only thing for certain
Is there ain't no sure thing
No one knows what lurking
Well back behind that curtain
No, no, no there ain't no way of knowing
Everyday, everyday, everyday
Is a leap of faith

Shot from a shot glass bottle or a cannon
I gotta hold on tight just might feel abandoned
Rich man, poor man
Any man, woe man
My man, your man
Beating down the door man
Waking on the floor at four in the morning
But take it as I want it

Only thing for certain
Is there ain't no sure thing
No one knows what lurking
Well back behind that curtain
No, no, no there ain't no way of knowing
Everyday, everyday, everyday
Is a leap of faith

I don't know where I'm going
Don't know where I came from
Might shave my head set it on like a kingdom

Only thing for certain
Is there ain't no sure thing
No one knows what lurking
Well behind that curtain
No, no, no there ain't no way of knowing
Everyday, everyday, everyday
Is a leap of faith

Dead flies on the beat so I told Teezy to turn it off

But they're takin' what I'm makin', yeah, they're robbin' this boy blind

Keep your ragged hotel, son, I'm takin' my ass home
Mama needs some lovin', and Daddy's been gone too long

Savin' up that honey, Daddy loves that honeycomb
Mama needs some lovin', and Daddy's been gone too long

Well, we don't get no sugar while I'm out here on the road
These outlaw bands and all my fans, I'm pourin' out my soul
Livin' like some gypsy child, that's the life I choose
For heaven's sakes, I just can't wait, I'm glad this run is through

I'm blowin' up my Chevy, Daddy's gonna drive it home
Mama needs some lovin', and Daddy's been gone too long
(Aw, yeah)

Savin' up that honey, Daddy loves that honeycomb

Savin' up that honey, Daddy loves that honeycomb
Mama needs some lovin', and Daddy's been gone too long

Tired of being away, tryna stay awake
When I think that you will always know
That's where you go
It's just where you and I go

Try to write this song in another town
In the backseat of this train
You say that I'm insane
Maybe I am and I don't know

Yeah I'm gonna let it burn
'Cause I'm gonna let it burn
Yeah I'm gonna let it burn
All my days, good things don't come
To those who wait
Yeah I'm gonna let it burn

Tired of being away, tryna stay awake
When I think that you will always know
That's where we go
It's just where you and I go

So when you're worried that you're burning out
And your friends don't know what you're talking 'bout
You say your candle's gonna burn out

Yeah I'm gonna let it burn
'Cause I'm gonna let it burn
Yeah I'm gonna let it burn
All my days, good things don't come
To those who wait
Yeah I'm gonna let it burn

When my head was down my mama told me
To take some time to get out in the rain
And as I blamed it all, no caution to the wind
Blowing hard to keep this happening

'Cause I'm gonna let it burn
Yeah I'm gonna let it burn
All my days, good things don't come
To those who wait
Yeah I'm gonna let it burn

Big on the night
I'm totally big on the night
It's a complex destination
Because it ends in resurrection
I'm so sorry that there's nothing there, but it's sung in the light
Two time winners would've been alone
Gonna cry
Every day

Dudes who rain on innocence
It's around time time fools done pay their respects
And your heart, never brighter than light

Episode!
Show me another one

And it's gonna gotta turn into a baby
And it's gonna gotta why? because to save me
In a tunnel of love

I had the play
Peace with me

I would attest
Peace with me
I would attack
Peace with me

Big on the night
I only go with the night
To daunt the play's donation
And await the resurrection
It's so silly that there's nothing there, but it's sung in the light
Two time winners would've been alone
Gonna cry
Every day

Two times there and no recess
It's around time time school time play on this mess
And your heart, in the manner of now

Episode!
Show me another one
---------------------------------------------------
Got one that'll take you anywhere you wanna go
You got one for your face within your Instagram post
Email and Gmail ain't what I need
My baby walked out and now I'm down on my knees

Can you help me get her back?
You got an app for that?
If you did, with one finger, I could just a-bring her
Home and it would be OK
She would be right here, fetchin' me cold beer
Instead, she's out with ol' what's-his-name
I'd be livin' large, if my phone was charged, and my wallet would still be fat
Mr. High-Tech-Cell-Phone-Man, you got an app for that?

She don't care if I pull out my hair
That judge didn't cut me no slack
Mr. High-Tech-Cell-Phone-Man, you got an app for that?

Can you help me get her back?
You got an app for that?
If you did, with one finger, I could just a-bring her
Home and it would be OK
She would be right here, fetchin' me cold beer
Instead, she's out with ol' what's-his-name
I'd be livin' large, if my phone was charged, my wallet would still be fat
Mr. High-Tech-Cell-Phone-Man, you got an app for that?

Take a seat
Right over there, sat on the stairs
Stay or leave
The cabinets are bare and I'm unaware
Of just how we got into this mess
Got so aggressive
I know we meant all good intentions

So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close
Why don't you come on over
I just can't let you go

Oh, baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle
In the middle

Oh, take a step
Back for a minute, into the kitchen
Floors are wet
And taps are still running, dishes are broken
How did we get into this mess
Got so aggressive
I know we meant all good intentions

Pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close
Why don't you come on over
I just can't let you go

Oh, baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle
In the middle

Oh, looking at you I can't lie
Just pouring out admission
Regardless my objection
And, and it's not about my pride
I need you on my skin just
Come over, pull me in just

Oh, baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle
In the middle, no no

Baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle, oh
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle
Middle
In the middle

Oh-ohhh
In the middle
In the middle

Oh-ohhh
In the middle
In the middle

Oh-ohhh

In the middle

An old man turned ninety-eight
He won the lottery and died the next day
It's a black fly in your Chardonnay
It's a death row pardon two minutes too late
And isn't it ironic... don't you think

It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's the good advice that you just didn't take
And who would've thought... it figures

Mr. Play It Safe was afraid to fly
He packed his suitcase and kissed his kids goodbye
He waited his whole damn life to take that flight
And as the plane crashed down he thought
"Well isn't this nice..."
And isn't it ironic... don't you think

It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's the good advice that you just didn't take
And who would've thought... it figures

Well life has a funny way of sneaking up on you
When you think everything's okay and everything's going right
And life has a funny way of helping you out
When you think everything's gone wrong and everything blows up in your face

A traffic jam when you're already late
A no-smoking sign on your cigarette break
It's like ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife
It's meeting the man of my dreams
And then meeting his beautiful wife
And isn't it ironic... don't you think
A little too ironic... and, yeah, I really do think...

It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's the good advice that you just didn't take
And who would've thought... it figures

Well life has a funny way of helping you out
When you think everything's gone wrong and everything blows up in your face

---------------------------------------------------
I'm frustrated, I think I hate this
I can't even look interested
I think that the older I get, the harder it gets
Maybe I'm fine, maybe I'm dying
Oh, I'm just tired, tired of trying
To hold a conversation together
That means nothing at all

Small talks, small talks
We don't talk enough
Small talks too much
Somebody get me out of here

Are we friends, did I miss it?
Because you're talking at me like we're connected
Why should we pick it up, we never left it?
I'm too passive aggressive
Maybe it's mean, maybe it's bitter
And I don't wanna go down as a conversation quitter
But I just can't do it

Small talks, small talks
We don't talk enough
Small talks too much
Somebody get me out of here
Small talks, small talks
We don't talk enough
Small talks too much
Somebody get me out of here

I used to go out and talk to everyone I'd see
But now when I go out, it's just keeping me from my sleep
I used to go out and talk to everyone I'd see
But now when I go out, it's just keeping me from sleep

I don't wanna be rude
I don't wanna be rude
I don't wanna be rude
But I don't wanna just

Small talks, small talks
We don't talk enough
Small talks too much
Somebody get me out of here
Small talks, small talks
We don't talk enough
Small talks too much
Somebody get me out of here

Amor Si Te Dicen
Que todo marcha perfecto sin ti
Puedes reirte
Y decir que son mentiras

Porque si
Es asi
Solo miento..

Amor Si Te Dicen
Que ando con alguien y la quiero de verdad
Y si lo dudas
Dilo en voz alta

Que eso nunca pasara..

Que no me dare jamas
Otra oportunidad..

Si Te Dicen que
Ya te olvide
Puedes estar segura que jamas
Lo hare

Porque nadie me conoce como tu
Y a ti no te pueden enganar mis ojos..

Si Te Dicen
Que puedo vivir
Tu les dices
Que puedo morir

Si no te arrepientes
Y regresas pronto
Va a ser imposible
Que vuelva a empezar

Sin ti
Sin ti
Que vuelva a empezar..

Si Te Dicen que
Ya te olvide
Puedes estar segura que jamas
Lo hare

Porque nadie me conoce como tu
Y a ti no te pueden enganar mis ojos..

Si Te Dicen
Que puedo vivir
Tu les dices
Que puedo morir

Si no te arrepientes
Y regresas pronto
Va a ser imposible
Que vuelva a empezar

Sin ti
Sin ti
Que vuelva a empezar

"Eh, eh negro, tu m'entends ou pas ?
T'es dans ta putain de Wati bulle ou quoi ?
C'est bien a toi que j'cause negro
J'entends qu'des rumeurs sur vous !
C'est quoi cette putain d'histoire Tiako ?
Y'avait sept putains de negros qui venaient de signer chez Wati B
Et maintenant il n'en reste que trois
C'est quoi ce merdier ?
J'pige que dalle a vos histoires, tu vas m'expliquer tout ca bordel"


On avait signe a sept mon lossa
Est-ce que tu t'en rappelles de ca ?
Est-ce que t'en as parle de ca ?
Dans lnos contrat y'a vos grosses initiales
J'vais pas tout raconter car cette histoire est sale
J'vais faire un debriefing en balle
On n'a pas fait les traitres, on n'a ni fait du mal
On passe pour les mechants et j'trouve pas ca normal
Chez Wati B on avait tous signe nous sept
Reflechissez pourquoi il ne reste que nous trois
Maintenant je me demande qui a retourne sa veste
En arriver la nous memes on n'en voulait pas
Le succes monte au crane
J'ai toujours ete droit
On est toujours les memes
On n'a pas signe de pacte
A se-lai y'a pas de blemes-pro
C'est capuche qu'on est la night gros
Bouge la te-te sur le tempo
C'est la trixma ou Tiako La Melo'
Casse ta puce si t'es sur ecoute
Je vais pas aller loin si je t'ecoute
On sait que c'est nous que tu redoutes
Bre-som meme au mois d'aout


"Ah j'comprend mieux negro
Toutes ces histoires c'est vraiment triste quand meme
J'ai du mal a comprendre comment un putain de ramassis de conneries vous en a fait arriver la
Et toi t'as un mot a dire Djeffi ?"


J'suis pose dans ma bulle comme un somnambule
Les faux freres, les putes, c'est ce qui vous encule
J'ai pas de vecu mais j'ai fait des thunes
T'as rien fait pour le tieks, t'as sauve ton cul
Devant ma gueule, tu veux jouer les durs
Quand tetais dans le bat', t'avais des lacunes
J'suis toujours au banc, et j'peux pas l'quitter
Gros on etait sept, et chez Wati B
J'suis fatigue et j'suis degoute
T'as rien dune secu', ca t'a marche d'ssus
Jetais la pour toi, mais pas ton jumeau
Couteau dans mon dos, la je fais mes abdos
T'es un rigolo, tu parles de la ligne mais tetais banni
J'ai une grande famille, pas de trafiquants
La j'suis pas content
C'est une perte de temps, rafale dans tes dents


"Djeffi c'est pour ca que je t'ai toujours kiffe enfoire
J'commence a piger tout ce qui s'est trame dans votre putain de dos
Y'a trop de negros qui jactent sans savoir
Je pense que y'a encore un mec qui peut nous aider a mettre au clair toute cette putain d'histoire
Dis-leur Bne"


Le mal y est, j'ai rien quitte
Parle pas si tu parles pas monnaie
Qu'est-ce 'tu racontes ? J'suis au quartier moi
(Qu'est-ce 'tu racontes ? J'suis au quartier moi)
Si j'pouvais revenir au passe, j'serais revenu a l'epoque du carre
Si t'en parles dit la verite, boy
(Si t'en parles dit la verite, boy)
J'suis dans le binks et non j'ai pas perce, et non j'suis pas partie, c'est reel
Les grands m'ont averti, les grands me l'avaient predit, au phone-tel
"Tu cries, pourquoi tu cries ?
Attends j't'envoie les p'tits"
Comme un dwell, ils parlent de nous comme si, on les avait trahis


C'est pas la cite qui font les bonhommes
Mais c'est les bonhommes qui font la tess'
La rue c'est pas ta mere, la rue c'est pas ton pere
Elle t'a attire que des problemes
Que des faux freres, que des faux freres
Dans le brouillard ou j'suis du-per
J'en roule un autre, j'en roule un autre
Tous ca pour apaiser ma haine


"Ok les gars, c'est fini tous ca faut passer a autre chose maintenant
Ca sert a rien de repondre a toutes ces merdes
C'qu'on veut nous, c'est que vous nous envoyez de la putain de patate dans nos oreilles
Faites nous peter tous ca bordel de merde
Fini toutes ces histoires, maintenant faut laisser parler la musique
Alors rendez-vous le 16 mars bande d'enfoires d'negros"

Driving in my beat up car
Too broke to go very far
Some days I just wanna feel ya
Other days I wanna kill ya
Higher than no other love
Safer than no other drug
If you wanna tell me something
Call me, call me, call me, call me

It all takes time
You don't take time
Everything takes time
It takes time to learn

Yeah, yeah yeah
Call me up again
Yeah, yeah yeah
Call me up again

Thinking on the things I lost
Wrote it down but I still forgot
All the shit I swore I'd remember
Everyone's getting back together
And I wish I could but I just left town
I'll hit you up when I'm back around
You bring me higher than no other love
Safer than no other drug
If you wanna tell me something
Call me, call me, call me, call me

It all takes time
You don't take time
Everything takes time
It takes time to learn

Well, hello my lonely roller coaster
I'm comin' up so please scoot over
Call my sister, call my mom
Call my girlfriend, call the cops
Shut off the world I can't let go
All the shit I think I know
When I am right but I am wrong
You have loved me all along
When I am right but I am wrong
You have loved me all along

Driving in my beat up car
Too broke to go very far
Some days I just wanna feel ya
Other days I wanna kill ya
Higher than no other love
Safer than no other drug
If you wanna tell me something
Call me, call me, call me, call me
---------------------------------------------------
Most when it's almost like a bane
You arrive like a siren refrain
Like death, she takes everything
And dazes me like patent medicine
Into this strange divine
The road was serpentine
A network of silken threads
Spider's trapping web
Makes me rue the day

You became my pain killer
I rue the day
Alright, alright, alright

Praying at the altar of your legs and feet
Your saliva is a drug so bittersweet
I'll arrogate what's there to take
In an evanescent embrace
Anesthetic liaison
Honey honey you're my medication
Like love, you take everything
And this static yearn
Makes me rue the day

You became my pain killer
I rue the day
Alright, alright, alright

Strange divine
Strange divine
Strange divine

I rue the day
You became my pain killer
I rue the day
Alright, alright, alright
I rue the day
You became my pain killer
I rue the day
Alright, alright, alright
You became my pain killer
You became my pain killer
---------------------------------------------------
I've been riding around Saturn's rings
Learning how each one sings
Jumping from star to star
Finding my own heart

I've been learning to slow down
Putting roots in that ground
Waiting until that fruit is ripe
Growing up in that light

Sunshine through my window
She's coming home tomorrow
It's my choice to be joyful
Giving up all sorrow

This is my story
This is my vision
Everything right on time

Well I'm hearing Jupiter's Call
Got me feeling strong and tall
Laughing at the play of life
Giving me a brand new sight

The war between right and wrong
I'm putting it all in song
And trust that I do my best
Letting my body rest

Sunshine through my window
She's coming home tomorrow
It's my choice to be joyful
Giving up all sorrow

This is my story
This is my vision
Everything right on time

Sunshine through my window
She's coming home tomorrow
It's my choice to be joyful
Giving up all sorrow

This is my story
This is my vision
Everything right on time

On est des freres, mais c'est chacun son cartel
Tu veux nous approcher, tu vas tres vite t'ecarter
Ils veulent la guerre ? Y'a pas d'soucis on va s'les faires
On va s'les faire, tu crois qu'on va s'laisser faire ?
Plusieurs produits dans le barrio
Plusieurs lle-ba dans le barillet
Faut des pesos, faut des dineros
Pour etre comme nous il faut charbonner


IbraK s'te plait, calme toi
Dans mon cartel ca bicrave du taga
Du 0.8 ton cheua
Les chargeurs sont bien charges si y'a drah
Hero', cocaina
Calibre dans le fion m'a dit Mufasa
Si les bleus descendent, mes gata
C'est en 4-3-3 qu'on fait du le-sa


J'suis pose sur mon ter-ter, j'ramene la frappe de l'ancien
Cinq freres, cinq glocks, si tu fais le malsain
Pyromane de naissance, et j'fuck toute ta descendance
Frerot jusqu'a la mort, pour vous j'peux trouer des corps
En cas d'bourbier, toujours arme
Pour la famille, toujours soude
Ton quartier on va l'retourner
Prendre ton terrain et l'pietiner
Tu m'fais pitier, rempli d'cine, canon scie
Immunise, trop protege sous calumet
J'suis trop pete


On est des freres, mais c'est chacun son cartel
Tu veux nous approcher, tu vas tres vite t'ecarter
Ils veulent la guerre ? Y'a pas d'soucis on va s'les faires
On va s'les faire, tu crois qu'on va s'laisser faire ?
Plusieurs produits dans le barrio

Faut des pesos, faut des dineros

Gang !
Que des trafiquants, que des trafiquantes
T'es en manque de quoi ? On va t'alimenter
Vous faites pas de benef', vous vous la racontez
J'blesse, j'recupere (hey), comme N'Golo Kante
Un peu d'pesos, et j'me barre de la
Crible de balles tu seras si tu parles mon gars
C'est la tempete qu'on met quand y'a la policia
Devant l'arme russe, faut pas parler chinois


Implique dans ce genre de chose
Nous on pense a fond, jamais de pause
Donc c'est rien, on te fait la peau
Parlons pas business si toi meme t'es pauvre
Ton rain-te tourne pas t'es un tho-my
Ca sert a rien qu'tu joue les Tony
A mon avis, c'est mieux tu vas t'chercher un job oui
J'voudrais avoir le benef' et la copine a Pablo
Ton rain-te il tourne pas, ca fait des chromes, ah ouais c'est chaud
J'voudrais avoir le benef' et la copine a Pablo
Ton rain-te il tourne pas, ca fait des chromes, ah ouais c'est chaud

Lumbrecita quiero de corridos
Esta noche musiquita en vivo
Luisito pasame ya el toquisito
La chamba ya estuvo en un ratito
Vamos a contar los billetitos
Pa pegarnos un relax, nomas poquito

Vacaciones voy pa SanLuisito
Jalar la bandona ir a pasear
El negocio no es nada mas Chambear
Tambien se trata de disfrutar
Los verdes se hicieron pa gastar
Y la "Master Kush" para quemar

Lo que muevo no voy a contar
Soy feliz ando de aqui pa ya
Saludos tambien pa mi carnal
Y ya esta apunto de activar
El Chore libre y viene con todo
Hacer billetes como en los tiempos de oro

(Asi nomas Carnal Danny y que se Jalese la Tubona Carnal Eduar... Y pura hermandad, pues si, no)

Del 18 me gusta tomar
Tengo variedad para rolar
En un clup nos vamos a enfiestar
Los billetes vamos a soltar
Un traguito leve pa bajar
Saludos Luisito nomas ahi nomas

Compa Jimmy sigue reforzando
Cuidando Sonora que es su casa
Varias oficinas pa pistear
Seguido me gusta Ruletear
Para capos buenos Michoacan
Ser del Aguaje pa mi es muy especial

4-50 y 4 dobleces
Hacer donas eso me divierte
Con mi guerita tuve un accidente
Las adrenalinas son mi fuerte
El BL 7 sigue aqui presente
Y salio quemando llanta en caliente
---------------------------------------------------
She saw it everywhere, in everything, the rhyme, the rhythm
And she pulled it from the air and made it clear
Like the bones and stones she found, shaped into a point and purpose
And her pen the arrow, her hand the bow

She said, "Make sure you're looking where you step
You've a tendency not to notice
There's an arrowhead underneath each of our noses
If we get out of our own heads and look around."

We just might see the trees like she did
Her father's heart and might in the forest
And they spoke to her like a daughter, so she planted more

She said, "Make sure you're looking where you step
You've a tendency not to notice
There's an arrowhead underneath each of our noses
If we get out of our own heads and look around."

The world's meant for our eyes and our eyes are meant for wonder
To see it in all, the rhyme, the rhythm
Ready to write are we the poet

She said, "Make sure you're looking where you step
You've a tendency not to notice
There's an arrowhead underneath each of our noses
If we get out of our own heads and look."
She said, "Make sure you're looking where you step
You've a tendency not to notice
There's an arrowhead."
---------------------------------------------------
Something got me feeling removed
Help me get myself in the groove
Thinking bout your body to sleep
Watch me when I walk in the room

Can we go back I need some simple things
Like riding my bike late at night
I'll tell you everything
I can get it in the morning morning (morning)
Watch the sun rise in the ocean
Yeah I don't want to think about
that always got me down
Everybody's something now
I'm just trying to break it down

This song don't mean shit my girl don't need that
All she wants is love and me to lean back
Chilling at the house no
just relax
Put my feet back and relax

Something got me feeling removed
Help me get myself in the groove
Thinking bout your body to sleep
Watch me when I walk in the room

Don't worry baby nobody gonna tell you where you wanna be
Don't worry baby nobody gonna follow you in front of me
Don't worry baby nobody gonna tell you where you wanna be
Don't worry baby nobody gonna follow you in front of me

This song don't mean shit my girl don't need that
All she wants is love and me to lean back
Chilling at the house no
just relax
Put my feet back and relax
---------------------------------------------------
Darling, I'm seeing double
Like you got two sides
And one don't treat me right
You're my idea of trouble
You know just what I like
But you hold it back in spite

If your love could talk
What would it say? Ayy
If your love could talk
What would it say? Ayy
You only call me when I'm on your mind
But when I need you, you don't have the time
If your love could talk
Would it have much to say? No...

You got me where you want me now
I'm thinking about
The words in your mouth
Why don't you just tell me
Do I have to spell it out for you? For you
Oh, don't keep me waiting
But you know I will if I have to

If your love could talk
What would it say? Ayy
If your love could talk
What would it say? Ayy
You only call me when I'm on your mind
But when I need you, you don't have the time
If your love could talk
Would it have much to say? No...

I tried to get, I tried to get through
But I'm unimportant
Now all I hear, all I hear, all I hear
Is static, comin' from your lips
And I don't think I deserve this
I don't think I deserve this
I don't think I deserve this

If your love could talk
What would it say? Ayy
If your love could talk
What would it say? Ayy
You only call me when I'm on your mind
But when I need you, you don't have the time
If your love could talk
Would it have much to say? No...

If your love could talk
If your love could talk
What would it say?
If your love could talk
If your love could talk
What would it say?

My body move-
(Getting stronger by the day)
My body move-

This music is built in me
There's no tilting me
I'd be lying if I said it ain't
You see the guilt in me

This ain't you
This is a forest fire
Fuel my flames

I'm so legit
I am the gunfire
Feel my pain

I came here to say
Light it up and spray it
It's in my molecular structure
Getting stronger by the day

Facing like a dragon
Causing inferno up in the booth
If I'm a general, burn it up
I get you moving

Get your body moving

B-b-body moving
Get your body moving

That beat you feel
The heat is real
Infected like a fever
Possessing your body
Converting all the non-believers

Is this an awakening
Or a holocaust
'Cause it cause my gravitational forces
That of a power horse

Your life force is fading
Welcome to my dark
Do you embark with bass drops
That chase you to my benchmark

You're racing higher and higher
Just like you're losing
My fire's sole desire is to get your body moving

My fire's sole desire is to get your body moving

Another panic attack
As I was browsing the stacks
And the books were falling in an avalanche
Though he sensed I was trapped
He was busy with... something

Now I'm checking my phone
But I don't want to talk
Don't wanna lopside my language
No I don't wanna go off

'Cause I lean in when I suffer
Lean in when I suffer

A panic attack
Though my directive's relax
It's beyond my skill set
Covetous of the calm wit
From a tyke uninvolved
All abyss with no clapback

I'm checking my phone
He's unworthy of talk
If he really wants to be the one
He'd forfeit shotgun for once

'Cause I lean in when I suffer
Lean in when I suffer

But I take him back to the county fair
I take him back, though he don't deserve to be there
He drew a bath and floated there
He cares a lot
We're strictly speaking self-care

Lean in when I suffer
Lean in when I suffer again
Lean in when I suffer
Lean in when I suffer again

Lean in when I suffer
Lean in when I suffer

Checking my phone
But I don't want to talk
Don't wanna lopside my language
No I don't wanna go

Hasta la carcel fui a parar
Por una rata que hay por ahi
Me pusieron un 4 en la ciudad de Buena Park
Me fueron agarrar

En medio de la transaccion
Cuando la D.E.A me procuro
No supe que es lo que paso
3 anos me avente en prision

Recuerdo una semana atras
Andabamos en Michoacan
Con mi carnal El Chapo andabamos bien enfiestados
Billetes habia de mas

No sabian si iba a calentar
Problemas habia en la ciudad
Al regresar de Michoacan
El 4 listo estaba ya

Ya no me quiero ni acordar
Libretas yo ya estoy pa' atras
Mi gente se ha quedado con mi gente mi trabajo
Mi puesto firmes estan

Un buen vino quiero tomar
A la Kush tengo que esperar
El Sapo mas que listo esta
Para empezar a traficar..

Un pantera en la jaula esta
Un amigazo de verdad
El bombo de los fieles amigazos
Que mi confianza le he sabido brindar

El gordito ese es mi carnal
Al black nos vamos a llamar
Quiubo carnal donde andaras
aqui llegando a Miramar

El show se quiso calentar
Ya volvio a la normalidad
El gordito anda fuera
Pero en uno se ha quedado la perra de Mazatlan

El Sapo bien firme aqui esta
Trae la silla de su carnal
Aqui lo vamos a esperar
La antorcha voy a calentar

De vuelta estoy en la ciudad
Queriendo ir pa' Michoacan
Regresamos mas fuertes y el dinero mas facil
Por la puerta lo vio llegar

El Sapo me dicen por ahi
Cerquita estoy de Apatzingan
Ya nos vamos a retirar
Vamos con rumbo a Mazatlan

Hollywood girls they got no respect

She said "You're in the movies, I'm in the magazines" (Hey)
"You're in the movies, I'm in the magazines" (Hey)
I wonder how pissed she'd get if you went home with me

Hollywood girls they got no respect
Modesty, no, it don't sign the checks
Sometimes you got to look behind the scenes
We take what we get, they take what they need

Shake it like a snapshot (Shake it like a snapshot)
Shake it like a Polaroid (Shake it like a Polaroid)
Let the camera lens pose all the questions
We don't want to ask tonight (We don't want to ask tonight)

I wonder how pissed she'd get if you went home with me

Say what, trying on trust and I
Just can't, talking about her like
She was the only thing that would
Ever matter in my life
I kept you hanging by with
Implications of a sleepless night
But the somebody called the line
You didn't care anymore

Shake it like a snapshot (Shake it like a snapshot)
Shake it like a Polaroid (Shake it like a Polaroid)
Let the camera lens pose all the questions
We don't want to ask tonight (We don't want to ask tonight)

En una troca bonita, una toyota por cierto
Asi se paseaba manny, siempre feliz y contento
Era de sangre valiente, michoacano cien por ciento

Domingo doce de marzo del dos mil doce corria
como a las seis de la tarde, dijo que pronto volvia aun no saben si esta vivo o si ya no esta con vida

Su madresita llorando llorando se lo decia
por favor hijito mio no te vallas este dia
tengo un mal presentimiento de que volveras sin vida

El nunca quizo escuchar los consejos de su madre y se empezo a involucrar en cosas irremediables y lo desaparecieron esas falsas amistades

Alla en phoenix arizona tenia muchas amistades, tambien alla en nueva italia
en sonora bien lo saben era pollero el muchacho apodado el aguacate

Sus carnales lo recuerdan siempre feliz y contento toquen el muchacho alegre con esas se acuerda el perro cuando siempre lo miraban quemando llanta en los cerros

Bitch I shop Whole Foods like I'm booooujie!
Pass the blunt, my mind is missing
Tweet my shit I need the mentions
Stop pretending
Look!

Riding round the city
Like a side bitch
Hermit till I die
Close the blinds bitch
Momma told me baby you's a prophet
So profit
And treat these fucking labels like a side - hold up
Fuck it dog had do it
Reviewers looking stupid
Stick to music
I'm am the Black God
Fuck a human
Stanley Kubrick
You know the rapping shit be therapeutic
Pitchfork told me to never be abusive
Unless I'm moving units
I see what the truth is
'Cause niggas preaching bout the pussy be the biggest douches
Wow

I'm out the window looking real stupid
Fuck that
It's young Sully
How I peep the ruins
Trust that
I whip the whip like the shit been boosted
My bus pass
Ain't been legit
Since I smashed Karrueche (not true)
These people thinking that they warriors
They straight kabuki
I hit your momma with Conker's Bad Fur Day
Goldeneye hit em up
Perfect Dark nigga for the job so I zip em up
And put em in a bag
Like I'm picking up dog shit

After the sun comes the rain
After the fall comes the pain
I'm on a sea of trouble love and my horizons are all blue
I'm on a bed of nails love and I'm laying there
I'm laying there
Calling on the city of love
Calling on the city of love
I don't want to wait at all
I don't want to wait at all
Calling on the city of love
Calling on the city of love
I don't want to break or fall
I don't want to break at all

After the high comes that low, that low
After the fire comes the growth, the growth
I'm on a sea of trouble love and my horizons are all blue
I'm on a bed of nails love and I'm laying there
I'm laying there
Calling on the city of love
Calling on the city of love
I don't want to wait at all
I don't want to wait at all
Calling on the city of love
Calling on the city of love
I don't want to break or fall
I don't want to break at all

It feels so strange
Shameless to think of death
When none of those one knows has died

Last night I dreamt I was dead
I came running with my dog into the room of the dead

There was nothing to be seen
Only stones and a few bushes
A landscape that travellers have often spoken of

I would rather not die here
But in my own home, where I was not dead

All the death
All the death
In the course of life and death

Write about death
Describe in the poem what you feel, concerning death

In the face of death I'm like an animal
And the animal can die but write nothing

The words die like flies
Their corpses everywhere, swept away from the white paper

Give the dirty little room
---------------------------------------------------
Our love is something
Baby, it is more than love
Our love is something
And now I just can't get enough

The walls are closing in
On me, oh my
The walls are closing in
On me right now
Just like a boat out on the open sea
Way out on the distance, those sirens sing for me
Like Moses he did divide the waves
Saved as an infant to free the slaves

Our love is something
Baby, it is more than love
Our love is something
And now I just can't get enough
I need your love
I need your love

Just like I'm starved, exhausted in this draft
I need a drink of water, oh boy, I need it fast
I'm stuck out in the desert and all I can see
Is you on the horizon, you waiting for me

Our love is something
Baby, it is more than love
Our love is something
And now I just can't get enough
I need your love
I need your love

I need your love
Well I need your kiss
Babe I need your love
Oh like every day

Our love is something
Baby, it is more than love
Our love is something
And now I just can't get enough
Our love is something
Baby, it is more than love
Our love is something
And now I just can't get enough
I need your love
I need your love

I need your love
---------------------------------------------------
More in like than I've ever been
The sweetest summer that I've ever seen
It's funny now that we were only sixteen
And though we've turned many pages by
I'll admit on occasion, I
Wonder how you've been doing since me

And I've heard from everybody else
That you're so much better without me
'Cause remember
That your friends are my friends

But you don't have to be a...
You say you're flying now I'm gone
Don't care about me no more
You think I'm crying, well, I'm not
I've never been quite this sure
But I don't wanna hear another word
'Cause I'm still a little hurt
So you can live without it
But you don't have to be a bitch about it

You don't have to be a...
But you don't have to be a...
You don't have to be a bitch about it

I saw you've moved to the city now
Got it all figured out
Went and got a boyfriend
Wouldn't your mother be proud (proud)
But you don't have to be a...
But still I wonder if you're ever bored
Of keeping score and measured pours
'Cause that don't sound like fun to me

And I've heard
You're done with being young
And you swear those days are behind you
But remember that I know you better

You don't have to be a...
You say you're flying now I'm gone
Don't care about me no more
You think I'm crying, well, I'm not
I've never been quite this sure
But I don't wanna hear another word
'Cause I'm still a little hurt
So you can live without it
But you don't have to be a bitch about it

You don't have to be a...
I'm kinda glad we didn't end it badly
'Cause you and I were never meant work it out
You don't have to be a...
You know I really wanna see you happy
But you don't have to be a...
No, you don't have to be a... hmm
No, no, no

You don't have to be a...
You say you're flying now I'm gone
Don't care about me no more
You think I'm crying, well, I'm not
I've never been quite this sure
But I don't wanna hear another word
'Cause I'm still a little hurt
So you can live without it
But you don't have to be a...
You say you're flying now I'm gone
Don't care about me no more
You think I'm crying, well, I'm not
I've never been quite this sure
But I don't wanna hear another word
'Cause I'm still a little hurt
So you can live without it
But you don't have to be a bitch about it

I'd like to tell you a story about
What one dance can do,
One dance can do
One dance can do

A listen up

After one dance on the floor
She came back, wanting for more
For more,
And I don't know what it is
That I've got, but she whispered it was so nice
So nice...
But her man is sitting across the way
And he can hear the things I'd say
Now he watches from the corner of his eyes
So a move like this would be so unwise
Ooh ooh he's standing in my way
Standing in my way hey yeah, yeah

You could see
She was more than ready
To make the move with me
Anytime,
Not even thinking of the consequences
Now now now
So I had to think quickly
Cause her man his face was looking oh so mean
As if anytime, he could create a scene
So gently I pushed her away

Ooh ooh, he wants to spoil the play
He's standing in my way... hey yeah
He's standing in my way yeah...

Woo ooh oohh...

Now I understand how he feels
But I wish he'd give me a little room
Just a little room
I didn't mean, to be so unkind
But I had to do what I had to do
Even though this woman was looking fine
Big spender he was, had to have his
Own way, I thought he'd leave, but he
Stayed, standing in my way...
Standing in my way yeah, yeah

Oooh oooh standing in my way hey
Standing...

That's what one dance can do...
---------------------------------------------------
What a day it would be
When we all have a heart to help the needy (Won't you help the needy)
Beres will you help us sing this one (Oh yes I will)

Oh help the needy

There'll come a time when you will hear a certain cry
Cry of need
There'll come a time when you will have to answer that call

Try all you can there is no way of getting around it
You got to

Give a little love where it's needed (You got to)

One day we've got to face the truth (Oh yeah yeah)
You are my brother and you are my sister too
So don't be laughing if the grass is greener on your side (On your side)
The love amongst all God's children has got to be intensified

So give a little love where it's needed (Can you? can you?)
Lend a helping hand where it's wanted (Give a helping hand)
You should help your neighbour who is falling (Yes you got to)
You will get your blessings ever rising (Ever rising)

If all you do is good and true
True in His name true for His name sake
Yes I tell you this is all we got to do

So give a little love where it's needed (Yes you got to)
Lend a helping hand where it's wanted (Where it's needed)
You should help your neighbour who is falling
You will get your blessings ever rising (Ever rising)
Give a little love where it's needed (Oh yes you got to)
Lend a helping hand where it's wanted (Come on come on)

You didn't have to be so nice
I would have liked you anyway
If you had just looked once or twice
And gone upon your quiet way

Today I said the time was right for me to follow you
I knew I'd find you in a day or two
And it's true

You came upon a quiet day
You simply seemed to take your place
I knew that it would be that way
The minute that I saw your face

And when we've had a few more days (When we've had a few more days)
I wonder if I'll get to say (Wonder if I'll get to say)
You didn't have to be so nice (Be so nice)
I would have liked you anyway (Would have liked)

Today I said the time was right for me to follow you
(Today, said that the time was right to follow you)
I knew I'd find you in a day or two
(I knew that I would find you in a day or two)
And it's true

You didn't have to be so nice (Didn't have to be so nice)
I would have liked you anyway (Would have liked you anyway)
If you had just looked once or twice (Once or twice)
And gone upon your quiet way (Quiet way)
---------------------------------------------------
I was walking through icy streams
That took my breath away
Moving slowly through westward water
Over glacial plains

And I walked off you
And I walked off an old me
Oh me oh my I thought it was a dream
So it seemed

And now, breathe deep
I'm inhaling
You and I, there's air in between
Leave me be
I'm exhaling
You and I, there's air in between
You and I, there's air in between

Cut my hair so I could rock back and forth
Without thinking of you
Learned to talk and say
Whatever I wanted to

And I walked off you
And I walked off an old me
Oh me oh my
I thought it was a dream
So it seemed

And now, breathe deep
I'm inhaling
You and I, there's air in between
Leave me be
I'm exhaling
You and I, there's air in between

You and I, there's air in between
You and I, there's air in between
---------------------------------------------------
Ayy, yeah, ew
Yuh, yuh, yuh!

Nah, for real
Fuck how a broke nigga feel
Nah, for real
She tryna' live for the thrill
Nah, for real
She comin' straight from the hill
Nah, for real
Pour up a cup til' it spill

Go get a bag, run it up
Don't got no time for a slut
Smoking and drinking too much
Backwoods for breakfast & lunch
I do this shit on the regular
Want the OG not the regular
Don't want that bitch cos' she regular
Treat the Hi-Tech like it's medicine
Check out the Rollie, it's president

full of bitches, she
(bitch)
You not the plug, but you selling it
You not the plug (for real)
Walk in the club and spent a dub
Come from the mud
Step in the crib
Bape on the rug (Southside)

Nah, for real
Fuck how a broke nigga feel
Nah, for real
She tryna' live for the thrill
Nah, for real
She comin' straight from the hill
Nah, for real
Pour up a cup til' it spill
---------------------------------------------------
If I was a warrior
What would be my weapon
Forgiveness
Laughter
Sound
My riches sky and ground
Like the smell of pine
In forests that drip divine
Darkness sublime
In a blue sky mind
Stainless

Turn the pages of a story of circles
Where I am that I am
Where all paths join hands in the lands I remember
Where I am returned to my sender
Fully surrounded I surrender

Where the darkness illumines
My doubts lay in ruin
---------------------------------------------------
I've been searching for the right one eh
I've been searching for you all along
Darling, I'm searching no more
Searching
Baby girl you're a such a miracle
Thank your mama, you're beautiful
I'll take my time with you, I'll take it slow

Girl I am loving you for days
Anytime you call my name be like I dey craze
Ibadi e lokun o (di e di e lokun o)

Anytime you call my name be like I dey craze

Girl I am loving you for days
Anytime you call my name be like I dey craze
Ibadi e lokun o (di e di e lokun o)
---------------------------------------------------
And we sit here so close in the dark
And we're so close to being torn apart
Ever crash I can feel in our foundation
It runs through my veins and I hate the sensation
But I know that I'm safe here with you
Cause we made it through everything the old and the new
Just wake me up when all this is over
Wake me up and tell me it's not true

My sweet love watch the air raids
As the streets of London are not safe
And I wish that we could escape
As the beat of the drum keeps on its play
And I long to feel the rain on my face
So I wait, I want the bombs to fade away

And the hum of the airplanes is such a sweet sound
As we're coming up from underground
Coming up to see our ruined state
Coming up to see those ruins that you made
And in the east I hear a nation shout
And we wait for the day that we can sing it out

My sweet love watch the air raids
As the streets of London are not safe
And I wish that we could escape
As the beat of the drum keeps on its play
And I long to feel the rain on my face
So I wait, I want the bombs to fade away

(Sing it out)
(Sing it out)

(My, my, my, my)
My sweet love watch the air raids
As the streets of London are not safe
And I wish that we could escape
As the beat of the drum keeps on its play
And I long to feel the rain on my face
So I wake
---------------------------------------------------
Judge have me fucking up my reflex
I reel up then I refocus
Caught five of them, then I caught another three
Buss them up blood up the whole community
Hustling with my grinders and my fugitives
Ain't nobody have time for no excuses, no
Baby mama tripping off my new bitch
New bitch tripping bout my baby mama

Gotta smoke some week I'll be stressin (stressin)
Gotta smoke some week I'll be stressin (stressin)
The homie on leaf cause he's stressin
Gotta smoke some week I'll be stressin (stressin)

Tired of what they playing on the radio
I just bout these dealers have got dirt on them
Police picked the homie said they had dirt on him
He would be free but his mama snitched
My daughter always smiling because daddy rich
Police killing black people everyday
I'll be ducking white niggas everyday
But I'll be fucking white bitches everyday

Gotta smoke some week I'll be stressin (stressin)
Gotta smoke some week I'll be stressin (stressin)
The homie on leaf cause he's stressin
Gotta smoke some week I'll be stressin (stressin)
Gotta smoke some week I'll be stressin (stressin)
Gotta smoke some week I'll be stressin (stressin)
The homie on leaf cause he's stressin
Gotta smoke some week I'll be stressin (stressin)

Look!
Made it from nothing that's real story
Progress you've gotta be pro-active

Get on my bad side then it's lights out
Fuck the fast and the future, it's bout right now
His demons gonna get me chilli cheese fries
Stuck thirty thousand in these hutches
Shockas jus can't wait to catch a nigga slip
Bitch going through my phone when she suspicious
I love to drive alone on the freeway
Before I make it home to smoke 3 J's
Gotta smoke some weed I'll be stressin

Gotta smoke some week I'll be stressin (stressin)
Gotta smoke some week I'll be stressin (stressin)
The homie on leaf cause he's stressin
Gotta smoke some week I'll be stressin (stressin)
Gotta smoke some week I'll be stressin (stressin)
Gotta smoke some week I'll be stressin (stressin)
The homie on leaf cause he's stressin
Gotta smoke some week I'll be stressin (stressin)

Pick up the phone
Please, tell me you're home
The monsters are gone
The wardrobe is closed
Where's my guitar
They hate when I sing
So, fuck my guitar, yeah
Fuck everything

Mmmm mmmm

String's on a twist
My ass they can kiss
They're making me sick
Just, go suck my dick
No, singing past ten
You can't stay in your bed
So, fuck mom and dad
I'm going real mad

Mmmm mmmm
---------------------------------------------------
Yo they're saying I'm a star, there's no turning back
But I'm finding it hard to stop serving packs
Yo these niggas ain't real, and I'm learning that
Start talking like some hoes, when she turned your back
I fuck with that, we're in these streets
And you'd think she was the feds, how she's into me
Yo I'm Fred, I turn 28s into 3
And my diamonds turn dinner dates into freaks
Pussy

I heard you wanna come to my shows
But my visits in jail, you weren't coming to those
3 3 smoke that's my youngen on go
And this chain round my neck, cost me hundreds of O's
When it was time to ride, you was always in your crib
When it was time to ride, I was always in the whip
A 9 bar of benzocaine is always in the brick
That's a mortgage on my wrist
She's fucking bummy niggas, I ain't talking to the chick
In Nobu with my nigga, like I'm ordering the shrimp
We used to have no place to go, it's pouring on the strip
Now you can't find a man my age that's saucing on the kid
Yo, of couse I'm gonna win
And if you grew up in hell, then of course you're gonna sin
When I put the prezzie on my wrist, you're talking to a king
Every month I have a boxing walking the ring
And my pinky's nearly ready it's like water in the ring

Yo they're saying I'm a star, there's no turning back
But I'm finding it hard to stop serving packs
Yo these niggas ain't real, and I'm learning that
Start talking like some hoes, when she turned your back
I fuck with that, we're in these streets
And you'd think she was the feds, how she's into me
Yo I'm Fred, I turn 28s into 3
And my diamonds turn dinner dates into freaks
Pussy

30 points on my pinky ring, yeah it's glistening
Started rapping last year, now everybody's listening
We step up in Harrods, and stress up the badders
Young niggas like me might mess up your marriage
I'm all on my block, cos we're all that we got
Gotta order my watch, and it's pouring with rocks
We been touring a lot
So shouts to the fans, cos they're riding as well
Came a long way from fighting in jail
Rough nights, grinding was hell
She's up on my insta, liking as well
I think she wan buss it, but timing will tell
I flex in the hood and I'm violent as well
So I'm dodging these bitches, Trident as well
No slipping up
Bro's in the kitchen, and bro's whipping up
At first it was hard, there was no giving up
So I fly to the Shard just to show I'm a star

Yo they're saying I'm a star, there's no turning back
But I'm finding it hard to stop serving packs
Yo these niggas ain't real, and I'm learning that
Start talking like some hoes, when she turned your back
I fuck with that, we're in these streets
And you'd think she was the feds, how she's into me
Yo I'm Fred, I turn 28s into 3
And my diamonds turn dinner dates into freaks
Pussy

Something got me feeling better than I could
Roll the weed up, light it, smoke it, like I should

Something got me feeling better than I could
Roll the weed up, light it, smoke it, like I should...

Something got me feeling better than I could
Roll the weed up, light it, smoke it, like I should

Something got me feeling better than I could
Roll the weed up, light it, smoke it, like I should

Lately I can't focus
Work too much
And deal with bullshit
On my day off
I'm just hoping
That my day one
Isn't broken up
About me working late and stuff
Today I'll eat some cake for lunch
Go back to my room
And watch another show
Like everyone

Lately I can't focus
Work too much
And deal with bullshit

Lately I can't focus
Work too much
And deal with bullshit

Lately I can't focus
Work too much
And deal with bullshit

Lately I can't focus
Work too much
And deal with bullshit

Tempted by something I can't describe

Like a moth caught in a web

That I'm not the boy I once was
So I'll seek the truth
I speak, I see
And I hear you

Evil, evil like you
Evil, evil like you
Evil, evil like you

Seduced by the whispers
Coming straight from your soft lips
Rapid waves crashing through
Sinking my ships
This entity
Is leaving me so blue
I speak, I see
And I hear you

Evil, evil like you
Evil, evil like you
Evil, evil like you

Evil, evil like you
Evil, evil like you
Evil, evil like

Can we talk in the morning?
I'm no use tired and upset
Oh, just leave it out for the morning
It'll sleep fine in our bed

I don't wanna think about it
Don't wanna empathize
It's too late at night

We always said we shouldn't talk like this
You're frustrated, we should sleep on it
And a stubborn mind should learn to quit while it's ahead
And I can tell I hit a nerve with you
That's what talking late at night will do
Taking turns for the worse

I can say anything I mean
When it's past midnight and I've been drinking
Oh, and we'll just get mad and emotional
If we try to face it when we should be sleeping

I don't wanna think about it
Don't wanna empathize
It's too late at night

We always said we shouldn't talk like this
You're frustrated, we should sleep on it
And a stubborn mind should learn to quit while it's ahead
And I can tell I hit a nerve with you
That's what talking late at night will do
Taking turns for the worse

We always said we shouldn't talk like this
You're frustrated, we should sleep on it
And a stubborn mind should learn to quit while it's ahead
And I can tell I hit a nerve with you
That's what talking late at night will do
Taking turns for the worse
Taking turns for the worse

You are narcotic
You took me into custody
Out of the blue
With these eyes like a jail
Eyes like a jail
I was walking
Walking so long
Now I see light, now I feel strong
Right here by your side
Right by your side

And you're running inside of my head all the time
Get you out of my thoughts, get you out of my mind
You are running
Baby, inside, you are running
In your arms I feel safe, in your eyes I can see
Deep at night, in my dreams, you are talking to me
You are running
Inside my head, you are running
You are

You keep that letter
Open your eyes
It's not a matter of the one disguise
You have saved me today
Saved me today
We know it well
Don't you think twice
Look how the storm has opened the skies
In a silent dream
In a silent dream

And you're running inside of my head all the time
Get you out of my thoughts, get you out of my mind
You are running
Baby, inside, you are running
In your arms I feel safe, in your eyes I can see
Deep at night, in my dreams, you are talking to me
You are running
Inside my head, you are running
You are running

And we need to rise
`Cause we need to rise
And we all break through lines
In time, in time

And you're running inside of my head all the time
Get you out of my thoughts, get you out of my mind
You are running
Baby, inside, you are running
In your arms I feel safe, in your eyes I can see
Deep at night, in my dreams, you are talking to me
You are running
Inside my head, you are running

Goodbye baby
I have to save the world tomorrow
I have to let the sun shine in our hearts again
I have to get out and make it
But honey, I'm gonna do it in style

Dreams
They grow in silent places
Somewhere deep inside
Tears
They dry on the smiling faces
Birds
Got wings to fly

And when the stars
Explode tonight
We have to kiss
This life
Goodbye

Goodbye baby
We have to save the world tomorrow
We have to let the sunshine in our hearts again (oh yeah)
Goodbye baby
This life is much too short for sorrow
We have to find a way to end the days we spend
Together I know we can make it
And honey, we're gonna do it in style

I did not mean
What I have said, I'm sorry
Before the world
Is falling into pieces
I change my mind
Right now
But you just tell me

Fuck you baby
You have to save the world tomorrow
You have to let the sunshine in your heart again (oh yeah)
Fuck you baby
This life is much too short for sorrow
We have to find a way to end this punishment
You have to admit that maybe
You'd better, you'd better
You'd better bring it to the end
---------------------------------------------------
It's a new day
Now the morning is breaking
In the light of the sun you can find
A new way
When the world is awaking
You can leave all the darkness behind
Anyone of us
Anyone can fail
Don't you be afraid

It's a new day
In the break of the dawning
The needle returns to the start
A new chance
While the night veils are falling
You can open your eyes and your heart
Anything can be
Don't you be afraid
See that skies of blue
Will return to you today
And say

It's a new world
It's a new world
It's a new life
You just have to get in

And you see the whole world
With the eyes of a child
And she sends you the light
That you need to survive
It's the day you can get everything that you need
When you try to be yourself

It's a new world (everything can be)
It's a new world (anything you need)
It's a new life (anything)
You just have to get in

It's a new day
And the sun will be shining
For the rest of your glorious life

Crawfish
Well I went to the bayou just last night
There was no moon but the stars were bright
Put a big long hook on a big long pole
And I pulled Mr. Crawfish out of his hole
Crawfish

See I got him, see the size
Stripped and cleaned before your eyes
Sweet meat look, fresh and ready to cook
Crawfish

Now take Mr. Crawfish in your hand
He's gonna look good in your frying pan
If you fry him crisp or you boil him right
He'll be sweeter than sugar when you take a bite
Crawfish
---------------------------------------------------
And I get no sleep
I dream underwater
Whales and
as they roll in my dreams
We can talk about it

And I get no sleep
But I dream underwater
I waste all my years laying under the stars
Just dreaming 'bout it

Resting my bones just waiting for silence
We could all use a little more quiet
With my diary on the desk
Screaming at me

It's an ineffable thing
With the wind soaring on the wind
Through the nefarious night
A cold hand touches me
Pulls me deep underwater
I'm free

A quiver I keep I think, It's time
Down to the deep below
Struggling to see
Fades black
Whales
At my back

calls me home and I
Breathe underwater and so
Now I'm brand new

And I get no sleep
But I dream underwater
---------------------------------------------------
Yeah
They told me keep it pure
Caught up in the allure
But see that's not what I'm looking for
Wasn't sure
I wanted more

Tell no lies
Tell me no lies
Tell no lies
Tell me no lies
Tell no lies
Tell me no lies

Yeah
Was born into a hell
So you already feel
They say don't live life on the edge
Man I might as well
Yeah

Tell no lies
Tell me no lies
Tell no lies
Tell me no lies
Tell no lies
Tell me no lies

Yeah
Better brace yourself, brace yourself
We're close to the end, save yourself
You out for the money, make your wealth
Move silent, don't waste your breath
Do better 'cause they never taught us stocks and bonds
Only taught designer clothes, gold chains rocking charms
So I hardly paid attention, in my hood you feel the tension
Well I'd rather make it flipping than to go pay a tuition
Always listen when they said to hold your head
Lives ruined
Better days are on the way
But I think they all lied to us

Yeah
Told us to keep it pure
Caught up in the allure
But see that's not what I'm looking for
Wasn't sure
I wanted more

Tell no lies
Tell me no lies
Tell no lies
Tell me no lies
Tell no lies
Tell me no lies

Teacher teacher why you keep feeding me false
Information taught is just a way to keep me lost
Said you here to make me brighter but you keep me in the dark
Told me turn the chapter and remember everything you taught
Educated fool that's why we hated school
I guess I'm different, had me venting 'bout my teachers
But my preacher wasn't no different
Mama picked up on tradition of religion, I knew it
Had to break tradition, told mama they lied to us

Yeah
Told us to keep it pure
Caught up in the allure
But see that's not what I'm looking for
Wasn't sure
I wanted more

Tell no lies

Make me hate to love, make me hate to love
Make me hate to love, make me hate to love
Make me take the drugs, oh no, take the drugs, oh n-


Make me hate to love, make me hate to love
Swear I open up, but you ain't the one
But you left me here, why you bring me here?
Why the change of plans? We all selfish
I said, "I hate to love but I love the drugs
'Cause they make me numb, help me function"
And this all stemmin' from things, you set it off

Guess I'm better off


I feel like I need you
The way you talk, the way you move
All the things you do, all the things you do
They make me feel crazy, I question myself
Don't want nothing else but all the things you do
You make it hard, you make it hard, I make it easy

Hate to love, hate to love, hate to love, hate to love
Hate to love, hate to love, hate to love, hate to love (you make it hard)
Hate to love, hate to love, hate to love, hate to love (I make it easy)
Hate to love, hate to love, hate to love, hate to love (you make it hard, I make it easy)


I said, "hate to love", you can't blame me
For the fact that you made me a monster
Told you that you could have my baby
At this point, I'ma take back that offer, unh
Always argue, get you started, it
Drive me crazy, get my car keys, aye
Ain't no talkin', no, I try to walk away
Put hands in my face, bitch get off me
No, I don't want it, you ungrateful
What you thinkin'? All them payments, yea
All them flights home, you brought that baggage
I still accept you, you turn me savage
I'd like to thank you, left me heartless
Now I lean, duck, dodge, my guard up
I can't afford it, I fuckin' skate
Now Mr. Heartbreak like 808


I feel like I need you
The way you talk, the way you move
All the things you do, all the things you do
They make me feel crazy, I question myself
Don't want nothing else but all the things you do
You make it hard, you make it hard, I make it easy

Hate to love, hate to love, hate to love, hate to love
Hate to love, hate to love, hate to love, hate to love (you make it hard)
Hate to love, hate to love, hate to love, hate to love (I make it easy)
Hate to love, hate to love, hate to love, hate to love (you make it hard, I make it easy)
Hate to love, hate to love, hate to love, hate to love
Hate to love, hate to love, hate to love, hate to love (you make it hard)

And I remember when we were fuckin'
Now I'm writin' love songs about how we were
And I ever knew that that was something yeah
Then maybe I'd sing these words to you girl and

I never thought that we
Had something special like ice and tea
Compatible despite their ethnicity
And differences they were meant to be
That tastes so sweet lemon and peach
I'm so sorry I did not believe in us

I keep on thinkin' about what we had and how stupid I've been Fucking drama queen always overthinking
When I should've been listenin' to what's true
I pursued something new
Whether you would find it so difficult to do
I stopped myself from falling in two
Love with someone so beautiful, someone beautiful aah

And I remember when we were fuckin'
And now I'm writin' love songs about how we were once
And if I ever knew that was something yeah
Then maybe I'd sing these words to you girl and-

Looking back I realize, I had something that these other guys
Would never get in their life and I took you for granted
I apologize
I didn't know what I had until it was gone
Cause my mind was still young
But I'm grateful for your love
Cause now I know at least there's one
You can fall in love with, care for and see the world with
And I don't even know why I did it
Why'd I let you go?
Drink smoke and dine with, laugh, joke, and share a life with
And I don't even know why I did it
Why'd I let you go?

And I remember when we were fuckin' oh
And now I'm writin' love songs about how we were once
And if I ever knew that was something oh I
Then maybe I'd sing these words to you girl and-

Since you and I
I've struggled to find anything that I like
We had something special
I'm sorry that I couldn't see that now
I was naive at the time other things on my mind
Seeking reason, what is the meaning
This life is deceiving
Yeah, I know that we weren't perfect
But if it's easy it's fucking not worth it

And well I remember when we were fuckin' oh
And now I'm writin' love songs about how we were once
And well if I ever knew that was something oh
Then maybe I would sing these words to you my love

And well I remember when we were fuckin' oh
And now I'm writin' love songs about how we were once
If I ever knew that that was something oh
Then maybe I'll sing these words maybe I'll sing

So how you doing anyway?
You okay are you keeping safe?
I heard you're getting engaged to somebody that's better than me
Well, how you doing anyway?
Are you okay are you keeping safe?
I heard you're getting engaged to somebody that's better than me
---------------------------------------------------
There's no wrong, there's no God
There's no harm, there's no love
We are more like you
Than the ones that you knew

Phantom road, erased address
Duplicate queen, dismantled cross
We are more like you
Than the ones that you knew

Is it that we know we are animals
Or because to them we are animals
You're inventing words for defending me
While lined up to shoot for the enemy
While lined up to shoot for the enemy
You're inventing words for defending me
It's because to them we are animals
Or because we know we are animals

Concrete soul, machine-read heart
Poison creed, primate savant
We are more like you
Than the ones that you knew

Is it that we know we are animals
Or because to them we are animals
You're inventing words for defending me
While lined up to shoot for the enemy
While lined up to shoot for the enemy
You're inventing words for defending me
It's because to them we are animals
Or because we know we are animals

Is it that we know we are animals
Or because to them we are animals
You're inventing words for defending me
While lined up to shoot for the enemy
While lined up to shoot for the enemy
You're inventing words for defending me
It's because to them we are animals
Or because we know we are animals

There's no wrong, there's no God
There's no harm, there's no love
We are more like you
Than the ones that you knew

Ninety miles an hour through an electric storm
Just another town or two until New Mexico
"Can you feel it? I can feel it, too"

Why does my Coca-Cola taste like gasoline?
I see you fightin' back a grin
You think you're foolin' me

I can't believe it
I can't believe you'd do that to me, Ruby

"I bet you ten dollars I can guess your name
Suzy Burlingame?
Or Judy Gables? Or is it Maybelle?
I'm sure it's Eleanor
Maybe Sable? I've never met a Sable
I'm sure it's Eleanor"

Why's the porch light on? I thought you'd flipped the breaker
And who's that moving around inside?
Oh Ruby, I'm too young to die

Would you go in with me?
I want you by my side

"I bet you ten dollars I can guess your name
Suzy Burlingame?
Judy Gables? Or is it Maybelle?
Nah, I'm sure it's Eleanor"
---------------------------------------------------
If I want to restart us
Can we go right now
Loose our flaws and harness
And we don't look down

Watching the waves I
Wait for the tide to run out

Forget my body
Send me some piece of mind
I'll hold my hands up
If you lay to rest your fire

Give me your reasons
I'll take away the meaning

Oh, and I'm telling you this feels like

It's like I'm running under, running underwater
It's like I'm running under, running underwater with you
It's like I'm running under, running underwater
It's like I'm running under, running underwater with you

If I want to break paths
Can we leave right now
Keep my ego guarded
And never let me down

Tell me you're leaving
Tell me you've changed your mind
Oh now we're talking about love in the midnight

It's like I'm running under, running underwater
It's like I'm running under, running underwater with you
It's like I'm running under, running underwater
It's like I'm running under, running underwater with you

And I, just need some piece of mind
You, find it tiring
Tell me, where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?

It's like I'm running under, running underwater
It's like I'm running under, running underwater with you
It's like I'm running under, running underwater
It's like I'm running under, running underwater with you

Now, the prodigal son was a forward child, his mind was not to obey
But after he left his father's house he thought he had gone astray

I believe that, I believe that I will go back home
I believe that, I believe that I will go back home
I believe that, I believe that I will go back home
And be a servant of the Lord

His father saw him coming he met him with a smile
He threw his arms around him saying this is my darling child

I believe that, I believe that I will go back home
I believe that, I believe that I will go back home
I believe that, I believe that I will go back home
And be a servant of the Lord

The father asked the prodigal, son, why you've been gone so long?
One day you sold out the world and forget your happy home
The prodigal said, I searched for true religion, but no faith and no peace could I find
Until I came to a little place called Bakersfield, that eased my troublin' mind

I believe that, I believe that I will go back home
I believe that, I believe that I will go back home
I believe that, I believe that I will go back home
And be a servant of the Lord

I wandered into a tavern where a music band was playin'
The steel guitar rang out so sweet, I feel like I was prayin'
And I asked a comely waitress, is this a new teaching
She said there is no God but God, and Ralph Mooney is his name
I said, let me empty your ashtray, Mr. Mooney, if the drunks interfere I'll be sad
But just as long as you sit there on the bandstand and play your guitar like Buddha, I'll be glad
The father asked the prodigal, did you smell the sweet perfume and hear the angel band?
He said, dim lights, thick smoke, and loud, loud music is the only kind of truth I'll ever understand

I believe that, I believe that I will go back home
I believe that, I believe that I will go back home
I believe that, I believe that I will go back home
And be a servant of the Lord

J'suis avec le zin autour d'une chicha raisin
J'appelle mon cousin, j'lui demande de descendre
Elle a trop tise, elle me fait remarquer
Elle fait que tmeniker, j'lui demande de s'detendre
J'suis sur l'bitume, petit polo Prestance
J'titube, il est 13h petante
J'prends ma petite, j'l'emmene sur un port de Plaisance
Poches remplies, j'profite de ce moment de detente
Tchok a 50, liasses de 50
Ta gadji coute pas cher, meme pas 50
L'argent vient vite, mon cousin, il part vite
La con de sa tante, t'facon j'vais mourir avant 50
L'avenir est a nous faut tout niquer maintenant
Faut tout niquer maintenant
Un peu d'Givenchy, un peu d'Versace
Quelques Lacoste, quelques Lieutenant

A trop faire du sale la street m'en redemande
De quoi tu parles, t'es personne aucune redevance
Tu nous connais, tu connais notre provenance
T'entends parler d'mon equipe dans La Provence
A trop faire du sale la street m'en redemande

J'ai change d'voiture
Y a meme pas deux ans ma 'ture coutait meme pas le prix de un d'mes vetements
Retiens qu'une chose, pour nous 70
Tu nous fais l'blinde, tu touches 9%
J'ai grimpe quelques etapes, sans piston
Chicos petes, les yeux petes
J'te vois tourner dans la zone avec ta vieille caisse que ta salope t'a pretee
J'ai la haine, j'ai la haine
Sortir un titre, tourner un clip, frerot, j'ai la flemme
Hier ca tirait devant l'bar
J'suis rentre tard, j'me suis reveille tard
J'recompte ma part, j'fume un petard
J'regarde son petard, frerot j'me regale

Au feu ce fou furieux veut qu'on s'tire la bourre

Des billets eparpilles, tu connais l'equipe, le square est quadrille
Dans la cave j'en ai un, il en reste que deux dans l'barillet

But I wanna take it slow, bae hope you honor what I'm sayin'

First spark my interest (one), unlock my mind (two)
Then make me loyal (three), 'fore you get between my thighs (four)
Wanna feel your touch, but I don't wanna rush
When the time is right I'ma give you all this love
Ain't sayin' chase it, just sayin' bae be patient

But let's face it, I want it too, boy I can't hide it

You make me feel a certain type of way
I know you want it now but baby I'll be worth the wait
My body's callin', it's callin' your name

This here wetter than a hose, when you get a baddie, show off
Go off, hold on, 'til the time is right
And when it is boy I'm gon' fuck you all night, you make me

You make me feel a certain type of way
I know you want it now but baby I'll be worth the wait
My body's callin', it's callin' your name

Cause your own niggas tried to get at me
I'm far from average and see you done got too comfortable

Chasing another nigga bitch

Make me feel like you're mine
(One more time)

And it's just for tonight
(One more time)
Can I get one more time?
(One more time)
Boy I know what you like
(One more time)
Make me feel like you're mine
And it's just for tonight

One more time
(Just one more time)
One more time
(One more time)

Can I fuck?
And make you lose your mind
(Make you lose your mind)

Lay you down
Make you remember all the times
(Remember all times)

I drove you crazy
Boy you know that you can't lie
(You know that you can't lie)
The way I'm scratching your back up (Up)
You would beat it up (It up)

We fucking up the sheets, baby
(The sheets)
Know you miss my love
(My love)

Just gon' and eat it one more time, freak it one more time
I need it one more time, one more time, one more time

Don't look away
This is now the moment that you know that you have waited for wait no more
This is your time right here
No one can believe something all the time
You fall out
Someday you'll fall back in
But it's coming for you now
With your hope burning in its hand
The armour you've grown

You will not fear them, breathing inside of the armour you own
You will not see them all waiting in line for the armour you grow
Is the armour you own

Brace, this is just the game
Find your shelter in your calm and take comfort in your harm
Don't look away
This is just the moment that you know that you create
So wait no more in this feeling

You will not see them all waiting in line for the armour you grow
Is the armour you own

You will reach
You will fall down
Every time you fail you will change
You will break open this light
And from it you will know the way
I won't leave
You will step out from the tower that has kept you safe
Home will be where you are now

Know that this place must end
Know that this temple I built you'll shed
You will awake to your consciousness
Stand up and know now that you are the one who shapes
But know when to give if the heart dictates
Show all the empathy that you own with each moment
Keep nothing safe, you will grow from harm
The further you fall you return to own
Know that you'll always be chasing something
And it's ok

You will reach
You will fall down
Every time you fail you will change
You will break open this light
And from it you will know the way
I won't leave
You will step out from the tower that has kept you safe
Home will be where you are now

Hey there lonely one
Did you think that you would die alone?
I don't think you want to know
Hey there lonely one
When you try to leave the world this way
You're not the only one that goes

But you say so long
'Cause you're too far gone to waste away
Long enough to call home

Stealing life's a way to go alone
Stealing life's a way to move along
'Cause you're too far gone
You won't be there to help us carry on

Bye bye lonely one
What was it that you wanted to say?
You've gone and thrown your voice away
And now the lonely one
I wish he'd read the notes inside his head
I don't think I'd want to know

'Cause you say so long
'Cause you're too far gone to waste away
Long enough to call home

Stealing life's a way to go alone
Stealing life's a way to move along
'Cause you're too far gone
You won't be there to help us carry on

Bye bye lonely one
What was it that you wanted to say
Waste away
Long enough to call home

Stealing life's a way to carry on
Stealing life's a way to go alone
Stealing life's a way to move along
'Cause you're too far gone
You won't be there to help us carry on
To help us carry on
To help us carry on

You are too far gone to help us carry on
You are too far gone to help us carry on
You are too far gone to help us carry on

He doesn't fight crime or wear a cape
He doesn't read minds or levitate
But every time my world needs saving, he's my superman
Some folks don't believe in heroes 'cause they haven't met my dad

He loves his workshop and rock and roll
He's got a hot rod and a heart of gold
And you could say he's a man of few words, but he talks a lot within
And even though I'm a little taller, I still look up to him

He built me a house in the arms of a tree
He taught me to drive, and to fight, and to dream
When he looks in my eyes I hope he can see
That my dad's a hero to me

Rust-ridden fenders, and doors full of dings
Somehow he can fix about anything
I didn't think he knew how to cry till our dog died that year
He doesn't always say I love you, but I can hear him loud and clear

He built me a house in the arms of a tree
He taught me to drive, and to fight, and to dream
When he looks in my eyes I hope he can see
That my dad's a hero to me

He built me a house in the arms of a tree
He taught me to drive, and to fight, and to dream
When he looks in my eyes I hope he can see
That my dad's a hero to me

My dad's a hero to me
My dad's a hero to me
---------------------------------------------------
I want a home, I want a home with marble floors, with marble floors
And a love I can hold, a love I can hold, when those floors get cold
And she'll dance on my toes, she'll dance on my toes
As the evening grows, the evening grows
Through the chimney we'll float, through the chimney we'll float
From the clouds I'll make her a coat

And those neon lights fill the sky so bright
My home is tired, it's burnt, on fire from the love that has died
Take the smarts that survived from the ashes, tonight

Ladadada
Ladadadada
Ladadadada
Lada
Ladadada
Ladadadada
Ladadadada
Lada

I want a home, I want a home with marble floors, with marble floors
And a love I can hold, a love I can hold
When those floors get cold
And she'll dance on my toes, she'll dance on my toes
As the evening grows, the evening grows
Through the chimney we'll float, through the chimney
And from the clouds I'll make her a coat, I'll make you a coat

Putas, drogas y carro'
Haciendo trompos en el barro
Fumando en el escenario
Pero sin ti nada me divierte

Oyeme, escuchame
Si no estoy contigo nada me sabe bien
Me seco las lagrima' con billetes de cien
No tengo ningun sueno si no estas en el
Oyeme, escuchame
Si no estoy contigo nada me sabe bien
Me seco las lagrima' con billetes de cien
No tengo ningun sueno si no estas en el, oh

¿De que me sirve estar siempre colocado?
Baby, si ahora ya no te tengo a mi lado
¿Para que el dinero si tu me has dejado?
¿Para que que me recuerden si me has olvidado? tu
Ninguna de las demas me lo hacen como lo hacias tu-uh-uh
Y si me muero meteme algo tuyo en el atau'
Antes todo era igual de oscuro pero me dabas luz
Y ahora desde que te has ido noto el peso de la cru'
Dormia con tu cabeza en mi pecho como Vick VapoRub
Y ahora el hueco de tu cama, mami, me hace perder el flush

Oyeme, escuchame
Si no estoy contigo nada me sabe bien
Me seco las lagrima' con billetes de cien
No tengo ningun sueno si no estas en el
Oyeme, escuchame
Si no estoy contigo nada me sabe bien
Me seco las lagrima' con billetes de cien
No tengo ningun sueno si no estas en el

Desde que te fuiste ya no pienso en otra cosa
En mis tripa' solo mi alma, y hay mariposa'
Yo solo queria ser tu puto y tu mi esposa
Y ahora me arrepiento pero esa ya no importa, noo
Ahora solo me rodeo de mierda, problemas y dope
Ninguna me rula como tu me rulabas el porro-oh-oh
Me lloran los ojos de rezarte como mirando al so'-oh-oh
Y acabo drogado como siempre metido en mi habitacion

Me lloran los ojos de rezarte como mirando al sol-oh-oh
Y acabo drogado como siempre yo, fuck

Oyeme, escuchame
Si no estoy contigo nada me sabe bien
Me seco las lagrima' con billetes de cien
No tengo ningun sueno si no estas en el
Oyeme, escuchame
Si no estoy contigo nada me sabe bien
Me seco las lagrima' con billetes de cien
No tengo ningun sueno si no estas en el

Duffle bag, backseat
My dash, your feet
Those other side of the highway headlights making you shine
My hand, your leg
Playlist playing
Even though I haven't made it yet
I'm dragging it, dropping it in my mind

You're a drive real slow, down a no lane road
To a house on a hill where the wild things grow
You're wake up in pajamas, not a trace of makeup on ya
You're a help her fix it, having breakfast with my momma
You're a take back home, home, home girl
Home, home, home girl
Take back home, home, home girl
Home, home, home girl

You're the kind I wanna take a ride with
Sit by on a Friday night
In the stadium lights, side by side
All the ladies like, "Yeah, she's doing just fine"
Everybody in the bleachers, they all gon' want to meet ya
From my teachers to my preacher
My little crowd pleaser
Parading with you feeling homecoming cool, yeah

I wanna drive real slow, down a no lane road
To a house on a hill where the wild things grow
You're wake up in pajamas, not a trace of makeup on ya
You're a help her fix it, having breakfast with my momma
You're a take back home, home, home girl
Home, home, home girl
Take back home, home, home girl
Home, home, home girl

You're a take back, you're a take back
You're a take back home girl
You're a take back home
You're a take back home girl

You got that down home, homegrown, found on good ground soul
That down home, home grown, found on good ground soul

You're a drive real slow, down a no lane road
To a house on a hill where the wild things grow
You're wake up in pajamas, not a trace of makeup on ya
You're a help her fix it, having breakfast with my momma
You're a take back home, home, home girl
Home, home, home girl
Take back home, home, home girl

Here it comes
Here it comes for me
At midnight, when I'm all alone
I feel it close
I feel it close
But I won't lose sleep
'Cause I'm better when I'm burnin' off

All the questions I don't need
On the ceiling, on repeat
Darker days are comin'
The darker days are comin', oh, oh-oh

I don't feel the water
I don't feel the water yet
I will never go down, go down, go down
I don't feel the water
I don't feel the water yet
I will never go down, go down, go down

We say, "No
No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no"

And so it goes
And so it goes away
As easy as you let it in
It's good to know
It's good to know
If I hold my breath
I can live without the oxygen

I was deep beneath it all
Lost my mind but not my soul
Darker days are runnin'
The darker days are runnin', oh, oh-oh

I don't feel the water
I don't feel the water yet
I will never go down, go down, go down
I don't feel the water
I don't feel the water yet
I will never go down, go down, go down

We say

(Oh)
(Oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh)

I don't feel the water
I don't feel the water yet
I will never go down, go down, go down
I don't feel the water
I don't feel the water yet
I will never go down, go down, go down

We say, "No
No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no"
We say, "No
No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no"
---------------------------------------------------
I get nothing in return from you
Even with the loyal things I do
When I confront you you don't like the truth
You run from fights back you know you're gonna lose

Don't act like I'm the one who wasting your time
Forgiving you is far away from my mind
Ain't giving you no second chances at all
For somebody real, yeah, I'd rather fall

You can't fix the damage with apologies
Can't forgive you anymore so I'ma leave
I'ma do it on my own like a G
Can't forgive you anymore so I'ma leave

I'ma spit a whole lotta game
Whole lotta, whole lotta, whole lotta game
To the other girls in my lane
Girls in my, girl in my, girls in my lane

I'ma spit a whole lotta game
Whole lotta, whole lotta, whole lotta game
To the other girls in my lane
Girls in my, girl in my, girls in my lane

I know damn well my solution is wrong
'Cause some don't gon' think that I'm just leading them on
It ain't like that, I just need to forget
All the memories of us in my head

Don't act like I'm the one who wasting your time
Forgiving you is far away from my mind
Ain't giving you no second chances at all
For somebody real, yeah, I'd rather fall

You can't fix the damage with apologies
Can't forgive you anymore so I'ma leave
I'ma do it on my own like a G
Can't forgive you anymore so I'ma leave

I'ma spit a whole lotta game
Whole lotta, whole lotta, whole lotta game
To the other girls in my lane
Girls in my, girl in my, girls in my lane

I'ma spit a whole lotta game
Whole lotta, whole lotta, whole lotta game
To the other girls in my lane
Girls in my, girl in my, girls in my lane

(BAW) you make decisions like you're unconscious
Girl, you better wake up
Didn't get a damn if your homegirl said
That it's right for us to break up
Break up like LEGOs
demo
You got the memo
Of you I had to let go, oh

This my therapy session
I'ma leave my crib at 11
Ain't coming back till the sunrise
Tryna spend the night with the fun side
That's right, that's right
I'll be lit like a flashlight
Liquor in my system
Getting me up

You can't fix the damage with apologies
Can't forgive you anymore so I'ma leave
I'ma do it on my own like a G
Can't forgive you anymore so I'ma leave

I'ma spit a whole lotta game
Whole lotta, whole lotta, whole lotta game
To the other girls in my lane
Girls in my, girl in my, girls in my lane

I'ma spit a whole lotta game
Whole lotta, whole lotta, whole lotta game
To the other girls in my lane
Girls in my, girl in my, girls in my lane

Don't act like I'm the one who wasting your time
Forgiving you is far away from my mind
Ain't giving you no second chances at all
For somebody real, yeah, I'd rather fall
---------------------------------------------------
So give me all your backseat lovin', lovin'

We look so small from the hill
It's so surreal how you make me feel
Put my head down on your chest
You look at me while I undress

You turning me on
Like a favorite song
All night long
Gonna be feeling like home
Feeling like home

So give me all your backseat lovin', lovin'
'Cause I really like the way you're holding, holding me
So don't let go now, don't let go now
Just give me all your backseat lovin', lovin'

We don't have time to hesitate
When I make you stay, no more mistakes
Looking at the skyline silhouette
Sippin' on my wine
You smoke your cigarettes

You turning me on
Like a favorite song
All night long
Gonna be feeling like home
Feeling like home

So give me all your backseat lovin', lovin'
'Cause I really like the way you're holding, holding me
So don't let go now, don't let go now
Just give me all your backseat lovin', lovin'

From the land where they drop niggas

Bring the thots and all their friends
Moving units coming thru and cash on deck
Foreign whips foreign chicks foreign garments
Who's next uzi and the tec leave em wet
Choppa bullets raining gang on his head (dots)
Tell my momma I got it no need for college
Not from Boston but marathon fuckin popping


Pussy nigga I ride with da fye

You want smoke better bring a vest
Who want smoke aim it at yo neck
Pussy nigga I ride with da fye
Ran a half a mill since Granny died

Je marche lentement sous la pluie
Sans penser a rien d'autre que lui

Je vois l'eau qui tombe
L'eau qui tombe
L'eau qui tombe

Tout l'Amour inassouvi
S'effacera sous la Pluie
J'n'y verrai plus que du feu
Ce sera merveilleux

L'Amour inassouvi
S'effacera sous la Pluie
J'n'y verrai plus que du feu
Ce sera merveilleux

Merveilleux
Et le bleu du ciel
Sera eternel
Comme si on etait vieux

Je marche lentement, j'ai envie
De n'penser a rien d'autre
A rien d'autre

Je vois l'eau qui part
L'eau qui part
L'eau qui part

Tout l'Amour inassouvi
S'effacera sous la Pluie
J'n'y verrai plus que du feu
Ce sera merveilleux

L'Amour inassouvi
S'effacera sous la Pluie
J'n'y verrai plus que du feu
Ce sera merveilleux

Merveilleux

L'Amour inassouvi
S'effacera sous la Pluie

Takin' it back, it's been for far too long
So brace yourself
'Cause it's time to move on
(Time to move on)

You'll find it hard 'til you realize
There's more to life than just empty lies
Time that we take our turn
Instead of pointing fingers
My mind's rewinding, my wheels run in place
We've all messed up, yeah, the devil's to blame
It's time that we move forward
I know that I'll move forward
I know there's something much more

So tell me what's the point in missing you?
When you don't say you love me too
Why waste all my time? It's deja vu
What do you need me to do?

I would die for you
I would die for you
(What do you need me to do?)

(I would die for you)

Believed all the lies
You said that I'd be nothing, well now
What a surprise
I guess we became something after all
You find it hard 'til you realize
There's more to life than just empty lies
It's time that we move forward
I know that I'll move forward
(I know there's something more, much more)

So tell me what's the point in missing you?
When you don't say you love me too
Why waste all my time? It's deja vu
What do you need me to do?

I would die for you
(What do you need me to do?)
I would die for you
(What do you need me to do?)
(I would die for you)
(I would die for you)

So battle with your selfish ways
To feel the way that you should miss
Rewind and move on forward
Why can't we just move forward?
I find it hard you can't realize
You're breaking down my restless eyes
Reflecting to the music
Gotta take the high road

(I would die for you)

One good thing could change the world

So tell me what's the point in missing you?
When you don't say you love me too?
Why waste all my time? It's deja vu
What do you need me to do?

I would die for you
(What do you need me to do?)
I would die for you
(What do you need me to do?)
I would die for you
(I would die for you)
I would die for you
(I would die for you)
---------------------------------------------------
Don't be a maybe
'Cause you can be king
Take a ride through the universe
Don't wait! begin!
It's your life, baby waste it
Before it's too late
Honey, don't you be afraid

Just be what you wanna be
And don't you be blind
See what you wanna see
Come on, make up your mind
Don't stop the travelling
Voices inside lead you
Straight into the light
Straight into the light

Boomtown baby
You can make it here
Boomtown baby
Right before you disappear

Travelling, travelling

Try baby, taste it
Time's not on your side
Feel what you have to
Don't try to hide
Your heart is a traveller
You've travelled so far
And here is where you are

You can make it here
Boomtown baby
Right before you disappear

Boomtown baby
You can make it here
Boomtown baby
Right before you disappear
You're gonna make it here
---------------------------------------------------
Still you see fire, you say
The endless course of ages
Our bleeding souls are getting weak
These loving birds, now they
Are lost inside their cages
Their songs of joy are running dry

What is the consequence?
Where are we now?
Where are we going to?
No, I didn't mean it
I feel so safe in your arms

We're running out of time, and now
We see our skies in trouble
We've burnt it down, with loving flames
We see our skies in trouble

The story goes that if
We once have turned the pages
We can't return to what we need
To what we need
What do we need?

We're running out of time, and now
We see our skies in trouble
We've burnt it down, with loving flames
And now our skies in trouble

With loving flames, we burned it down

C'mon folks let's raise the glass tonight
Forever hearts shall burn
No matter if it's right or wrong
We drink a toast to everyone

We're running out of time, and now
We see our skies in trouble
We've burnt it down, with loving flames
And now our skies in trouble

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
With loving flames
With loving flames
Our skies in trouble
---------------------------------------------------
Shame, shame, shame
It's not the wine, and it's not the rain
It's just a feeling that I can't explain

If you want to get in
She said youve got to get out, before
Why don't you try to begin?
Come on your life is an open door
Well, I dont want to make you promises
But when you look at this
It's such a shame

Shame, shame, shame
She left me out here in the rain
My life will never be the same
'Til she's back again
Shame, shame, shame
It's not the wine, and it's not the rain
It's just a feeling that I can't explain

She was the sweetest symphony
And I was blind as boys can be
I fell in love, and suddenly
She needed more than I could give
She spoke of time and space to live
Was too much space and time for me

When the feeling is gone
And the skies are all grey, you know
Baby try to walk on
Take your life in your hands and go
The better days will come for everyone
And you will find the sun (again)

Shame, shame, shame
She's left me out here in the rain
My life will never be the same
'Til she's back again
Shame, shame, shame
It's not the wine, and it's not the rain
It's just a feeling that I can't explain
Shame, shame, shame
Give me a puddle of champagne
My life will never be the same
'Til she's back again

It's a feeling that I can't explain
---------------------------------------------------
As I see you walking down the pathway
I take a look upon my life
So many years have passed, somehow I start to feel
I'm running out of time
Remember what my mother told me
She said: One day you`ll realize
The hardest thing is letting go the ones you love
While tears came to her eyes

All we are
Is all we need
Don't ever go with what your mind says
Listen to your heart
Let all your dreams run free

And when you need someone to talk to
Be sure I'll always be the one
You can rely on me whenever you're in need
Even when I'm gone

And all we are
Is all we need
Don't ever go with what your mind says
Listen to your heart
Let all your dreams run free

Don't ever try to please the others
For sure, I know you'll never do
Take your life and go
We'll crumble into dust one day
Protect your heart
And all your dreams

'Cause all we are
Is all we need
Don't ever go with what your mind says
Listen to your heart
Let all your dreams run free
Let all your dreams run free
You're a part of me
---------------------------------------------------
Muriel was born on a cold afternoon in November
84 years ago, changing the world with a cry
Reading the lines on her face, so much to remember
Her father was down by the lake when Samuel died

Marie, Marie
Lay down your hands on me
Once in a while, I don't see
A way out of here
Marie, Marie
Come on and dance with me
Into the light
'Cause I'm lost in the dark

Cyrus was talking 'bout war, he said time is a healer
What will remain of the stories that we all forget
They found him this morning in tears, down on the kneeler
He opened his heart and he lost everything that he had

Marie, Marie
Lay down your hands on me
Once in a while, I don't see
A way out of here
Marie, Marie
Come on and dance with me
Into the light
'Cause I'm lost in the dark

Oh Marie
Don't let it rain on me
Once in a while, I don't see
A way out of here
Marie, Marie
Dance to the light with me
Show me the way
'Cause I'm lost in the dark
---------------------------------------------------
I need some inspiration
A source that pushes me
A brand new perspective
An activation key
I'm so set in my ways
I'm bored of every
Thing that comes to my mind
I'm tired as can be

I'm talking 'bout
Big, big boys
From time to time they need a little kick in the pants
Big, big girls
Occasionally come along with helping hands (yeah)

The radio is playing
The same songs all the time
They stick in the rotation
Send shivers down my spine
I don't feel connected
I'm lost in lethargy
Terribly neglected
I guess I need a therapy

I'm talking 'bout
Big, big boys
From time to time they need a little kick in the pants
Big, big Girls
Occasionally come along with helping hands (yeah)
Big, big boys
From time to time they need a little kick in the pants
Big, big Girls
Occasionally come along with helping hands (yeah)

An hour in the shower
I got no energy
Oh god I miss the power
Will she come back to me?

Big, big boys
Climb up a mountain
Big, big boys
They run to the sea
Big, big boys (doo, doo, doo, doo, doo)
Won't you turn me on?

Ally has set his heart on fire
He's seventeen, so far away
From being cool, so much desire
No time to sleep, no place to stay

And find the golden key of life

And he wants get high again
And he wants to get high again

You can't stop the hands of father time
When the mornin' comes the sun's gonna rise
The clouds are gonna bring the rain
The songbirds are gonna sing

Those old six-string guitars are made for playin'
Mama's bendin' knees were made for prayin'
Plantin' seed was made to sew
And Jesus loves me, this I know

And every time I look into that mirror
The reflection I see is gettin' clearer
And who I am is who I'm gonna be
I wouldn't change a single thing
I'm proud of this blood in my veins
Like my daddy and his daddy before
I was made to be a country boy

The apple don't fall too far from the tree
Country music's made in Tennessee
A tractor's made to pull a plow
A plow is made to turn the ground

And every time I look into that mirror
The reflection I see is gettin' clearer
And who I am is who I'm gonna be
I wouldn't change a single thing
I'm proud of this blood in my veins
Like my daddy and his daddy before
I was made to be a country boy

I wouldn't change a single thing
I'm proud of this blood in my veins
Like my daddy and his daddy before
Every night I close my eyes and thank the Lord
I was made to be a country boy
I was made to be a country boy

Say we could go where our dreams are realized
We make the little sacrifice
It's a secret hallelujah
Paradise with all its hidden sights
Has to question is sometimes
I just want to see it clearer
When it feels like

There's nowhere to run, run, run
There's nowhere to hide
From the hurtful divide in this world
There's nowhere to run, run, run
Run, run, run, run away

I've been dreaming again
About the revolution in my head
I've been dreaming again
I've been dreaming again
About the revolution in my head
I've been dreaming again

On this road your beliefs can fade away
I'm only offering what I may
I just hope we find it sooner
Not alone, we've all felt out of place
Just a shade in the human race
And I can look right through ya

There's nowhere to run, run, run
There's nowhere to hide
From the hurtful divide in this world
There's nowhere to run, run, run
Run, run, run, run away

I've been dreaming again
About the revolution in my head
I've been dreaming again
I've been dreaming again
About the revolution in my head
I've been dreaming again

I've been dreaming again
About the revolution in my head
I've been dreaming again
I've been dreaming again
About the revolution in my head
I've been dreaming again

I've been dreaming again
About the revolution in my head
I've been dreaming again
I've been dreaming again
About the revolution in my head
I've been dreaming again

Uh huh. Uh huh. Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh

My sperm is nice and healthy
In terms of sperm, I'm wealthy
I'm like Warren Buffett
I got so much of it
That's what my doctors tell me

My point is in a nutshell
Each time I bust, I bust well
I got the quantity
And the quality
No IUD is stoppin' me

'Cause my semen's steamin' like a demon
And all the surrogates be screamin'
Just give me some of that
Premium-grade baby batter
I never splatter
My sperm, my sperm
Is no cause for concern

My sperm is healthy!
My sperm is healthy!
Aw shucks! Gee whiz!
I got the best sperm in the biz
My sperm is healthy!
My sperm is healthy!
My sperm is healthy

Even though I'm no teenager
My boys still throw a rager
They get bottle service
In every cervix
Blowin' eggs up like a pager

Every lady's gettin' fertilized
Got a diaphragm? It's gettin' pulverized
My sperm shines brighter than the sun
So wear special glasses or avert your eyes

Give thanks my tank's not shootin' blanks
I'm in a league of my own, just like Tom Hanks
Not a castaway
But I blast away
That thing I do
Is inseminate you
With my sperm, my sperm
The tests have all confirmed

His sperm is healthy!
His sperm is healthy!

Aw shucks! Gee whiz!
My sperm just aced the quiz
My sperm is healthy!
My sperm is healthy!

My sperm is healthy

Never ever gonna make the same mistakes again
And by the way
No one else could ever make me feel this good
But I'm all right
I swear that I'm all right again
Hope is in my veins
And I swear that I'm okay
Someone take me home

Is this important?
Can it wait a day?
I promise I'll be there
But do you need me, anyway?

I could leave this
I have control, I'm fine
That's not lip service
I talk circles all the time

'Cause I know that you know
That I need fixed tonight
So please don't worry

Never ever gonna make the same mistakes again
And by the way
No one else could ever make me feel this good
But I'm all right

Hope is in my veins
And I swear that I'm okay
Someone take me home

I could leave this
But I don't want to
And if I fall
I hope it's not in front of you

'Cause I know that you know
That I need fixed tonight
So please don't worry

Never ever gonna make the same mistakes again
And by the way
No one else could ever make me feel this good
But I'm all right
I swear that I'm all right again
Hope is in my veins
And I swear that I'm okay

If you see the hole I'm sinking

Well lawdy, lawdy, lawdy miss clawdy
Girl you sure look good to me
But please don't excite me baby
I know it can't be me

Well as a girl you want my money

You like to ball every morning
Don't come home till late at night

Oh gonna tell, tell my mama
Lord, I swear girl what you been to me
I'm gonna tell everybody that I'm down in misery

So bye, bye, bye, baby
Girl, I won't be comin' no more
Goodbye little darlin' down the road I'll go
So, bye, bye, bye baby
Girl, I won't be comin' no more
Goodbye little darlin' down the road I'll go

Did you ever have to make up your mind?
Pick up on one and leave the other one behind
It's not often easy, and not often kind
Did you ever have to make up your mind?

Did you ever have to finally decide?
Say yes to one and let the other one ride
There's so many changes, and tears you must hide
Did you ever have to finally decide?

Sometimes there's one with deep blue eyes, cute as a bunny
With hair down to here, and plenty of money
And just when you think she's that one in the world
Your heart gets stolen by some mousy little girl
And then you know you better make up your mind
Pick up on one and leave the other one behind
It's not often easy, and not often kind
Did you ever have to make up your mind?

Sometimes you really dig a girl the moment you kiss her
And then you get distracted by her older sister
When in walks her father and takes you in line
And says "Better go home, son, and make up your mind"
Then you bet you'd better finally decide!
And say yes to one and let the other one ride
There's so many changes, and tears you must hide
Did you ever have to finally decide?
---------------------------------------------------
Look at the stars above, what do you know?
What is this life about, where do we go?
We're only here for such a little piece of time
Look at the world and tell me what you see
There is a place that's made for you and me
In the eternal space somewhere along the line

And I burn
I burn
For you

I was a child, I was so innocent
Then I grew older tried to understand
I've lost my faith and suddenly I needed proof
The more I tried to find the reason why
The less I knew myself was blinded by
So many answers that were trying to explain

And I burn
I burn
And I burn forever for you

I close my eyes, I feel
You've fanned the flame in me
All we need is what we are
Our life has just begun
We shine as long as every star
In the empire of the sun

And I burn
I burn
And I burn forever and ever
And I burn
You light up my life
And I burn
I promise I burn for you
You light up my life
I promise I burn forever for you
---------------------------------------------------
Down you wait too long
For you and the wave don't belong
If you stay, it's your fault, it's yours, come on
Minds get blown, those dots connect, lines get drawn
But something draws me to you even more
And that something draws me to you
Something draws me to you
That something's got a hold on me
Takin' me higher than this ecstasy
I'm thinkin', ooh you drive me crazy
Ooh you drive me maybe, the wheel to take control of me

Minds get lost, dots connect, lines get drawn
But something draws me to you even more
And that something draws me to you
Something draws me to you
That something's got a hold on me

I said take control, don't take too long, the sky might fall
We all go through our phases, habits won't fade, these things evolve
So take your medication
That's only temporary aid, you need your salvation
Up your doses when it's less effective

I'll be your prisoner take me, I'll surrender my faith

We can't escape attraction, the chain reaction make me your slave
Minds get lost, dots connect, lines get drawn
But something draws me to you even more
And that something draws me to you
Something draws me to you
That something's got a hold on me
Takin' me higher than this earth can see
I'm thinkin', "Ooh you drive me crazy
Ooh you drive me maybe, the wheel to take control of me

Take control of me
Take control of me
Take control of me
Take control of me

See I can call again, call it that, something is drawin' me closer
Yeah, I'm drownin' my head above water, there ain't no warnin'
I will follow that light at the end of the tunnel, I want it
If it glows out, I'm cool with the darkness
Do anything for it, I promise I need it, your beauty is beamin'
I'm trapped in your glory, I can't ignore it
This feeling I'm feelin', I'm an infant I'm reachin'
At this point I'm dependin', pray I'm goin' the distance

But I know something's got a hold on me
Takin' me higher than this extasy?
Ooh you drive me crazy
Ooh you drive me maybe
The wheel to take control of me
But I know something's got a hold on me
Takin' me higher than this extasy
Ooh you drive me crazy
Ooh you drive me maybe
The wheel to take control of me
---------------------------------------------------
Earth's been colder
Stifled ways
Unforeseen wastage
Circumstances

And I want you to
You to feel
My heart
My, life hasn't changed me
I'm the same
I know I'm still foolish
I'm to blame
But I been looking out

And now with my same boots in the rain
I know I'm not hopeless I'm okay
I'm checking out

We step off this foolish world right now
With our backs up against the wall
We keep crying
We should be firing up instead

And all these things
Wasted on
Time keeps ticking
Going 'round again
It's all 'bout letting go

Wasting all these things
Wasted on
Time keeps ticking
Going 'round again
It's all 'bout letting go
So I let it go
So I let it go

Addiction to comfort
That's the game
When ignorance is rewarded
All the same
Let's get out

Won't be the last time we feel pain
I know we're not hopeless, we're okay
Just spit it out

We step off this foolish world right now
With our backs up against the wall
We keep crying
We should be firing up instead

And all these things
Wasted on
Time keeps ticking
Going 'round again
It's all 'bout letting go

Wasting all these things
Wasted on
Time keeps ticking
Going 'round again
It's all 'bout letting go
So I let it go

Wise man once told his son
Be all you can, be all you can be
It's as critical as water (wooh!)

And I'll pass that along
Be all you can, be all you can be
And life feels better when you smile

And all these things
Wasted on
Time keeps ticking
Going 'round again
It's all 'bout letting go

Wasting all these things
Wasted on
Time keeps ticking
Going 'round again
It's all 'bout letting go
---------------------------------------------------
The other day, I was thinking to myself
Made a list of all my mistakes
Oh, I wish I could've run to you
And tell you all about my heartbreak
And I wondered to myself "Wait a minute
Am I even on the right path now?"
Had a couple wins, but I got knocked down
But I know if you were still around, you would say

Sometimes you lose, sometimes you win
You gotta get up, up again
Keep holding on, it's not the end

You gotta get up, up again
You can get up, up again
You can get up, up again

And I guess not every little thing
Works out just the way you dreamed
You can take a couple wrong turns
Still end up where you're supposed to be
And even though in a moment
I know anything can change
You're perfect plans might fall apart
But the simple truth remains

Sometimes you lose, sometimes you win
You gotta get up, up again
Keep holding on, it's not the end

You gotta get up, up again
You, you can get up, up again
You can get up, up again
You, you can get up, up again
You can get up, up again

'Cause you've only got one life
And you don't know when it ends
You've only got one heart
So get out there and live
Yeah, you've only got one life
Don't let it get away
Everyone falls down
But you can get up, up again

You, you can get up, up again
You can get up, up again

And I guess not every little thing
Works out just the way you dreamed
You can take a couple wrong turns
Still end up where you're supposed to be
---------------------------------------------------
Tom and Johnny yeah we're low on cash
Noisemaker, dream chaser
Still crashing at my parents pad
Coming up and I want it so bad
Debaser, game changer
And the weekend will be so damn rad

Freaks go out, gonna drown our fears
Brains go numb, bodies get so weird
We fight so hard for new vibration
Oh oh oh they'll have to carry us home
Oh oh oh they'll have to carry us home
Oh oh oh they'll have to carry us home
We fight so hard for new vibration
Oh oh oh they'll have to carry us home
We fight so hard for new vibration
Oh oh oh they'll have to carry us home

Like a walk of shame
Love sick again
And I'm stumbling
Breaking even when I wake up dazed
I think I might've left the car unlocked
My shades are gone, whose shoes I got on?
But whatever 'cause we pay to play

Freaks go out, gonna drown our fears
Brains go numb, bodies get so weird
We fight so hard for new vibration
Oh oh oh they'll have to carry us home
Oh oh oh they'll have to carry us home
Oh oh oh they'll have to carry us home
We fight so hard for new vibration
Oh oh oh they'll have to carry us home
We fight so hard for new vibration
Oh oh oh they'll have to carry us home

Freaks go out, gonna drown our fears
Brains go numb, bodies get so weird
We fight so hard for new vibration
Oh oh oh they'll have to carry us home

Freaks go out (gonna carry us home)
Brains go numb, bodies get so (gonna carry us home)
We fight so hard for new vibration
Oh oh oh they'll have to carry us home

One!


Two!


One, two, three, four!


We know what people think when we see us


That we're so hot, it's insane


Ane! Ane! Ane!


When we exit a pool, we do it in slow-motion


But that don't mean we can't complain


'Cause fit hot guys have problems, too
Don't look at us, we're not dancing for you
This is our quiet personal time to reflect
(Flect! Flect! Flect! Flect!)

We have almost no body fat
But we're too bummed out to talk about that
I know we look so much better than you
But fit hot guys have problems, too
Uh!


Everyone is at our sexual mercy
Be them a mister


Or miss


Miss! Miss! Miss!


But when we're down on our knees


No one has sympathy


Because they only see this
And this and this and this and this and this
But what about this?

'Cause fit hot guys have problems, too
Don't look at us, we're not dancing for you
It's just hard to process emotions with our clothes on
(Clothes on! Clothes on! Clothes on!)

Our pecs are perfect, but we have bad days
So don't objectify us with your male and female gaze
We have childhood traumas just like you
'Cause fit hot guys have problems, too
Uh!


Give us back our shirts, you monsters!


Yeah, what is wrong with you?


Come on, guys!


Uh, Josh?


No!


Are you actually here? Like, in reality?


Yeah, this is my new job. I'm a go-go dancer at this club


That's what you meant by volunteer fireman. Okay, got it


You wanna join our imaginary song and dance?


Sure


'Cause fit hot guys have problems, too
Don't look at us, we're not dancing for you
Leave us alone, because we have to twerk out our sad
(Sad! Sad! Sad! Sad! Sad! Sad! Sad! Sad!)

We're expressing our pain through the art of dance
But we'll express so much better without these pants
There's so much pressure when you're a fit hot guy
So just let us ugly cry! Let us ugly cry!
---------------------------------------------------
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Cryin' all the time
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Cryin' all the time
Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit
And you ain't no friend of mine

When they said you was high-classed
Well, that was just a lie
When they said you was high-classed
Well, that was just a lie
You ain't never caught a rabbit
And you ain't no friend of mine

You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Cryin' all the time
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Cryin' all the time
Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit
And you ain't no friend of mine

When they said you was high-classed
Well, that was just a lie
When they said you was high-classed
Well, that was just a lie
Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit
And you ain't no friend of mine

When they said you was high-classed
Well, that was just a lie
You know they said you was high-classed
Well, that was just a lie
Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit
And you ain't no friend of mine

You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Cryin' all the time
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Cryin' all the time

There's a place in my mind
That I lost
So you'll have to find yourself
'Cause it takes so much time
To say goodbye

There's a place in my mind
That I lost
So you'll have to find yourself
You're better off in your case
You'll get by
Despite the cost of it
You'll just have to find yourself

You never really tried to rest your case
Just in case
You never get to tie your own noose
To escape
'Cause it takes so much time
To say goodbye

There's a place in my mind
That I lost
Where you resided in
So you'll have to find yourself
A place where no one minds
And there's no consequence
For you to go and tie your own noose

You never really tried to rest your case
Just in case
You never get to tie your own noose
To escape
'Cause it takes so much time
To say goodbye
'Cause it takes so much time
To say goodbye
Say goodbye

Try to rest your case just in case
You never get to tie your own noose
To escape
'Cause it takes so much time
'Cause it takes so much time
'Cause it takes so much time
To say goodbye
---------------------------------------------------
I think we stopped somewhere along
Just motions memorized and we're left twisting our tongues
We still make love but it's tearing us apart
When movement stops, we're strangers lying in the dark

And I don't wanna get by, get by, get by with you
I don't wanna get high to paralyze my mind
Distract ourselves into thinking we make sense
Distract ourselves into thinking we make sense
Thinking we make sense
Thinking we make

We're both too tired, can't break the quiet
Too scared to recognize how estranged we've become

And I don't wanna get by, get by, get by with you
I don't wanna get high to paralyze my mind
Distract ourselves into thinking we make sense
Distract ourselves into thinking we make sense
Distract ourselves into thinking we make sense
Distract ourselves into thinking we make sense
Thinking we make sense
Thinking we make

And I don't wanna get by, get by, get by with you
I don't wanna get high to paralyze my mind
And I don't wanna get by, get by, get by with you
I don't wanna get high to paralyze my mind
Distract ourselves into thinking we make sense
Distract ourselves into thinking we make sense
Distract ourselves into thinking we make sense
Distract ourselves into thinking we make sense
Thinking we make sense
Thinking we make

I'm a beast, standing 200 solid
I hollered, "Squad up", there go a riot
All outside his noggin, then upside her derriere
Squad niggas throwing bottles, squad niggas throwing chairs
We don't care, we out of control
I'm 'bout to lose my mind, my mind is so gone
Yes, so gone 'cause everything green
If I holler, "Squad up", bitch, you know what that mean: fight


Fight, fight, bitch, we finna fight
Fight, fight, bitch, we finna fight
Fight, fight, bitch, we finna fight (Hit Squad)
What's your hand game like? (Brick Squad)
What's your hand game like?
East side (my boys down to fight)
West side (them boys down to fight)
North side (them boys down to fight)
South side (boy, we down to fight)


Nigga in the club popping at the mouth
Talking loud, making a scene, ay, we gon' stomp him out
You must be drunk, nigga, gone off that vodka
Capp, Gotti, Waka, somebody call a doctor
Ain't no bucking over here, you're getting your ass whooped
Get your chain snatched, get your cash took
Get your girl fucked, we'll fuck your girl up
One hitter quitter, nigga, it's too late to curl up
You ain't touching me, don't think about rushing me
A hundred green flags, I got goons that'll bust for free
But we in the club and it's time to fight
It's going down, swing on a nigga you don't like


Fight, fight, bitch, we finna fight
Fight, fight, bitch, we finna fight
Fight, fight, bitch, we finna fight (Hit Squad)
What's your hand game like? (Brick Squad)
What's your hand game like?
East side (my boys down to fight)
West side (them boys down to fight)
North side (them boys down to fight)
South side (boy, we down to fight)


All pussy ass niggas left in the motherfucking edge right now, my nigga
Hit Squad, Brick Squad, Dirt Gang in this bitch?
Oh man, we gotta get the fuck out of here, my nigga
And Tay Beatz in this bitch, nigga?
Ay, Chaz, don't knock a nigga out to this one
Pussy ass niggas gon' fuck around and shoot up this bitch

Yo quiero ser el sastre de tu amor
Hoy quiero hacertelo a la medida
Yo quiero que dos copas de licor
Nos pongan otra vez a la deriva

Y medir despacito todito tu cuerpo
Cocer con ternura tu pecho en mi pecho
Hacer que tu pelo se enrede en mi pelo
Yo soy costurero y tu mi modelo

Descoser suavecito toda tu cintura
Hilar sin modales toda esta locura
Perder el control en esta figura
Yo soy alfiler y tu mi costura, baby

Yo quiero ser el sastre de tu amor
Hoy quiero hacertelo a la medida
Yo quiero que dos copas de licor
Nos pongan otra vez a la deriva

Quisiera trazarte como cirujano
Tu cara, tu cuerpo, tu espacio
Mis manos bajando a la zona prohibida
Justo a la medida y ahi vamos

Tu amor es medicina exacta
Soy sastre de tu alma
Tomando las medidas de tu corazon

No se que pasa con tu calma
Que siempre me desarma
Me alarma, me sube y me baja
Creo que todo eso es mental
Y lo fundamental es tocarte

Yo quiero ser el sastre de tu amor
Hoy quiero hacertelo a la medida
Yo quiero que dos copas de licor
Nos pongan otra vez a la deriva
---------------------------------------------------
Rain from the cloud flowing out my mouth
Rivers and streams made of all my doubts
Looking everywhere but the here and now
All these storms coming back around

Three in Fire
Five in Water
One like a son
One like a daughter

Gotta break that cycle break it strong
This been going on way too long
Being human so confusing
Some winning sometime losing

Karma
You got me thinking again
Of all this virtue and sin
That's going round and round and

Karma
Now as your cycle returns
Between the sky and the earth
It's nice to meet you again

Roaming through that scorpio
Stinging myself with everything I hold
Better know my stars to know my soul
This current's strong so I learn to row
I learn to row

Because nothing is as it may seem
Don't believe everything you think
When the mind is spinning
What to believe?
Root down strong like a banyan tree
I see this is the law of creation
My being is one constellation
All in all it's all divination
Elevating my meditation with
Karma

You got me thinking again
Of all this virtue and sin
That's going round and round and

Karma
Now as your cycle returns
Between the sky and the earth
It's nice to meet you again

Karma
You got me thinking again
Of all this virtue and sin
That's going round and round and

Karma
Now as your cycle returns
Between the sky and the earth
It's nice to meet you again

Karma
You got me thinking again
... round and round and

Karma
Now as your cycle returns
Between the sky and the earth
It's nice to meet you again

Adieu tchin tchin
Je sens qu'y'a plus de place dans le jean
Je sens qu'y'a plus l'espace pour
Un happy ending

Adieu tchin thcin
Faut que je pete toute la vaisselle de Chine
Que je casse ta belle gueule de skin
Faut pas que je courbe l'echine

On fera pas de vieux jours
J'lance la bouteille a l'amour
Far away vers l'ocean
J'sais pas faire semblant
Mais je t'aimerai toujours
Avec les vagues tout autour
Accrochee comme une enfant
A notre recipient

Adieu tchin tchin
Avant toi j'etais qu'une gamine
Avant toi j'avais le cur blond platine

Adieu tchin tchin
J'reviendrai roder sur nos ruines
J'reviendrai me rouler dans le spleen
Avec toutes mes copines

On fera pas de vieux jours
Je lance la bouteille a l'amour
Far away vers l'ocean faut pas faire semblant
Mais je t'aimerai toujours
Avec les vagues tout autour
Accrochee comme une enfant
A notre recipient

Adieu tchin tchin
T'as fait d'ma vie un truc sublime
D'entre nous deux, c'est toi l'mieux
J'traine pour les deux
Tant mieux

And when I asked for a separate room
It was late at night, and we'd been driving since noon
But if I'd known how that would sound to you
I would have stayed in your bed for the rest of my life
Just to prove I was right
That it's harder to be friends than lovers
And you shouldn't try to mix the two
'Cause if you do it and you're still unhappy
Then you know that the problem is you
And it's true that I stole your lighter
And it's also true that I lost the map
But when you said that I wasn't worth talking to
I had to take your word on that
But if you'd known how that would sound to me
You would have taken it back
And boxed it up and buried it in the ground
Boxed it up and buried it in the ground
Boxed it up and buried it in the ground
Burned it up and thrown it away
You put in my hands a loaded gun
And then told me not to fire it
When you did the things you said were up to me
And then accused me of trying to fuck it up
But you've never been a waste of my time
It's never been a drag
So take a deep breath and count back from ten
And maybe you'll be alright
And the license said you had to stick around until I was dead
But if you're tired of looking at my face, I guess I already am
But you've never been a waste of my time
It's never been a drag
So take a deep breath and count back from ten
And maybe you'll be alright
---------------------------------------------------
